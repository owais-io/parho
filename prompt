from git status command, check new articles in directory content/articles. now check if any of these fit in already existing categories, if yes change their categories to the existing categories or else retain the new . Do you understand what i am asking for ? dont do anything, first tell me what do you understand?

now check that all categories on the categories page, when clicked upon, open a new page and does not return 404.

go on the categories page, and check all the cateogires. you will find many categoires similar. merge the similar categories. but do not make the categories sound general in order to merge them. Categories should be specific and reader should have a sense of the stories in the category but just reading the name of the category. Category name's length should be at least 3 words and not more than 4 words. Secondly, the posts in content/articles need to be updated with the merged/new cateogry name.
