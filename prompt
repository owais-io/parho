  From all MDX posts in content/articles/, extract the `category` field from frontmatter (not section). Then:

  1. Create `categories_raw.txt` with all unique categories found
  2. Create `category_analysis.md` analyzing categories for consolidation:
     - Spelling/case variations (e.g., "politics" vs "Politics")
     - Semantic duplicates (e.g., "Tech" vs "Technology")
     - Synonyms (e.g., "Soccer" vs "Football")
     - Abbreviations (e.g., "AI" vs "Artificial Intelligence")
     - Regional variations (e.g., "Labour" vs "Labor")
     - Contextual/topical overlap (e.g., "Trump Administration" and "White House" → "Politics")
     - Hierarchical consolidation (e.g., "Premier League", "Carabao Cup" → "Football")
     - Interpretation-based merging (different names serving same editorial purpose)

  3. Create `category_mappings.json` mapping every old category to its canonical version
  4. Apply mappings to all MDX files, updating the category field
  5. Create `categories_consolidated.txt` with the final canonical category list
  6. Show me a summary of changes: files updated, before/after category counts





now check out all mdx summaries, which do not have Ollama generated categories (which only have section tag in frontmatter and not category) , make one time thing on admin panel, when i click that one time button, it should start generating ollama generated category and if i quit and resume , it should skip already done and generate the category for remaining summaries. generate categories after reading summary only . then those summaries should reflect in ollama generated category not the guardian ones . show some progress in console logs





now check out all mdx summaries, which do not have category (which only have section tag in frontmatter and not category) , generate  category after reading summary only . then those summaries should reflect on the website in categories generated by you, not the guardian ones which is section . category should be specific and not be more than 3 words . do it in batches of ten or what ever way which is efficient and fast. do you understand what i am asking
