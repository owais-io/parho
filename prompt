from git status command, check new articles in directory content/articles. now check if any of these fit in already existing categories, if yes change their categories to the existing categories or else retain the new . Do you understand what i am asking for ? dont do anything, first tell me what do you understand?

now check that all categories on the categories page, when clicked upon, open a new page and does not return 404.
