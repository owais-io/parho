From git status, check new articles in content/articles directory. Normalize their categories to match existing categories in the database/tracked files. If a new article's category 
  is similar to an existing one, update it to use the existing category. Keep categories that are genuinely new.

  1. Get Existing Categories (from tracked/committed articles)                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  git ls-files content/articles/*.mdx | xargs grep "^category:" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*category: "//' | sed 's/"$//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn                                        
  This gives you all categories currently in use with their counts.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  2. Get New Article Categories (from untracked files)                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  git status --porcelain | grep "^??" | grep "content/articles" | cut -c4- | xargs grep "^category:" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*category: "//' | sed 's/"$//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn   
  This shows categories in the new untracked articles.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  3. Compare and Create Mapping                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Manually or programmatically map new categories to existing ones based on similarity:

  - Database: articles.db (has sectionName column, but categories are in MDX files)  










  
now check that all categories on the categories page, when clicked upon, open a new page and does not return 404.

go on the categories page, and check all the cateogires. you will find many categoires similar. merge the similar categories. but do not make the categories sound general in order to merge them. Categories should be specific and reader should have a sense of the stories in the category but just reading the name of the category. Category name's length should be at least 3 words and not more than 4 words. Secondly, the posts in content/articles need to be updated with the merged/new cateogry name. Do you understand what i am asking for ? dont do anything, first tell me what do you understand?
