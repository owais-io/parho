title: "US, UK, and Russia all after a rusty tanker in the Atlantic"
summary: "A 300‑metre, rust‑covered tanker called the Marinera has turned into a global flashpoint. The U.S. seized it after Russia sent a submarine to escort the ship, which was flying a Russian flag even though it had no oil aboard. Analysts think the vessel may be hiding weapons or used for secret trade between Iran and Venezuela. Britain helped by monitoring the tanker with spy planes, while U.S. forces kept a close eye from the start, ready for a quick raid."
