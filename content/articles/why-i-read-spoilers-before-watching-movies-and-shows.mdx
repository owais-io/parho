title: "Why I Read Spoilers Before Watching Movies and Shows"
summary: "I love looking up movie plots before I watch them, and I do it often. After the last episode of *Top Boy* aired, I posted a spoiler tweet that sparked a lot of complaints. I believe spoilers can ease the worry of not knowing what will happen, especially with so much new content. Knowing the ending lets you spot hints and feel ahead of the story. I don’t share spoilers with others, though."
