title: "Netflix Buys Warner Bros After Tough Years"
summary: "Netflix is buying Warner Bros and HBO from Warner Bros Discovery for about $82 billion. The move follows a merger that was supposed to boost the studio’s value, but after five years the deal has largely fallen short. Warner’s CEO, David Zaslav, earned $52 million last year, while the company’s stock has slid and its movie releases have struggled. Fans say the streaming service still has a confusing brand, and the promised benefits for creators and investors haven’t materialised."
