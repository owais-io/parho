title: "UK Lawyers Say Cutting Jury Trials Is a Huge Mistake"
summary: "Over 100 lawyers sent a letter to the UK Ministry of Justice, warning that plans to cut most jury trials and replace them with judge‑only cases would be a huge mistake. They say the changes won’t fix the backlog of 80,000 pending cases and will hurt victims, erode public trust, and remove a long‑standing right. The government will announce the reforms next week, sparking sharp backlash from judges, barristers and civil‑society groups."
