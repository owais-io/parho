title: "Fan Fiction Is Real Literature, Even if Critics Disagree"
summary: "Fan fiction lets readers rewrite stories when the originals miss the mark. It’s a democratic form of writing where fans fill gaps, give characters more backstory, or change endings. Critics say it lacks originality and polish, but fans argue it’s about emotional healing and keeping beloved stories alive. The genre has shaped pop culture, sparked successful books, and given queer readers a place to see themselves. In short, fan fiction is rebellious, democratic, and real literature."
