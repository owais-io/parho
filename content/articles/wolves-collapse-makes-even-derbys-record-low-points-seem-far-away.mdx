title: "Wolves’ collapse makes even Derby’s record low points seem far away"
summary: "Wolves lost to Brentford at home, earning just two points from 17 games. That is the worst start in English league history. The club has sold key players for years without buying new talent, leaving a weaker squad. Managers changed from Vitor Pereira to Rob Edwards, and the chairman resigned.
