title: "BMA Staff Threaten Strike Over Pay, Critics Call Union Hypocritical"
summary: "The British Medical Association (BMA) is in crisis after its own clerical workers, represented by the GMB union, threaten to strike because they want better pay. Meanwhile, resident doctors—who already have been striking—also lack a fair deal. Talks between the BMA and GMB broke down, and the BMA says it can only offer modest raises because of tight budgets. GMB says the BMA has cut staff wages for years, making the union’s criticism of government pay cuts seem hypocritical."
