title: "Coasting: The New Trend for Enjoying Alcohol Responsibly"
summary: "Coasting means choosing drinks that are about half the usual alcohol strength, like lighter wine or lager, so you can have more drinks without feeling bad. The trend has grown fast—mid‑strength wine sales jumped 4,000% in 2025. Brits are drinking less overall, but people still want tasty drinks, so supermarkets stock more low‑alcohol options. Many shoppers mix mid‑strength, alcohol‑free, and regular drinks at the same night."
