title: "International War Laws Fail as 100,000+ Civilians Die"
summary: "A new study called War Watch looked at 23 conflicts worldwide from mid‑2024 to the end of 2025. It found that more than 100,000 civilians were killed, and many crimes like torture, rape and targeted attacks on children and women happened with little punishment. Gaza, Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of the Congo were the worst spots. The report says we must stop arms sales that can fuel war crimes and boost the International Criminal Court."
