title: "Sea urchins facing extinction due to ocean disease"
summary: "Scientists say that an unknown disease has almost wiped out sea urchins in the Canary Islands and other parts of the world. Since 2021, the Diadema africanum urchin population fell by almost 100% in Tenerife and 90% around Madeira. The loss hurts coral reefs, because urchins help keep algae in check. Researchers think shipping and currents may spread the disease, but they are still studying what caused it."
