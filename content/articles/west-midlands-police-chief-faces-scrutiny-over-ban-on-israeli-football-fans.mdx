title: "West Midlands Police Chief Faces Scrutiny Over Ban on Israeli Football Fans"
summary: "A report by the UK police watchdog found that West Midlands Police wrongly pushed for a ban on Israeli fans at a Birmingham football match. The report says the force used shaky evidence, misread Dutch police data, and over‑stated how much trouble the fans caused. Because the chief constable is not the one who can fire the chief, the Police and Crime Commissioner will decide if he stays. He will meet the chief on January 27 to discuss the issue."
