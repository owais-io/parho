title: "What Is Bam? The Climate Plan Everyone Is Talking About"
summary: "Bam is a climate proposal pushed by activists to make sure a low‑carbon shift leaves workers and communities behind. The idea, called a just‑transition mechanism, would set rules for countries to plan new jobs, share best practices, use debt‑free finance and transfer technology to poorer nations. At COP30, about 80 % of the world’s population backed Bam, while big powers like the UK and Japan opposed it. The plan was built by NGOs, labour, youth and Indigenous groups."
