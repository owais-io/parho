title: "Will the new workers’ rights bill be signed into law before Christmas?"
summary: "Business groups have urged the Lords to finish the workers’ rights bill, hoping it will be signed into law before Christmas. They are still unhappy about removing the cap on unfair‑dismissal compensation but worry more about delays that could undo last month’s compromise, a six‑month protection period. The bill leaves many details, like guaranteed‑hours contracts, to be sorted out later, so even after assent implementation will take time."
