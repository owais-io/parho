summary: "Last week, leaked WhatsApp messages showed Reform UK Wales’s communications director calling a Guardian columnist a swear word. But the real worry is how the party treats scrutiny and the press. They’ve blocked reporters, banned a local paper, and let councillors skip meetings. The party also has no Welsh leader and is full of infighting, raising alarm about how Reform would run if it gained power."
