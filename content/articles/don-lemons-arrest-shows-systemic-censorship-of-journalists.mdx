title: "Don Lemon's Arrest Shows Systemic Censorship of Journalists"
summary: "Two federal courts said they shouldn't have arrested Don Lemon, but the attorney‑general kept pushing the case, showing how the Trump administration is targeting journalists. Lemon, Georgia Fort and Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson are all being charged with crimes that don’t fit the facts. The government is using vague conspiracy laws to punish reporters for simply covering protests, a pattern that has also hit smaller local papers. The press argues this is a threat to free speech."
