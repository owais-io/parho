title: "Families Lose Child Benefit Payments Over Faulty Travel Data; MPs Call for Inquiry"
summary: "UK families got their child‑benefit payments stopped because the government used wrong travel data. The data said they left the country and never came back, but many of them stayed in Britain. MPs, including Andrew Snowden, want a full, independent investigation into how this happened. The Treasury and Liberal Democrats are also asking for answers. Families, some refugees and hospital patients, are in financial distress and feel unfairly accused."
