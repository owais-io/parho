title: "Don’t Cancel a Party Invitation at the Last Minute"
summary: "When a party is about to happen, it’s best not to back out at the last minute. A host needs to know how many guests will come to plan food, drinks, and space. If you can’t attend, let the host know ahead of time or, if it’s a big gathering, just keep quiet—no need to send a barrage of apologies. Small dinners can get a short apology later, but big parties often expect some drop‑outs."
