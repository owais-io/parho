title: "Scientists use laser to write data in glass for thousands of years"
summary: "Scientists at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab have found a way to lock digital information inside glass using a femtosecond laser, creating tiny dents that act as data bits. A 12‑square‑centimetre glass piece can hold almost 5 TB—about two metres of books—and the storage could survive over 10,000 years at room temperature. The method is fast, automated, and suited for large cloud data centers, not home PCs."
