summary: "The European Legal Support Center and Forensic Architecture have documented over 900 incidents of repression against people supporting Palestine in Britain over six years. Targets include students, teachers, activists and cultural workers, facing smear campaigns, doxing, visa cancellations, blacklisting, job loss and arrests, often justified by claims of antisemitism or terrorism. The report shows a widespread, uncoordinated system that stifles free speech and civil society."
