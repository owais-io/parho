title: "Storm Goretti leaves Cornwall without broadband, showing infrastructure failings"
summary: "People in Cornwall, especially remote places like Cucurrian, lost power, water, and broadband after Storm Goretti knocked down trees and wires. Residents struggled to stay connected for work, health, and family. Openreach has been slow to restore service, and the shift to fibre may leave communities more vulnerable. Local leaders say Cornwall needs better infrastructure and more devolved control to prepare for future storms."
