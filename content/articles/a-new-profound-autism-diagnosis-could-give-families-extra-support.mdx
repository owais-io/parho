title: "A New ‘Profound Autism’ Diagnosis Could Give Families Extra Support"
summary: "A new study in Australia looked at whether a proposed ‘profound autism’ category could help children with the greatest support needs. The group says about one‑quarter of autistic children might fit this label, which requires no language and an IQ under 50. The idea is to make funding and services clearer, but experts worry it could push families to re‑test and might overlook other high‑need kids."
