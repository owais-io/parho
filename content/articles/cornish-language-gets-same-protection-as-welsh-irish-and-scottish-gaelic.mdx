title: "Cornish Language Gets Same Protection as Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic"
summary: "Britain’s government has moved to give the Cornish language the same high-level protection as Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. By gaining part‑III status under the European charter, Cornish will be promoted in schools, courts, media and life, and people will have the right to use it in legal hearings. Though only 563 people said it’s their first language, up to 5,000 can speak basic Cornish, and the language is seeing a revival with more lessons, dictionary searches and school programmes."
