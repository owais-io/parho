title: "Scotland Sends Baby Box to New York City Mayor"
summary: "New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said he wants a “baby basket” for first‑time parents, so the Scottish government sent a baby box as an example. The box comes with clothes, books, a thermometer and even a sleeping space, and has helped over 360,000 families in Scotland since 2017. By sharing this model, Scotland hopes the mayor will add a similar scheme to fight child poverty and the cost of living in NYC."
