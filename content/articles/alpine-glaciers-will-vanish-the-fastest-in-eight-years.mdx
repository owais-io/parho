title: "Alpine Glaciers Will Vanish the Fastest in Eight Years"
summary: "A new study says the glaciers in the Alps will hit their highest rate of loss in about eight years, with more than 100 gone by 2033. Similar patterns are expected in the western US and Canada, where over 800 could disappear each year a decade later. The research links the speed of melting to how much we still burn fossil fuels and shows how losing glaciers hurts water supplies, tourism and cultural traditions."
