title: "Which Farm Makes the Smelliest Silage?"
summary: "I went to the Nags Head in Peterchurch to watch the Eskleyside Agricultural Society's silage contest. Farmers bring bags of fermented grass, maize, and mixed crops, and judges sniff and rub them to judge sweetness, texture and colour. Winners are announced for baled silage and haylage. The event keeps small hill farms alive, but farmers worry big farms could replace them."
