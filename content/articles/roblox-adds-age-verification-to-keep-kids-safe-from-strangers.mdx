title: "Roblox Adds Age Verification to Keep Kids Safe from Strangers"
summary: "Roblox is launching a new age‑check feature in Australia that uses the phone camera to estimate how old a player is. Those checked are grouped by age and can only chat with peers in the same or similar age brackets. The feature becomes mandatory in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands from December, then spreads worldwide. Roblox argues it isn’t a social‑media platform, so it shouldn’t fall under Australia’s under‑16 ban."
