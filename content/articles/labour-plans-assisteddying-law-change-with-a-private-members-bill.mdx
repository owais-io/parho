title: "Labour plans assisted‑dying law change with a private member’s bill"
summary: "Labour, still in opposition, drafted a memo showing it wanted to change assisted‑dying laws via a private member’s bill. The bill would let mentally competent, terminally ill people with less than six months to live choose to die. The memo says the government would still have much influence, sparking debate in the House of Lords. Critics say Labour bypassed normal policy steps; the party insists the government stayed neutral and MPs can vote freely."
