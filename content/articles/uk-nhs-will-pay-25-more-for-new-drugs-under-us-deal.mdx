title: "UK NHS will pay 25% more for new drugs under US deal"
summary: "UK’s NHS will pay 25 % more for new medicines by 2035 after a deal with the US, adding about £3 bn a year. The agreement raises the NHS’s drug budget and lets the health watchdog NICE accept higher prices for life‑saving drugs. Critics say Trump pushed the deal and it will strain NHS budgets. NHS leaders argue the extra cost will give patients access to new treatments, but funding the rise remains a challenge."
