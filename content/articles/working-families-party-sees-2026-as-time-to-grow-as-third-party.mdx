summary: "The Working Families Party says 2026 is the perfect time to become a serious third party.

They’ll back candidates in Democratic primaries, push for higher wages, better safety nets, and cleaner elections. With 600,000 members and a presence in 18 states, they’re ready to challenge the two‑party system."
