title: "What We Eat at Christmas Says Who We Are"
summary: "Many African‑diaspora families treat Christmas food as both personal and shared. A table may have plantains, coleslaw, fried or jollof rice, roasted chicken or turkey, and starters called small chops. In Britain, dishes like mac‑and‑cheese, fufu, and spicy stews also appear. In Brazil, cassava farofa goes with turkey. A common drink is hibiscus sorrel, steeped in flowers and spiced with ginger or cloves. These foods bring family, history, and community together."
