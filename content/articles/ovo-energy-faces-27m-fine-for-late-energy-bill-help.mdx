title: "Ovo Energy Faces £2.7m Fine for Late Energy Bill Help"
summary: "Ovo Energy is paying a £2.7m penalty after it missed a deadline to give vulnerable customers their government‑backed Warm Home Discount. The company was almost two years late in passing £150 off electricity bills to around 12,000 people, many of whom were low‑income or medically vulnerable. Ofgem said the delay hurt those already struggling with high winter costs, and will keep watching suppliers to prevent similar problems."
