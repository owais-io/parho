title: "England Lowers Blood Level in Stool Test to Spot Bowel Cancer Earlier"
summary: "England will lower the blood level in a stool test to spot bowel cancer earlier. The change will let the test detect cancer with only 80 micrograms of blood per gram of stool, down from 120. The NHS expects to find 600 more cancers each year, cutting late‑stage cases and saving about £32 m a year. More people will get colonoscopies, and the test will reach those aged 50‑53."
