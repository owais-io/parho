title: "Scotland‑France ferry may restart as Dunkirk rebuilds"
summary: "Scotland’s Rosyth could soon get a new ferry to Dunkirk in France, the two‑way service that stopped in 2010. The move comes as Dunkirk launches a €35 bn regeneration plan that will turn the old port into a green‑energy hub with battery factories and a new rail terminal. The new route would run three times a week, a 20‑hour sail that could also help Scottish rugby fans travel to the Six Nations."
