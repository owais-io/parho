title: "Trump’s kidnapping of Venezuela’s president could spark more problems"
summary: "Trump’s administration said it was kidnapping Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to stop drug trafficking and protect the U.S. They offered a $50 million reward, blockaded Venezuelan ports, and claimed Maduro had ties to fentanyl and other crimes, but no proof exists. The move isn’t backed by any real threat to U.S. troops and violates international law. It could spark violence inside Venezuela, give the U.S. a pretext to run the country, and even tempt Trump into similar actions elsewhere, like Iran."
