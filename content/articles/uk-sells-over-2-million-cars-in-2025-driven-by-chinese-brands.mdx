title: "UK sells over 2 million cars in 2025, driven by Chinese brands"
summary: "UK car sales rose above 2 million in 2025, helped by Chinese brands that took 9.7% of new cars, about 196,000. Electric car sales hit a record 473,000, making up 23.4% of all cars and cutting average emissions by 10%. European makers lost market share as MG, BYD and Chery grew fast. The government is easing electric‑vehicle targets, but a future pay‑per‑mile fee may slow sales."
