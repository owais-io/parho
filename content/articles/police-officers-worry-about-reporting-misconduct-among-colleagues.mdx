title: "Police officers worry about reporting misconduct among colleagues"
summary: "Police officers in England and Wales are scared to report fellow officers' bad behaviour because they think they won't get help. A survey of 5,200 staff found that almost half think complaints are handled poorly and many feel unsupported. Women are more likely to report than men, and some forces like the Metropolitan Police have the worst record. The police federation will soon launch a support programme for whistle‑blowers."
