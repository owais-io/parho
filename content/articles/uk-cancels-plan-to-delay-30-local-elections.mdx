title: "UK Cancels Plan to Delay 30 Local Elections"
summary: "Earlier this year, UK ministers tried to postpone local elections in 30 councils so the councils could finish a big reorganisation. Legal advice said the move would probably fail in court, so the housing minister reversed the decision. The switch has left councils with just 12 weeks to set up elections, book polling stations and recruit staff, and may cost an extra £63 m in expenses. The move has sparked questions about how the government makes and reverses decisions."
