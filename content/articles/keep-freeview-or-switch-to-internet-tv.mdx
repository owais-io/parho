summary: "Freeview, the free over‑the‑air TV service, still reaches millions of UK homes, but a group of experts and broadcasters argue it should be replaced by internet‑delivered TV by the 2030s.

However, some worry about a two‑tier system, the cost of broadband, and the need for a careful, inclusive rollout."
