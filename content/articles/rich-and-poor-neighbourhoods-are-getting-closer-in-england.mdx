title: "Rich and Poor Neighbourhoods Are Getting Closer in England"
summary: "In Grimsby, a 6‑foot wall separates the poor Nunsthorpe estate from the wealthy Scartho area, turning a quick walk into a 25‑minute trip and sparking crime and isolation. New UK data shows more places where the poorest and richest neighbours live next to each other, especially in the north but also in London and the south. The wall illustrates how short‑term housing plans can split communities, yet local groups keep working together."
