title: "UK’s Biggest Car Factory Gets Ready for Electric Cars"
summary: "Nissan’s Sunderland plant in the UK just finished a £450m makeover to start making the new electric Leaf. Workers and robots fit batteries on a moving line, and the factory can produce up to 600,000 cars a year. But the plant only made 282,000 cars in 2024, and sales are slow. The EU has eased its 2035 petrol‑free rule, and Nissan has said it won’t rush to 100% electric vehicles."
