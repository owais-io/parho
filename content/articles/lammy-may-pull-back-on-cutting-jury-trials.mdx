title: "Lammy May Pull Back on Cutting Jury Trials"
summary: "David Lammy, the UK Justice Secretary, was set to cut jury trials for most cases, keeping them only for the most serious crimes. After hearing cabinet feedback, he may keep jury trials for more offences, using a 3‑year sentence threshold to decide which cases go to magistrates or a new judge‑only court. Lawyers and MPs say the changes could hurt fairness, especially for minority defendants. Lammy says he still supports juries but wants to fix court delays."
