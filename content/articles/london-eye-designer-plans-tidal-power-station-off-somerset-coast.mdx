title: "London Eye designer plans tidal power station off Somerset coast"
summary: "Julia Barfield, the architect behind the London Eye, wants to build a 14‑mile tidal power station off Somerset. The project would use 125 underwater turbines to produce about 2.5 GW, enough to power around two million homes and meet the huge electricity demand from AI and data centers. It would also create a walk‑and‑cycle path, a marina, a lido, and opportunities for local jobs and marine farming, aiming to boost the region’s economy and lower carbon use."
