title: "Weight‑loss drugs work, but most people regain weight quickly after stopping"
summary: "Study shows people lose weight on drugs but regain it fast after stopping. On average, they lost 8.3 kg, then put back 4.8 kg in a year, and reached their old weight in about 1.7 years. Weight comes back almost four times faster than after diet or exercise programmes. The research stresses that drugs are useful but need long‑term support and healthy habits to keep the weight off."
