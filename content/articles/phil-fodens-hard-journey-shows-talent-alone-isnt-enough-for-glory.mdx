summary: "Phil Foden won the Golden Ball at the 2017 Under‑17 World Cup, but his path to England’s senior team has been rocky. He missed several internationals because manager Thomas Tuchel prioritises team balance over star players, and Foden’s best form comes in a system at Manchester City that doesn’t translate easily to the national side. Although he was named Premier League Player of the Season, he still isn’t guaranteed a spot for the World Cup."
