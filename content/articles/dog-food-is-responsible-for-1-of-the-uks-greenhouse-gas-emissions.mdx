title: "Dog food is responsible for 1% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions"
summary: "Researchers found that the food we buy for dogs produces about 1% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions, a significant chunk of the country’s climate impact. Wet, raw and grain‑free brands emit far more than ordinary dry kibble—sometimes up to 65 times higher. The study suggests pet owners can help the planet by choosing lower‑impact kibble and checking labels for meat cuts. Plant‑based options may also cut emissions, but more are needed."
