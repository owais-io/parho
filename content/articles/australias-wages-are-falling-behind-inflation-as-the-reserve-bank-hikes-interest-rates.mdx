title: "Australia’s wages are falling behind inflation as the Reserve Bank hikes interest rates"
summary: "In 2025 Australian workers earned only 3.4% more than last year, while prices rose 3.8%. The Reserve Bank raised rates to curb inflation, arguing that tight labour markets force companies to raise pay, but data shows wages aren’t driving price hikes. Instead, higher profits and strong demand are pushing prices up. Real wages are flat for the next two years, leaving many workers feeling squeezed."
