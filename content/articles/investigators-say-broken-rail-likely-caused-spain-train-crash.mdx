title: "Investigators Say Broken Rail Likely Caused Spain Train Crash"
summary: "A deadly high‑speed train crash near Adamuz, Spain, killed 45 people. Investigators think the train hit a broken section of rail that had fractured just before it passed. The rail’s break made a step that struck the wheel, causing the Iryo train to derail and collide with a Renfe train. The theory is still being tested. The crash follows another derailment in Catalonia and has prompted a train‑drivers strike and political backlash."
