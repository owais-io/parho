title: "12 Homes Lost as 75+ Bushfires Rage in New South Wales"
summary: "Over 75 bushfires were burning across New South Wales, with 19 still uncontrolled. A fire in Koolewong destroyed at least 12 homes and spread to the Woy Woy bay area, prompting emergency warnings and a large firefighting effort. Other big blazes hit Milsons Gully, Goulburn River National Park, and Bulahdelah. In Tasmania, a Dolphin Sands fire damaged homes and power lines, while Victoria’s Markwood fire was contained. Heatwaves and dry, windy conditions kept fire danger high, but a cool wind change is expected to ease the situation."
