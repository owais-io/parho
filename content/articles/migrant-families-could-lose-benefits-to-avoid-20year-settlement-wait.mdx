title: "Migrant Families Could Lose Benefits to Avoid 20‑Year Settlement Wait"
summary: "Government plans would double the settlement wait for migrants who use public benefits, forcing families to stop claiming things like child benefit and universal credit. Over 200,000 people are on a 10‑year path to permanent residency. The new rules would make the wait 20 years for those who have used public funds. NGOs say it will push migrant families into poverty and force them to choose between basic needs and staying in the UK."
