title: "Lords Carefully Review Assisted‑Dying Bill, Not Block It"
summary: "The piece argues that the House of Lords are properly reviewing the assisted‑dying bill, not stalling it. It says the bill ignores suffering, gives the state—not patients—control, and forces doctors to follow strict rules. Critics note the bill is too limited and could favor richer people. The authors welcome the Lords’ detailed debate and say better options should be considered."
