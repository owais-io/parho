title: "CBS Airs 60 Minutes Report on Venezuelan Prisoners in El Salvador"
summary: "After a month of delays, CBS finally showed a 60 Minutes report on Venezuelan men sent to the Cecot prison in El Salvador. The segment was held by editor‑in‑chief Bari Weiss because the network felt it needed more sources and the Trump administration wouldn’t cooperate. The aired version still lacks a government comment, and DHS declined to provide records. The story was previously shown on a Canadian network, so viewers had seen it before the CBS airing."
