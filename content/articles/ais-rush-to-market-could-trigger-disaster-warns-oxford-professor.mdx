title: "AI’s Rush to Market Could Trigger Disaster, Warns Oxford Professor"
summary: "Oxford AI professor Michael Wooldridge says the race to sell new AI tools is a recipe for disaster. Companies want customers fast, so they launch products before fully testing them. He compares this to the 1937 Hindenburg crash, warning that a big AI mistake could shake confidence in technology everywhere—from self‑driving cars to banks. Wooldridge says we need to remember that AI is just a tool, not a human."
