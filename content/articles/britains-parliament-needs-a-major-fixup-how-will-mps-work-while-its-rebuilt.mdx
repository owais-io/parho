title: "Britain’s Parliament Needs a Major Fix‑Up – How Will MPs Work While It’s Rebuilt?"
summary: "Parliament is in serious trouble: asbestos, mice, cramped rooms, and a building that can’t accommodate all 650 MPs. New plans could move lawmakers to the House of Lords or even a full relocation, costing up to £18bn and taking decades. The House of Commons chamber is too small, and the whole complex lacks modern safety and accessibility. A big overhaul is urgent, but how MPs keep working during the rebuild is still being sorted out."
