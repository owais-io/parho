summary: "China’s green‑energy sector—batteries, electric cars, solar and wind—accounted for more than 90% of the country’s investment growth last year, making it one of the world’s biggest economic engines. The surge helped China hit its 5% growth target and could push global carbon emissions lower. While coal projects still loom, the rapid rise of clean energy may soon make solar cheaper than coal in China. The new data comes as China plans its next five‑year energy strategy."
