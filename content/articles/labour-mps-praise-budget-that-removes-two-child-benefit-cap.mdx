title: "Labour MPs Praise Budget That Removes Two-Child Benefit Cap"
summary: "Labour MPs cheered Prime Minister Rachel Reeves’s budget after she removed the cap that stops families with more than two kids from getting extra child benefits. The move will lift about half a million children out of poverty and cost the government £3 billion this term. The budget also raised the minimum wage, added a tax on homes over £2 million, and put a levy on online gambling. Many backbenchers welcomed the changes, though some critics say the tax plan is uneven."
