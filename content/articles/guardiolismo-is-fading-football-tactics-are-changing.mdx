title: "Guardiolismo is fading – football tactics are changing"
summary: "For years, football was all about keeping the ball and controlling space. But now, corners, throw‑ins and set‑pieces are scoring more goals, and teams use data and new tactics to outsmart opponents. Referees have become less strict about contact, and defenders are learning to play the ball instead of just stopping it. Guardiola’s style sparked a change, but the game is moving on to a mix of old and new ideas."
