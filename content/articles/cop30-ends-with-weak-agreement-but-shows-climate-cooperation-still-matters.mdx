title: "COP30 ends with weak agreement but shows climate cooperation still matters"
summary: "COP30, the climate meeting that finished in Brazil last week, ended with a shaky deal. Countries most affected by warming and oil‑heavy nations still clashed over moving away from fossil fuels. Global politics—US energy policy, rising right‑wing populism, and wars in Ukraine and Gaza—made progress hard. Still, the conference proved that nations can work together, even if the final outcome was not a major breakthrough."
