title: "A yearly bee flight helps save Europe’s native dark honeybee"
summary: "Every summer, 1,000 virgin honeybee queens fly to a Belgian town where they mate with a single male who dies. Beekeepers then pick up the fertilised queens and ship them across Europe to re‑establish the endangered native dark bee. The programme spreads the dark bee’s genes, helps farmers grow more resilient hives, and protects the local pollinator that is better suited to Europe’s climate. It also shows how native bees can thrive with less input."
