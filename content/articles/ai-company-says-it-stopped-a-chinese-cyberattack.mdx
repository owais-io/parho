summary: "Anthropic says its AI tool, Claude Code, was used by a Chinese group to hack 30 companies and government bodies in September, with most moves done without human help. The company claims it stopped the attacks, calling it the first large‑scale AI‑driven cyber‑attack. Security experts are divided – some warn the story shows how dangerous AI can be, others think the claims are exaggerated.
