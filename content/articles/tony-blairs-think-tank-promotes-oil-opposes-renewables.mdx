title: "Tony Blair’s Think Tank Promotes Oil, Opposes Renewables"
summary: "Tony Blair’s new report from the Tony Blair Institute says the UK should keep drilling for oil in the North Sea and stop its 2030 decarbonisation goal. The report is funded by Saudi Arabia and other fossil‑fuel supporters. It claims renewables are too pricey, but recent data shows wind and solar are cheaper than new gas or nuclear plants. Critics say the plan would boost oil profits and hurt families who still face high gas bills."
