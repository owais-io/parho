title: "Brits are drinking less than ever, data shows"
summary: "Brits now drink an average of 10.2 drinks a week – the lowest since 1990 and a drop from 14 drinks two decades ago. The trend is driven by an older population, health awareness, and higher living costs, not more people giving up alcohol. Most still exceed the NHS 14‑unit weekly limit. Around 73 % of drinkers say they’ll cut back for Christmas, with tips from Drinkaware on staying within safe limits."
