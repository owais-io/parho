title: "What the Bondi Commission Will Examine and How It Works"
summary: "The prime minister has set up a national inquiry to look into antisemitism and social unity after the Bondi beach shooting that killed 15 people. Former High Court judge Virginia Bell will lead it and focus on four areas: how common antisemitism is, what fuels it, how law‑enforcement can respond, and ways to keep society together. The commission has a year, must report by 14 Dec, and will merge a prior ASIO review. States will help, and only one commission will run, ending the NSW plan. Bell’s legal experience helps keep the investigation fair and separate from the criminal trial."
