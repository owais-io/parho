title: "Wimbledon allowed to keep selling its special debenture tickets despite new UK resale ban"
summary: "Wimbledon's special five‑year “debenture” tickets can still be resold, even after the UK ban that stops tickets being sold for profit. Debenture holders get guaranteed seats on Centre Court or No. 1 Court each day, plus club bar access, and can trade the passes. The exemption lets the organisers keep the money that keeps the venue running and general‑admission prices low. The new rule targets touts and sites like Viagogo and StubHub, but Wimbledon’s program is kept open."
