title: "300+ agriculture lobbyists crowd the UN climate summit in Brazil"
summary: "At this year’s UN climate summit in Brazil, more than 300 lobbyists from the industrial agriculture sector were present. That’s a 14 % jump from last year and more than the Canadian delegation. The group includes cattle‑farm, soy, and pesticide companies that are major drivers of Amazon deforestation and a big part of global emissions. Indigenous leaders say the lobbyists push profits over protecting the forest, while the industry seeks to shape climate rules and biofuel targets."
