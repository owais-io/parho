title: "Mercury Visible Before Sunrise This Week – Easy for Northern Observers"
summary: "Mercury will be easy to spot before sunrise this week. It’s at its farthest point from the Sun, so it appears as far away as possible in the early morning sky. Northern‑hemisphere observers can see it about 30–60 minutes before dawn, even though it’s still low and faint. Those in the Southern Hemisphere need a clear eastern horizon, but it’s much harder to catch. Use binoculars if you can, but avoid looking at the Sun."
