title: "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s Arrest Photo Looks Like Art"
summary: "A photo taken by Reuters photographer Phil Noble shows Andrew Mountbatten‑Windsor leaving a police station, looking shocked and haunted. Critics compare his expression to Edvard Munch’s “The Scream”, suggesting the image reveals guilt and personal horror. The picture is the first time a senior royal has been arrested in modern history, and its raw, unfiltered look challenges the usual polished portraits of royalty. The photo may become a lasting symbol of a more human, troubled monarchy."
