title: "UK Energy Bills to Rise Again in Winter, Affects Millions of Households"
summary: "Ofgem raised the energy price cap in February, adding about £3 to the average annual bill, or roughly 28p a month. The rise is driven by higher government levies, not higher wholesale gas prices. Households that use more electricity than gas will see larger increases—3‑4% higher bills. Despite falling wholesale costs, policy charges are pushing the cap up, and the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT on electricity to help ease the burden."
