title: "Australia’s Wildfires: Animals Are Paying the Price"
summary: "Australia’s summer has seen record heat, huge droughts, and raging fires that have scorched millions of hectares. These blazes have destroyed critical habitats for species like the dibbler, bristlebird, and flying foxes, leaving many animals dying from heat stress or losing homes. Extreme heat also kills aquatic life and triggers deadly algal blooms. The story warns that if we keep approving fossil‑fuel projects and cutting forests, wildlife loss will only grow."
