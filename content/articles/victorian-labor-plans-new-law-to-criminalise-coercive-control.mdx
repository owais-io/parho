title: "Victorian Labor plans new law to criminalise coercive control"
summary: "The Victorian government will make coercive control a separate criminal offence in 2026. The move follows the opposition leader’s pledge to introduce the law if elected. Even though the current laws already treat coercive behaviour as family violence, the government says more protection is needed. The new bill will give clearer penalties, extend protection orders and cover more abuses like stalking. Debate is ongoing, but the law is likely to pass next year."
