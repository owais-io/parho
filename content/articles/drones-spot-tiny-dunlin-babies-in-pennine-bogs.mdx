title: "Drones Spot Tiny Dunlin Babies in Pennine Bogs"
summary: "Drone footage shows tiny dunlin chicks nesting in restored peatland in the Cumbrian Pennines. The RSPB and Natural England used drones to check hard‑to‑reach wetlands, finding 14 sites and confirming breeding in eight, especially on the High Helbeck estate where landowners created 79 hectares of wet peat and new feeding pools. The work shows that fixing drained habitats can bring back one of Britain’s rarest birds, which has lost 20% of its global population."
