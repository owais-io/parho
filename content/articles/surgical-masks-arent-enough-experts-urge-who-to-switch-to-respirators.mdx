title: "Surgical masks aren’t enough – experts urge WHO to switch to respirators"
summary: "A group of doctors and scientists wrote to the WHO saying that the surgical masks used in hospitals do not protect enough against airborne illnesses like COVID‑19. They argue that respirator‑style masks (N95/FFP2/3) should be used whenever health workers see a patient. The change would lower infections and sick leave among staff. The letter has support from many clinicians, but some critics say the evidence is not definitive."
