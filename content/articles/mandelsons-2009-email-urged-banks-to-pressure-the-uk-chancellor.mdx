title: "Mandelson’s 2009 Email Urged Banks to Pressure the UK Chancellor"
summary: "In 2009 Peter Mandelson, then business secretary, emailed Jeffrey Epstein urging JP Morgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon to pressure Chancellor Alistair Darling to drop a proposed bonus‑tax on banks. The email shows how the government was open to bank lobbying even after the financial crisis. The Treasury was furious, but Darling went ahead with the tax. Years later, the new Labour government again avoided a bank windfall tax, showing that banks still hold sway over policy."
