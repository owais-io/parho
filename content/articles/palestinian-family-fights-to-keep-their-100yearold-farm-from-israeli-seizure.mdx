title: "Palestinian family fights to keep their 100‑year‑old farm from Israeli seizure"
summary: "The Nassar family, who own a 42‑hectare farm near Bethlehem, have been fighting Israeli claims that the land is “state land” since 1991. They kept official titles from 1916 through each ruling power. Israeli soldiers and settlers have damaged their olive trees and cut off water and electricity. The family relies on rainwater, volunteers, and solar power, and still lives in caves because building homes is banned."
