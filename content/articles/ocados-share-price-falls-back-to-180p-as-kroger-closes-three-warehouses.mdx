title: "Ocado’s share price falls back to 180p as Kroger closes three warehouses"
summary: "Ocado’s share price has fallen back to its 15‑year‑old level of 180p after a sharp rise during the pandemic. The drop comes after Kroger, the US supermarket chain that had been a key customer, announced it would shut three of its eight Ocado‑powered warehouses and look at other delivery partners. Ocado’s robot‑heavy model is costly, while cheaper pick‑and‑deliver options are proving popular. The company hopes to grow in the US but must show how its pricey tech will win customers."
