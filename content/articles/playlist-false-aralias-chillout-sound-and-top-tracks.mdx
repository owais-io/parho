title: "Playlist: False Aralia’s chillout sound and top tracks"
summary: "False Aralia is a strange record label that releases EPs by one main producer, Izaak Schlossman, with a different guest each time. Every track is just numbered, and the artwork is a simple black‑and‑white doodle. The music blends early‑2000s micro‑house with dub‑techno vibes, featuring warped vocals and quiet beats. The Guardian also highlights this week’s best new tracks from artists like Frances Chang, Robyn, and Peter Gabriel."
