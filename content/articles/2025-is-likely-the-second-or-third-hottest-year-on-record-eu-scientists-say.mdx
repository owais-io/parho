title: "2025 Is Likely the Second- or Third-Hottest Year on Record, EU Scientists Say"
summary: "EU climate scientists say 2025 will almost certainly be the world’s second- or third-hottest year. Data from January to November show temperatures were 1.48°C above pre‑industrial levels, matching 2023, the second hottest year after 2024. November was the third-warmest month ever, with record heat in Canada and the Arctic. This trend shows we’re not on track to keep global warming below 1.5°C, despite efforts to cut emissions."
