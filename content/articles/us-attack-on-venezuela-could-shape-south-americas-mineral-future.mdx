title: "U.S. Attack on Venezuela Could Shape South America’s Mineral Future"
summary: "The U.S. recently used naval forces against Venezuela, which could change how South America’s huge mineral resources are used. Washington wants to secure oil and critical minerals for its military and industry, while China has been buying most of these materials. The move threatens the region’s shift toward renewable energy and could push the continent into U.S. control. Leaders in Brazil, Colombia, and others have mixed reactions—some welcome the support, others worry about U.S. interference and environmental harm."
