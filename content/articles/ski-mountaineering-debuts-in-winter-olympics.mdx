title: "Ski Mountaineering Debuts in Winter Olympics"
summary: "Ski mountaineering, or skimo, has joined the Winter Olympics in Milan‑Cortina 2026. Athletes climb mountains on lightweight gear, switch from skins that let them walk uphill to ski boots that let them descend fast. Two events – sprint and mixed relay – will be run in Bormio on February 19. The sport is fast, tech‑heavy and needs little infrastructure, making it a good fit as climate change limits snow. French and Italian teams are favorites."
