title: "Hong Kong Handles Fire Tragedy Differently from Beijing"
summary: "After a fire that killed 151 people in Hong Kong, the government set up an independent inquiry, a move China would never allow. The tragedy shows how Hong Kong’s legal system remains separate but is being eroded by security laws. Police have arrested 13 people, and no official has taken responsibility yet. The incident will be part of this year’s “patriots‑only” LegCo elections, where turnout is expected to be very low."
