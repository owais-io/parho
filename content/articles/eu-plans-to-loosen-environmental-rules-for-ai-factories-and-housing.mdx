title: "EU plans to loosen environmental rules for AI factories and housing"
summary: "The EU wants to let big projects like AI data‑center factories and affordable homes skip lengthy environmental checks. It also plans to drop rules on dangerous chemicals, local reps for polluters, and strict farm environmental systems. Brussels says this could save companies about €1 billion a year, but green groups warn it could harm nature and people’s health. The proposal comes as the EU is also tightening some climate rules and easing corporate sustainability laws."
