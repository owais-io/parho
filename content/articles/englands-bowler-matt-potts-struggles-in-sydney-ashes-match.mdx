title: "England’s bowler Matt Potts struggles in Sydney Ashes match"
summary: "England's Matt Potts faced a tough Ashes game in Sydney, bowling poorly as Travis Head racked up runs. The 29‑average bowler was used to fill gaps after injuries and lacked recent match practice. England's attack struggled with control and dropped catches, while the team's focus on batting meant the bowlers were underprepared. Despite the low score, Potts did his best in a disappointing session."
