title: "CDC removes rule that all newborns must get hepatitis B shot"
summary: "The CDC has dropped its 30‑year rule that every baby must get a hepatitis B shot at birth. Now the shot is only for babies whose mothers have hepatitis B or whose status is unknown. Parents can ask doctors to decide; if they skip the birth dose, the first shot can wait until the baby is at least two months old. Experts warn this could raise infections and make vaccination harder."
