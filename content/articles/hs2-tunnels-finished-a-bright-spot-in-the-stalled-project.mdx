title: "HS2 tunnels finished – a bright spot in the stalled project"
summary: "HS2’s long‑delayed tunnels in the Chilterns are now finished. Built to keep the line out of a protected landscape, the 10‑mile tunnels are neat concrete tubes ready for a train. Two German tunnelling machines worked round the clock for almost three years, and the work also built a big viaduct nearby. The project still faces huge cost overruns, but new boss Mark Wild is pushing for a faster, cheaper rebuild."
