title: "Book a UK Holiday Package and Pay with Credit Card for Extra Safety"
summary: "Many Brits want a sunny break despite higher living costs, so they’re looking at ways to stay safe when booking. Choosing a UK‑based package gives you Atol protection against missing flights, hotels or a company going bust. Pay with a credit card for Section 75 coverage, avoid buy‑now‑pay‑later where you lose that safety net, and buy insurance right away. Booking in January may be cheaper, but wait‑list risk is higher."
