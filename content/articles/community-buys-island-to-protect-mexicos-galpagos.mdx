title: "Community Buys Island to Protect Mexico’s “Galápagos”"
summary: "In the Sea of Cortez, the island of Espíritu Santo—called Mexico’s Galápagos—is a wildlife hotspot. In the 1990s, developers wanted to turn it into a casino, but a group of activists and billionaire Manuel Arango raised money to buy the island from local owners for about $3 million. It was declared federal land, then a UNESCO site and national park. Today, tourists, fishing and climate change threaten its ecology, so locals and officials are fighting to keep it protected."
