title: "Bruce Lehrmann Files Final Appeal After Court Says He Raped Brittany Higgins"
summary: "Bruce Lehrmann is trying one last time to get the court to reverse a decision that found he raped former staffer Brittany Higgins in Parliament House in 2019. He argues the judge used private research that shouldn’t have been considered, saying the court’s verdict was biased. The case has already sparked criminal and defamation trials, and the federal court has rejected his earlier appeal. Now he hopes the High Court will throw the findings out."
