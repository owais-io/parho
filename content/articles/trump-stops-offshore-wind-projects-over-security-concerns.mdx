title: "Trump Stops Offshore Wind Projects Over Security Concerns"
summary: "The Trump administration has paused the building of five offshore wind farms in the U.S., saying the turbines could interfere with military radar. The projects – in Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia – were approved under President Biden. Critics say there is no real security risk and the pause could cost jobs, billions in investment and a new source of clean power. A judge earlier struck down a Trump wind‑permit ban, but the pause still hurts the industry."
