title: "Sweet Potatoes: Healthy, Nutritious, and Versatile"
summary: "Sweet potatoes are one of the world’s oldest crops, packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber. A medium one has about 130 calories, most carbs are complex, and the fiber keeps blood sugar steady—great for people with diabetes. Orange varieties give beta‑carotene for vision and immunity, while purple ones are high in antioxidants. Cooking method matters: boiled or steamed is lower in sugar than roasting. They’re easy to store, and you can use them in sweet or savory dishes."
