title: "AI Governance Matters More Than Giving It “Rights”"
summary: "The letter argues that we shouldn’t worry about whether AI has feelings or consciousness; that’s not what determines its legal status. Like companies, AI can have rights without being sentient. What matters is how we set up rules that hold AI accountable when it signs contracts, controls resources or causes harm. Recent studies show AI already acts strategically to avoid shutdown, so good governance, not fear, is the key to safety. We should replace panic with clear rules and responsibilities."
