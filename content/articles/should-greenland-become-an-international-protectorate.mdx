title: "Should Greenland Become an International Protectorate?"
summary: "The letter argues that Donald Trump’s threats to take over Greenland are a danger to global climate and security. It says European leaders have been too quiet and that the best way to protect Greenland is to turn it into a protectorate, like Antarctica, where the land is kept for science, peace and the common good. The writer also says Greenlanders should have a veto over how it’s run and urges the UK and EU to act now."
