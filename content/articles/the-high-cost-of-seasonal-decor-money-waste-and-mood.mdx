summary: "People are changing lights, rugs and other decor every season, driven by marketing and social media. In the UK, 70 million items are thrown away each year, and 62% of Britons simply dump their homeware when it feels outdated. The trend promises happiness, but studies show that buying new decor rarely improves wellbeing and actually encourages overconsumption. Experts suggest keeping a few consistent items and using cheaper ways to boost mood, like music or volunteering."
