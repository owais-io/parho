title: "US Storms Driven by Atmospheric Rivers"
summary: "California had evacuation warnings as an “atmospheric river” – a long tube of moist air from the Pacific – dumped heavy rain, risking floods and landslides. Similar storms hit the US, while Colorado got very warm and almost no snow, pushing ski resorts to delay opening. In Australia, thunderstorms knocked out power for 11,000 homes and sparked bushfires. Japan saw record‑early heavy snow, and Italy suffered mudslides that killed two people and flooded towns."
