title: "Florida workers with criminal records stuck in low‑pay temp jobs"
summary: "Florida’s prison‑to‑work gap: After release, many ex‑prisoners must work in temp agencies that pay less and offer no benefits. A new report shows over 70% of South Florida ex‑prisoners turn to temp jobs within three years, often earning $6–$13 less a year than permanent staff. These jobs keep wages low and block full‑time opportunities. The study calls for stricter rules on temp agencies, better training, and protections for workers."
