title: "Trump’s Threat to Greenland Shows the US Is an Unreliable Ally"
summary: "Trump threatened to seize Greenland, but Europe united and pushed him back. The episode shows the US is an unpredictable ally, raising doubts about its promises. The piece argues that Europe and other democracies must form a new, stronger partnership that can defend itself without depending on Washington. It calls for higher defence budgets, closer EU‑UK ties, and a fresh alliance among western democracies."
