title: "Local Elections May Be Postponed Again as Councils Struggle to Merge"
summary: "Opposition parties say Labour is scared of voters. Local elections in the UK could be pushed back again because many councils are still trying to merge into single‑unit bodies. The government says some councils lack the time and resources to reorganise and run elections for bodies that will soon be abolished. Seventy‑three councils could decide to delay until 2026‑27, while new mayor elections are set for 2028. Ministers say they will listen to local leaders before any final decision."
