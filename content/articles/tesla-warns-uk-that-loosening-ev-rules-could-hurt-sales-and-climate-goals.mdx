title: "Tesla warns UK that loosening EV rules could hurt sales and climate goals"
summary: "Tesla has told the UK government that easing electric‑car rules would lower sales, risk missing climate targets, and hurt the country’s carbon budget. The company also wants help for used electric cars. Other makers, like BMW, Nissan and Toyota, say the rules hurt their profits, while environmental groups back them. New taxes and a future “pay‑per‑mile” charge could make electric cars less appealing. Tesla also wants a ban on some small‑range plug‑in hybrids after 2030."
