title: "Labour’s Party System Is Out of Touch"
summary: "Chris Powell says Labour needs a permanent local network to listen and act on neighbourhood problems, like the old Community Organising Unit that was shut under Starmer. Critics say the party now treats volunteers as mere canvassers and ignores local concerns, even threatening councillors who raise them. They warn that Labour’s focus on PR has turned it into a front for the right. Others say the party must ditch “populism” talk and offer a real left‑wing plan for equality and jobs."
