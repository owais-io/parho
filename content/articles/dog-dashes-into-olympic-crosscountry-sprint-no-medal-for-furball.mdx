title: "Dog Dashes into Olympic Cross‑Country Sprint, No Medal for Furball"
summary: "A dog named Nazgul, living near a hotel in Tesero, burst onto the women’s cross‑country sprint at the Winter Olympics, chasing the finish line. The 2‑year‑old wolf‑dog sprinted past the leader but couldn’t finish because he’s a male dog, not a human. Race officials removed him safely, and the athlete said it was a harmless incident that wouldn’t affect the competition."
