title: "England and Wales Water Firms to Raise Bills for £104bn of Pipe Repairs"
summary: "Water companies in England and Wales can raise bills by about 36% over the next five years to pay for £104 bn of pipe and treatment upgrades – the biggest spend in their history. Labour will replace Ofwat with a new regulator that will look at each company separately. The money will fix leaks, stop sewage spills and boost treatment plants, but critics say households are paying too much. Contractor shortages could slow the work."
