title: "Gen Z Drives Rise in UK Nicotine Pouch Use"
summary: "In the UK, over half a million people now use nicotine pouches, and the jump is mostly among Gen Z. These small, flavored pouches sit between the lip and gum, slowly releasing nicotine. From just 0.1% of adults in 2020 to about 1% in 2025, use has spiked especially among teens and young men. Experts blame heavy social‑media ads and public‑transport billboards, and say tougher age‑limits and advertising rules are needed."
