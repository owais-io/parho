title: "SaaS stocks tumble as AI threatens software business model"
summary: "AI tools like ChatGPT are making many software‑as‑a‑service (SaaS) apps look redundant, so investors are selling off big names such as Xero, WiseTech and Atlassian. Shares have dropped 15‑25% in 2026, wiping billions from founders. Experts say some companies can survive if they hold unique data or hard‑to‑copy systems, but others risk losing revenue as AI replaces the per‑seat model. The market is still figuring out how to price SaaS in an AI world."
