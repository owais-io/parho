title: "Carlsen Wins Freestyle Tour Despite Losing Final Match"
summary: "Carlsen takes the 2025 Freestyle Tour crown after a 0.5‑1.5 loss to Levon Aronian in the Cape Town final. Freestyle, also called Chess960, randomises the back‑row pieces so openings are unpredictable. The Norwegian had already won two of the five events and only needed a fourth‑place finish in the final round to lock the title. Despite a shaky start and a tough blitz tiebreak, he proved his strength and kept the overall lead."
