title: "Miliband stops new North Sea drilling, keeps some projects going"
summary: "Labour leader Ed Miliband says the UK will stop granting new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration. Existing projects can keep going if they link to fields already in use. The move is meant to protect jobs in the North Sea while the country moves toward cleaner energy. Industry groups fear the windfall tax will hurt investment and job growth, while Greenpeace says workers need stronger support for a clean‑energy transition."
