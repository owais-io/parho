title: "Red Jellyfish Swarm Hits Melbourne Beaches"
summary: "A huge cloud of red lion’s‑mane jellyfish has flooded Melbourne’s Port Phillip Bay, leaving thousands in shallow waters and on the sand. Swimmers are told not to enter if they see jellyfish, as stings can be painful or dangerous, especially for children, the elderly and those with allergies. Scientists say the bloom is linked to warmer water and onshore winds, not a climate disaster. Jellyfish are part of the food web and should fade in a few days."
