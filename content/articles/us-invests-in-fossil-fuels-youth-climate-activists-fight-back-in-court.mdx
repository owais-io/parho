title: "US Invests in Fossil Fuels, Youth Climate Activists Fight Back in Court"
summary: "Rikki Held, a 24‑year‑old from Montana, and 16 other young people won a landmark court case (Held v Montana) that says the state can’t help the fossil‑fuel industry because it harms their rights. Though the state Supreme Court upheld the ruling, new laws appear to break it, so the youth are now asking the court to enforce their win. They also sued the federal government and some states, saying courts are the only way to shape climate policy."
