title: "Amazon Could Put $10 B into OpenAI, the Company Behind ChatGPT"
summary: "Amazon is discussing a possible $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the firm that built ChatGPT. If it happens, OpenAI’s value could climb past $500 billion. The money would help OpenAI pay for the huge cloud‑computing costs it’s already paying to Amazon Web Services, and it would give Amazon a stake in the AI lab. OpenAI is also looking at an IPO and has big plans for more data‑centre space."
