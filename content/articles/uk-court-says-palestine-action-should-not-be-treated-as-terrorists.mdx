title: "UK Court Says Palestine Action Should Not Be Treated as Terrorists"
summary: "A UK high court has declared that labeling the protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation was unlawful. The ruling means the government cannot put the group on the same list as al‑Qaida or ISIS, and that activists could not face up to 14 years in prison for supporting it. The decision follows the government’s ban that led to 2,700 arrests during Gaza protests. Critics say the court protects free speech and shows the UK is wrongly suppressing dissent about Israel’s actions in Gaza."
