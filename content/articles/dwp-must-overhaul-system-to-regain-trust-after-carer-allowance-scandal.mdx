title: "DWP Must Overhaul System to Regain Trust After Carer Allowance Scandal"
summary: "The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) has been told to change its culture and way of working after a review showed that a confusing system let unpaid carers owe huge debts and some faced mental health problems or even legal trouble. The review, led by Prof. Liz Sayce, found that the department’s own lack of curiosity and a defensive attitude were to blame. The government has begun reviewing 200,000 cases and will try to cancel or reduce debts."
