title: "The Aussie heat is brutal. The sun beats down, and the air feels like a dryer. In Adelaide it reached 40 °C (104 °F). That’s hot enough that players get tired just by standing, and it can hurt them."
summary: "**Why it matters** 1. **Players get tired** – Their hearts work hard, and sweat builds up.   2. **Batsmen lose focus** – The bowlers use that heat to keep the ball on the right line.   3. **England can’t keep the Bazball style** – Their aggressive batting didn’t work against Australia’s accurate bowlers. **What’s happening in the series** * England is down 3–0 after losing the second Test at Adelaide.   * They scored 213 for 8 from 68 overs, still 158 runs behind the target.   * Australia’s bowlers are hitting every line and length, pulling out every little movement. **Take‑away** The heat is dangerous. It hurts the players’ health and slows England’s batting. Australia is making the best of the conditions, and England is struggling to play their attacking style. The series has turned into a one‑way game, and it shows that the Bazball approach can’t beat a hot, hostile Australian pitch and accurate bowling."
