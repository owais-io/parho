title: "Use the Moon’s Jules Verne Crater as a New Spacecraft Graveyard"
summary: "A proposal suggests turning the Jules Verne crater on the far side of the moon into a dumping ground for old spacecraft, similar to how the ocean’s Point Nemo is used to crash space junk. Scientists think it could be a quiet, safe place for decommissioned satellites and rockets. The idea is part of growing efforts to manage space debris and keep the moon and Earth clean."
