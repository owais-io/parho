title: "US launches portal that lets Europeans see content blocked by their own governments"
summary: "The US has created a site called “freedom.gov” that lets people in Europe bypass local laws that block certain posts, including hate speech and other illegal content. The portal is run by a US government agency and is seen as a political move that could let users access banned material instead of using open‑source privacy tools. It adds to tensions between the US and the EU over tech regulation."
