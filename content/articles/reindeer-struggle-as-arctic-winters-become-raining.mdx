title: "Reindeer Struggle as Arctic Winters Become Raining"
summary: "Reindeer have trouble getting to their food when the Arctic winter rains, because the rain turns the snow into ice that blocks their hooves. Studies of weather records and herd births in Norway and Finland show that more rain‑on‑snow winters mean lower birth rates the following summer. The problem is getting worse, happening earlier and across more interior regions, and it hits places with heavy reindeer populations hardest. The research could help herders find safer winter pastures."
