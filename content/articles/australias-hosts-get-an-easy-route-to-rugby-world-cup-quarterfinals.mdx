title: "Australia’s hosts get an easy route to Rugby World Cup quarter‑finals"
summary: "The 2027 Rugby World Cup draw, held in Sydney, gives Australia a clear path to the quarter‑finals as the host nation. Australia is already in Group A and will face one of the top six teams (South Africa, New Zealand, England, Ireland, France or Argentina). The other two group opponents will come from emerging rugby nations. The draw also decides venues, with some uncertainty around matches in Melbourne due to an NFL‑Melbourne deal."
