title: "32 Fossil‑Fuel Companies Produce Half of Global CO₂ Emissions"
summary: "A new study shows that just 32 fossil‑fuel companies produce half of the world's carbon dioxide in 2024, down from 36 a year earlier. Saudi Aramco tops the list, followed by ExxonMobil. Most of the biggest polluters are state‑owned, from countries that opposed a global phase‑out at the COP30 climate summit. Emissions must fall 45 % by 2030 to meet Paris goals, but the concentrated group is still growing. The data is being used in court cases and to push for accountability."
