title: "Bank of England Holds Rates at 3.75%, Says Inflation Will Drop"
summary: "Bank of England left interest rates at 3.75% and said inflation should drop to about 2% by spring thanks to budget cuts on utilities and rail fares. The nine‑member committee split 5‑4, hinting at future cuts. Growth is seen as weaker and unemployment slightly higher. Markets think there's a 50‑50 chance of a cut at the next meeting. The decision keeps borrowing costs steady for now."
