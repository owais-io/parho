title: "Worker’s family still waiting a year for compensation after death at Saudi World Cup construction site"
summary: "Mohammad Arshad, a Pakistani migrant worker, fell to his death on a construction platform at Saudi Arabia’s Aramco Stadium in March 2025. His family is still unpaid a year later, despite Besix and Saudi law promising compensation of up to £63,250 plus his salary and end‑of‑service benefits. Only a small donation has reached them. Human‑rights groups say this shows the long, difficult process families face to get what they’re legally owed."
