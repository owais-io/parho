title: "Canada’s new law could make it harder for refugees to stay"
summary: "Canada’s new Bill C-12, passed in December, makes it harder for people to ask for asylum. If you wait more than a year after arriving, the claim goes to a single officer who often says no. Claims made at the U.S. border after 14 days also skip the usual board review. The law has already helped Canada deport 18,000 people in 2024, costing $78 million. Critics say it looks like U.S. border rules and hurts refugees’ rights."
