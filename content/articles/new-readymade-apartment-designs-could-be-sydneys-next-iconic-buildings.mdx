title: "New Ready‑Made Apartment Designs Could Be Sydney’s Next Iconic Buildings"
summary: "The NSW government has released nine ready‑made designs for three‑to‑six‑storey apartments. They want builders to use them to create 112,000 new homes in Sydney’s suburbs over five years. The plans cost about $1,500–$2,500 for the first six months – just a fraction of a custom design – and can be bought from architects in Australia and New Zealand. The government says the templates will speed up approvals and help keep buildings in line with the city’s look."
