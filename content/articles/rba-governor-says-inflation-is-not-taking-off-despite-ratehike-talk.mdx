summary: "Australia’s Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, said inflation isn’t accelerating again, even though January’s data shows prices stayed high at 3.8%. The jump mainly came from ending electricity rebates, which pushed power bills up 19%. Core inflation rose slightly to 3.4%. Bullock urged patience before more rate hikes, but traders now expect moves in May and possibly August, keeping markets nervous."
