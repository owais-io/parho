title: "UK residents protest 'creepy' billboards that record their reactions"
summary: "Digital billboards with cameras have been set up in hundreds of apartment buildings across the UK. The screens can record how residents look at ads, a feature that many residents and civil‑rights groups find invasive. People are paying for the cameras in their monthly service fees, and there is no way to opt out. While the companies say the billboards improve communication and give advertisers useful data, most residents feel uncomfortable and some buildings have had the screens removed."
