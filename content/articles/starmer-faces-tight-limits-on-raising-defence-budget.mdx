title: "Starmer Faces Tight Limits on Raising Defence Budget"
summary: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants to boost Britain’s defence spending by up to £14 bn a year, targeting 3 % of GDP by 2029. But the Treasury has set borrowing limits and the Office for Budget Responsibility says it would cost 13–17 bn a year. Other departments, like health and social care, are also in line for cuts, so extra money is hard to find. Starmer could raise taxes, but that would hit voters. The government will decide at the March spring statement."
