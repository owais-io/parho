title: "Health experts say NHS chief’s mask advice for flu patients is confusing"
summary: "An NHS leader said anyone with flu‑like coughing or sneezing must wear a mask in public. Health experts warned this could confuse people, because the UK health agency only recommends masks. They said mixed messages hurt trust and could even affect vaccine confidence. Hospitals are already asking staff, patients and visitors to wear masks in busy wards. The NHS chief’s strong word “must” clashes with the softer government advice."
