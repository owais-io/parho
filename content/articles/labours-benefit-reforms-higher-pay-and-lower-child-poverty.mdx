title: "Labour’s Benefit Reforms: Higher Pay and Lower Child Poverty"
summary: "Labour’s new benefit rules aim to lift families out of poverty. The government will raise the standard Universal Credit payment each year for the next four years, a first since the 1970s. It also scrapped the two‑child limit, which should help 450,000 children stay out of poverty and give free school meals to another 100,000. The changes target child poverty, disability payments and quick access to benefits, while keeping overall spending steady."
