title: "First‑time buyers have the best chance to buy a home in 10 years"
summary: "Halifax’s latest data shows first‑time buyers are in the strongest position to buy a house in a decade. House prices hit a record £299,892, but when compared with incomes, affordability is highest since 2015. Mortgage costs are lowest in about three years, even with a 4.85% two‑year fixed rate. Prices grew only 0.7% this year, and most regions are stable or rising, so buyers can still find good deals."
