title: "Newborns Can Sense Rhythm in Music, Study Finds"
summary: "Scientists tested 49 sleeping babies with earphones while playing Bach tunes. The babies’ brain waves matched surprises in the rhythm, but not the melody. This shows newborns can predict rhythmic patterns before hearing music. The study suggests rhythm is an innate part of our biology, while melody develops through learning after birth. It helps explain why beats feel universal but tunes differ across cultures."
