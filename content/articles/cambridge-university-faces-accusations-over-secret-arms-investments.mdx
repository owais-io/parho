title: "Cambridge University Faces Accusations Over Secret Arms Investments"
summary: "Cambridge University is under fire for keeping its £4bn endowment fund a secret, especially after it turns up in the defence sector. Students and staff say the university won’t reveal which arms companies it holds a small stake in, around 1.7% of the fund, raising ethical questions. A working group wants full transparency or a limit on arms holdings, while some professors argue the money is fine because it helps national security. The council will decide next week."
