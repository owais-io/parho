title: "Busway plan would destroy historic orchard, inquiry says"
summary: "Planning a £160 million busway that would link Cambourne to Cambridge, the route would cut through Coton Orchard – a 24‑ha orchard with century‑old trees, rare insects and birds. A public inquiry is looking at the proposal until 21 November. Over 24,000 residents and local councils argue the orchard is irreplaceable and want buses to stay on roads. The planners say the busway is needed for new homes and traffic relief, but environmental groups warn it would cause permanent ecological loss."
