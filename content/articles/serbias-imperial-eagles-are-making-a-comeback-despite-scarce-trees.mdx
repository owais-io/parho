title: "Serbia’s Imperial Eagles Are Making a Comeback Despite Scarce Trees"
summary: "Serbia’s imperial eagles, once almost extinct, are slowly coming back. Farmers cut trees and used poison to kill predators, which hurt the eagles' food and nesting spots. Bird‑watchers and volunteers from the Bird Protection Society now patrol the fields, guard nests, and build new homes. EU projects and local pride have stopped many people from shooting or poisoning eagles, and new pairs are now nesting in northern Serbia. Still, trees, poison, power lines, and wind farms keep the species vulnerable."
