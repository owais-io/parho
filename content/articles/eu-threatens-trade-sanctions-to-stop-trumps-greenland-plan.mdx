title: "EU Threatens Trade Sanctions to Stop Trump’s Greenland Plan"
summary: "The European Union used trade threats to stop U.S. President Donald Trump from trying to annex Greenland. Trump had warned he would impose tariffs on countries blocking his plan, but the EU’s warning of a $93 billion hit made markets nervous, so Trump backed down. The move shows Europe can use its economic power to influence Washington, but also highlights split opinions among European leaders about relying on the U.S."
