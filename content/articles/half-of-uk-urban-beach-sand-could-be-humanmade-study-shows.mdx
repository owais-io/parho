title: "Half of UK Urban Beach Sand Could Be Human‑Made, Study Shows"
summary: "A study of six beaches on Scotland’s Firth of Forth found that up to half of the coarse sand and gravel could be human‑made, like bricks, concrete, glass, and waste. Storms have carried more of these materials onto the coast. Even ‘Thames potatoes’—bricks that have rounded over time—are common. On average, 22 % of the sand is anthropogenic, prompting researchers to call for a new classification and more research on coastal management."
