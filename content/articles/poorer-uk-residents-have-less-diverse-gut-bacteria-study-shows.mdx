title: "Poorer UK residents have less diverse gut bacteria, study shows"
summary: "A study of 1,390 female twins in the UK found that people living in the country’s poorest areas carry fewer types of gut bacteria than wealthier residents. The research linked lower bacterial diversity to higher rates of anxiety, diabetes and other health problems. Scientists say the gut microbiome could be a biological bridge between social deprivation and poorer physical and mental health, pointing to new ways to help disadvantaged communities."
