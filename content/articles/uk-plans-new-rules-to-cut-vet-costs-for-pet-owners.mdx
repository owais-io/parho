title: "UK plans new rules to cut vet costs for pet owners"
summary: "UK ministers will roll out new rules to make vet bills easier to understand and cheaper. Vets will have to post clear price lists for common treatments, show who owns the practice, and give owners a better way to compare costs. The changes follow a Competition and Markets Authority probe that found vet prices were rising faster than inflation, potentially costing households £1bn over five years. Pet owners should soon be able to shop around and save money."
