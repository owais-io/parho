title: "Toxic \"Forever Chemical\" Found in European Cereals, Study Says"
summary: "Researchers in Europe found a dangerous chemical called TFA—made from pesticide leftovers—in most breakfast cereals and other grains. The study looked at 65 common foods in 16 countries and found TFA in 81 % of samples, with levels 100 times higher than tap water. TFA can harm fertility, the thyroid and the immune system. Scientists urge governments to ban the pesticide chemicals that produce it and set stricter limits."
