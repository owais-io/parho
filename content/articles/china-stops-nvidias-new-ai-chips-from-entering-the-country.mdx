title: "China stops Nvidia’s new AI chips from entering the country"
summary: "China has blocked the entry of Nvidia’s H200 AI chips, even though the U.S. government cleared them for export. The move has halted shipments from suppliers who were ready to ship thousands of units. Chinese officials warned local tech firms to avoid buying the chips unless absolutely necessary, but they haven’t said if it’s a permanent ban. The decision highlights the tension between U.S. tech exports and China’s push to develop its own chips."
