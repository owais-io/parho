title: "The Airport Lounge Experience Was a Disappointment"
summary: "The author imagined airport lounges as plush, luxury spots with champagne and private seats, but reality was far worse. She tried a Priority Pass lounge and found a cheap, cramped room with worn leather chairs, stale snacks, and long lines of annoyed passengers. Even the best lounges offer little more than a thin plastic chair and a small can of soda. The experience made her regret the “jet‑set” fantasy and prefer the plain terminal."
