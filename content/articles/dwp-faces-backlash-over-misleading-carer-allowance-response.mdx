title: "DWP Faces Backlash Over Misleading Carer Allowance Response"
summary: "Carers who help a loved one for more than 35 hours a week get £83.30 a week, but if they earn 1p over the limit they must repay the whole amount. Many were unaware and built huge debts, some criminalised. A government review said the system was a “systemic failure” and gave 40 fixes, but the DWP accepted only a few. A senior official blamed carers, sparking outrage from charities and experts who demand an apology and debt cancellations."
