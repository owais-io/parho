title: "Labour’s Special Needs Reforms Could Backfire"
summary: "The Labour government is set to publish a new white paper on special educational needs (SEND). The plan aims to put more SEND children into mainstream schools, give all teachers training, and spend £3.7bn on new facilities. But only £200m is earmarked for training, and there are no promises to raise teacher‑assistant pay or hire more therapists. Critics fear the move will cut legal rights, reduce tribunals, and leave parents with fewer options."
