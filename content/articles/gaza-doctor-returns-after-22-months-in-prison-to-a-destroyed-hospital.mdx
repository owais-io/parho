title: "Gaza Doctor Returns After 22 Months in Prison to a Destroyed Hospital"
summary: "After 22 months in Israeli prisons, Dr Ahmed Muhanna returned to Gaza to find his hospital and city in ruins. He says al‑Awda has almost no staff, medicine or machines like MRIs or dialysis. He lost 75 colleagues and is part of a broader tragedy: more than 1,200 Palestinian health workers have been killed or detained. Despite a ceasefire, food shortages and blocked aid keep people dying. He feels hopeless for his children, but keeps treating patients."
