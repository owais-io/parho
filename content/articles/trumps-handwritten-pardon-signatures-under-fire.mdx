title: "Trump’s Handwritten Pardon Signatures Under Fire"
summary: "The Justice Department has updated the website to show different signatures on Trump‑issued pardons after critics noticed they looked almost identical. Trump says he signed each pardon by hand, blaming a technical glitch and staffing problems for the mix‑up. The pardons were given to people like former Mets star Darryl Strawberry, Tennessee speaker Glen Casada and former police sergeant Michael McMahon. The episode adds to a broader debate over presidents using an autopen versus a personal signature."
