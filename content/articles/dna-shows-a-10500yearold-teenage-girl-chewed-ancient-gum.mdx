title: "DNA shows a 10,500‑year‑old teenage girl chewed ancient gum"
summary: "Archaeologists in Estonia found a piece of ancient gum chewed by a teenage girl 10,500 years ago. DNA from her saliva revealed she likely had brown hair and brown eyes. The gum, made from birch bark, was used for medicine and glue, even today. This discovery shows early people chewed tar for tooth pain and challenges the idea that northern Europeans always had blond hair and blue eyes."
