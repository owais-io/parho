title: "Trump Says US Oil Companies Will Rebuild Venezuela, But Firms Stay Silent"
summary: "President Trump told reporters that big U.S. oil firms would spend billions to rebuild Venezuela’s oil sector after the ousting of Nicolás Maduro. Chevron said it would simply obey Venezuelan law. Exxon, Conoco and others said nothing yet, noting it’s too early to comment. Analysts say the companies may already be consulted, but Venezuela’s damaged infrastructure and an ongoing U.S. embargo make large investment risky. Prices are falling, so firms will be picky about where they invest."
