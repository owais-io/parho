title: "US Demands Five Years of Social Media from Visa‑Free Visitors"
summary: "The Trump administration has announced that visitors from the 42 countries that normally enter United States without a visa will now need to share five years of their social‑media posts, phone numbers, email addresses, and even biometric data when applying for ESTA. The move is meant to stop people with “anti‑American” views from entering, but critics say it could scare tourists and hurt events like next year’s World Cup. Many argue it violates free speech and will damage U.S. tourism."
