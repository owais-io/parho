title: "European Supermarket Plastics Aren’t Really Green"
summary: "European supermarkets sell food wrapped in plastic that brands call “recycled” or “circular.” In reality, most of the plastic is made from oil, not waste, and the small amount that is recycled is mixed with new petroleum in a process called pyrolysis. Companies use accounting tricks, like mass‑balance bookkeeping and avoided‑emissions claims, to make the packaging look greener. EU rules set to tighten this practice next year, but oil giants are lobbying to keep the loophole."
