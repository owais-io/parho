title: "Starmer Meets Xi to Boost UK‑China Trade and Talk Human Rights"
summary: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer flew to Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping. He wants to make trading easier and bring stability to UK‑China ties, which have been shaky in the past. Starmer will also raise human‑rights concerns, such as Hong Kong’s Jimmy Lai, while keeping an eye on national security. Some UK politicians worry China could influence the UK too much, but Starmer says he will set “guardrails” to protect against spying and cyber‑attacks."
