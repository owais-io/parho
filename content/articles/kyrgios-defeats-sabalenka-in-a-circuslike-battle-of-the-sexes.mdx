title: "Kyrgios defeats Sabalenka in a circus‑like Battle of the Sexes"
summary: "Australian Nick Kyrgios beat Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka 6‑3 6‑3 in Dubai’s latest Battle of the Sexes. The match used odd rules – each side got only one serve and the court was slightly smaller – which helped Kyrgios, whose powerful serves and groundstrokes took advantage. The event felt more like a circus, with music, celebrity entrances and a Macarena break. Fans and experts were split: some liked the showmanship, others said it stole focus from real tennis."
