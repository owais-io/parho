title: "Europeans Avoid US Trips, Prefer Emirates and Asia, Says Tui"
summary: "Europe’s biggest travel operator Tui says fewer customers are booking trips to the US. Instead, more people want to fly to the Emirates, Asia, and even the Caribbean. The drop in US bookings is blamed on worries about Trump‑era border rules and ICE detentions. Despite this, Tui’s first‑quarter profit jumped, helped by a big cruise boom. Hotels lagged after a Jamaican hurricane, but the company’s shares rose slightly."
