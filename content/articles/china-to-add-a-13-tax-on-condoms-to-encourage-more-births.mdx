title: "China to Add a 13% Tax on Condoms to Encourage More Births"
summary: "China will start charging a 13% value‑added tax on condoms and other contraceptives from January 1, a move aimed at boosting its falling birthrate and modernising its tax system. The tax, part of a larger effort that includes IVF discounts, child subsidies and free maternity insurance, has drawn ridicule online. Experts say the measure is symbolic and unlikely to change people’s family plans, but it signals the government’s push for more babies."
