title: "Three‑metre oarfish washes up on Tasmanian beach"
summary: "A 3‑metre oarfish washed up on Preservation Bay beach in Tasmania. Local Tony Cheesman saw the bright, ribbon‑like fish while walking his dogs. Oarfish live deep underwater and usually surface when ill. Japanese folklore once linked them to earthquakes, but research finds no such connection. The sighting is rare and intriguing, but not a warning of danger. This discovery highlights how little we know about these deep‑sea creatures."
