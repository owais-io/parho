title: "EU Declares Iran’s Revolutionary Guard a Terrorist Organization"
summary: "On Thursday the EU officially listed Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. The move follows months of protests in Iran, where the IRGC has violently cracked down on demonstrators. The decision freezes the group’s assets and makes any support for it a crime. The EU also added 15 Iranian officials and six companies to its sanctions list for human‑rights abuses. This marks a strong rebuke of Tehran’s brutal repression."
