title: "Sweden and Germany cut foreign aid to support Ukraine and defence"
summary: "Sweden and Germany have slashed their foreign aid budgets, redirecting money to help Ukraine and boost defence spending. This shift means cuts to projects in Africa, Latin America and Asia, hurting programs that fight hunger, disease and poverty. Mozambique, already hit by drought and conflict, now has less food aid and health support. NGOs warn the cuts could reverse years of progress and destabilise local systems."
