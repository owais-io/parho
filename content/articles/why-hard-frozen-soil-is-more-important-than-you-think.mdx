title: "Why Hard, Frozen Soil Is More Important Than You Think"
summary: "On a cold moor, I walked on hard, frozen ground that feels solid and dry. The freeze keeps muddy paths clear and even preserves the footprints of animals and people. It also helps kill bad germs and gives the soil a new structure. But the cold protects billions of tiny life‑forms living in the soil. Climate change is warming the ground, killing those microbes. I’m glad the ground is hard because it keeps our ecosystems healthy."
