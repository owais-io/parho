title: "Bank CEOs Could Lose Shareholder Votes If They Ease Climate Targets"
summary: "ShareAction will publish reports on 34 big banks to see if they are cutting back on climate goals. If a bank chair is found to be loosening targets, shareholders may vote against re‑electing them at the bank’s spring meeting. The move aims to pressure banks, especially after the U.S. election and a wave of banks pulling out of the net‑zero pact. It’s a symbolic but potentially powerful way to hold leaders accountable."
