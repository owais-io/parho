title: "Most UK voters think immigration is rising, even though it has fallen sharply, poll finds"
summary: "A recent poll shows two‑thirds of UK voters think immigration is rising, even though the number of people coming into Britain has fallen by more than two‑thirds to just 204,000 last year. Only 18% trust the government on the issue, and confidence is lowest among Labour voters. The big public worry is about small boats, even though they make up less than 5% of arrivals. Hard‑line plans haven’t changed people’s minds."
