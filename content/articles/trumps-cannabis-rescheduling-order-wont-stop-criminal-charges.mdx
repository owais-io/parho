title: "Trump’s cannabis rescheduling order won’t stop criminal charges"
summary: "Trump’s new executive order tries to move marijuana out of the most restrictive drug list, but experts say it won’t help people who are being prosecuted for possession. The change is still being debated, and lawmakers and agencies have mixed feelings. Even if marijuana is moved to a lower category, the law still carries penalties, especially for non‑FDA approved products. Arrests for simple possession are still rising, especially for minorities and immigrants."
