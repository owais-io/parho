title: "Otters Come Back to UK Towns After Decades of Conservation"
summary: "Scientists and wildlife groups are happy to see otters popping up in UK cities and rivers again. After years of pollution and habitat loss, better water quality and targeted releases have helped their numbers grow. The animals have been spotted in places like London, Stratford and York, even in city streets. While anglers worry they eat fish, most eat small animals and don’t threaten fish stocks. Otters also show how clean rivers are."
