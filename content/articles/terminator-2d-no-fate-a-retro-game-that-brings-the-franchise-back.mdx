title: "Terminator 2D: No Fate – A Retro Game That Brings the Franchise Back"
summary: "Terminator 2D: No Fate is a retro‑style action game that brings the franchise back to life. It starts before the film, showing Sarah Connor trying to stop the future, and later lets you play as John Connor fighting Skynet. The early levels are the most fun, with running, shooting and beat‑‘em‑up moments. Some parts feel slow, but the game rewards replay with harder modes and new endings."
