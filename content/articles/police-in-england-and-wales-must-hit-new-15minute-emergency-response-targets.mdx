title: "Police in England and Wales must hit new 15‑minute emergency response targets"
summary: "Police in England and Wales will now have to arrive at serious crime scenes within 15 minutes in towns and 20 minutes in rural areas, the Home Office announced. The new rule will hold forces accountable, with data tracked nationally and slow forces sent extra help. While neighbourhood watch groups welcome the change, some commissioners warn extra staff and tech will be needed. The reform is part of a larger overhaul that may cut the number of forces and boost community patrols."
