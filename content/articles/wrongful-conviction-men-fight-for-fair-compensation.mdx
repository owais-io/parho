title: "Wrongful Conviction Men Fight for Fair Compensation"
summary: "Three men who spent 11 to 38 years in prison for crimes they didn’t commit are asking lawmakers to change how compensation is paid in England and Wales. Even after courts cleared them, they must still prove their innocence “beyond reasonable doubt” to get money. They say this is unfair and prevents them from getting help for mental‑health and housing needs. Parliament is reviewing the rules, but many still wait for payment."
