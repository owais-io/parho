title: "Long Covid Still Stops Me"
summary: "I’m a 34‑year‑old woman who got long Covid in April 2022. It made me lose my job, move back home, and spend all my savings on medicine. I can’t walk far, feel nausea all the time, and need 10‑12 hours of sleep. After months of bad politics and lost funding, doctors finally gave me therapy and swimming lessons that help me stay active."
