title: "Gold mining could kill the world’s rarest orangutan"
summary: "Jardine Matheson's Martabe gold mine in northern Sumatra plans new roads that cut through the home of the Tapanuli orangutan, the world’s rarest ape. Scientists say the expansion could wipe out the species, which has fewer than 800 left. The mine promises billions of dollars and jobs for locals, but the cost to the fragile rainforest and the apes may be too high. Conservation groups want the project to pause until a protection plan is in place."
