title: "Super League Rugby Returns with 14 Teams and New TV Deal"
summary: "Super League rugby has kicked off its 30‑year anniversary with a 14‑team lineup, adding York Knights and Toulouse Olympique and bringing back Bradford Bulls. Attendance and TV viewership are climbing thanks to an IMG partnership, but the old Sky Sports deal is shrinking and clubs are losing money, as shown by recent liquidations. Organisers hope a fresh broadcast bid will help keep the sport financially viable while new events like Magic Weekend and games in Las Vegas boost its profile."
