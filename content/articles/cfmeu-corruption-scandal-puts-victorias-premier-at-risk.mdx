title: "CFMEU corruption scandal puts Victoria’s premier at risk"
summary: "A report says the Victorian CFMEU turned into a crime syndicate, with drug dealers, bikies and strippers on construction sites, and that the state lost at least $15 billion. The findings have put Premier Jacinta Allan in hot water, as she had previously let the allegations slip to the anti‑corruption watchdog. She calls the claims “sickening” and says she’s stepped up police powers and may push for a royal commission. Most workers say they’re honest."
