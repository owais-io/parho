title: "Warm spring in Europe, cold hits southeastern U.S."
summary: "Europe gets a warm spring break, with Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands seeing almost record‑setting 20 °C and France near 25 °C. A big high‑pressure system keeps the air dry and much of the continent 10–15 °C warmer than usual. While Portugal and north‑west Spain may still get rain, the southern U.S. faces a chilly surprise. States like Alabama and Florida could drop to 7 °C, and a strong Nor’easter brings blizzard‑level snow to New York and Boston."
