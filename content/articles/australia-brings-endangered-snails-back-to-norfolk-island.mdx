title: "Australia Brings Endangered Snails Back to Norfolk Island"
summary: "In June, a plane carried 800 tiny snails from a zoo in Sydney back to Norfolk Island, where the species once lived but was thought extinct. Scientists discovered the snails in 2020 and started a breeding program at Taronga Zoo. After raising them, the team released most of them into a protected valley, but a mold outbreak killed many before release. The snails are now slowly spreading and scientists hope they will thrive."
