title: "I thought a cannabis edible would ease Christmas, but I ended up on the floor"
summary: "I tried a cannabis edible to stay calm during a tense family Christmas. Instead I over‑eaten and became extremely high. I lost control, fell into a blackout, and spent hours lying on my bedroom floor while relatives ate. The situation was awkward and stressful, but I eventually snapped back to reality. The experience taught me that edibles can be unpredictable and may make family gatherings harder."
