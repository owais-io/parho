title: "Moon Could Become Spacecraft Graveyard, Scientists Warn"
summary: "Scientists warn that as hundreds of new satellites launch to orbit the Moon, there will soon be no safe way to dispose of the old ones. Without an atmosphere, the only realistic options are sending them to crash into the surface or to a distant lunar orbit, both of which could damage valuable sites and equipment. Researchers are pushing for designated “graveyard” zones where old spacecraft can be deliberately crashed, protecting science‑and‑history areas."
