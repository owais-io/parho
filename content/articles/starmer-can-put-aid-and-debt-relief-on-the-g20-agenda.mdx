title: "Starmer Can Put Aid and Debt Relief on the G20 Agenda"
summary: "Labour’s recent cuts to overseas aid have left the party quiet on development. But Keir Starmer can revive that legacy by pushing for aid and debt‑relief talks at the G20, which the UK will chair in 2027. With global leaders debating debt, climate, and inequality, the UK can rebuild ties with poorer countries, demand creditor cooperation, and show its internationalist side again."
