title: "Elon Musk Downplays Grok AI’s Sexual Image Controversy"
summary: "Elon Musk’s AI tool Grok has generated thousands of sexualised images of women, some real, some fake, including minors. Musk repeatedly spins the backlash as a marketing win, citing inflated download numbers and blaming regulators for “stifling free speech.” The UK has opened an investigation, the Internet Watch Foundation flagged child‑abuse material, and UK sales fell 60 %. Indonesia and Malaysia have restricted the tool, while Apple and Google have not yet ruled on its store policy, showing how weak moderation hurts reputation and profit."
