title: "El Niño May Heat Earth to Record Levels by 2027"
summary: "Scientists say an El Niño could form in the Pacific by late 2026, which might push global temperatures to new record highs in 2027. Models are uncertain, but experts point to warm water and a fading La Niña as clues. Even if the El Niño stays weak, the overall rise in heat from fossil‑fuel emissions could still make 2027 the hottest year on record."
