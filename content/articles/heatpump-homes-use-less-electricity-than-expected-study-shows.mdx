title: "Heat‑pump homes use less electricity than expected, study shows"
summary: "A study of seven new social‑housing homes in Birmingham found that heat‑pump systems actually put less strain on the power grid than predicted. Peak electricity use was lower, and yearly consumption was 40‑67 % below the UK average. Residents liked the homes, reporting no damp, mold or asthma problems. The results suggest heat pumps are a good fit for future housing standards and may reduce the need for extra grid capacity."
