title: "Scotland’s May election: Which parties can win voters’ trust?"
summary: "Scotland is heading to a May election that could shift its politics. The long‑ruling SNP is losing enthusiasm and trust, even as it keeps polling ahead. Labour faces backlash from its Westminster image, but its strong ground team gives it hope. Reform UK is gaining ground in key areas and could turn support into seats. Voters may vote tactically to stop Reform, so the race will hinge on fear and fatigue as much as ideas."
