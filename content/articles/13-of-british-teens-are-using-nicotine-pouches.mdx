title: "13% of British Teens Are Using Nicotine Pouches"
summary: "Teenagers in Britain are using nicotine pouches, a small flavored sachet that releases nicotine. A survey of 500 14‑to‑17‑year‑olds found 13 % had tried one, and a third use them weekly. Many get them from friends or shops that sell to anyone. Most teens want stronger rules, and the UK government plans a bill that will stop sales to under‑18s, cut flavours and tighten packaging to protect young people."
