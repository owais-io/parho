title: "Young Brits Are Cutting Alcohol – What Will Their Nightlife Look Like?"
summary: "A new NHS survey found that 24 % of adults in England have stopped drinking, a jump from 19 % in 2022. Young people, especially Gen Z, are the most sober, with only 10 % drinking frequently. The trend is partly due to cost‑of‑living pressures but also a cultural shift that sees getting drunk as uncool. While this lowers NHS costs, the country still spends billions on alcohol‑related illness."
