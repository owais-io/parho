title: "Trump ally launches new probe of former FBI and CIA officials after 2016 Russia investigation"
summary: "A Trump‑aligned U.S. attorney in Miami, Jason Reding Quiñones, has expanded a probe into former FBI and CIA officials involved in the 2016 Russia investigation. The inquiry, which has issued about 24 subpoenas, names figures such as John Brennan, James Clapper, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Former prosecutors say it’s a fishing expedition with no evidence and has caused two young attorneys to quit. Critics argue the probe is political retaliation, not a credible criminal case."
