title: "AI Transcription Tools Create Wrong Notes for Social Workers"
summary: "AI transcription tools used by UK social workers can save time, but a new study shows they often create false or confusing notes. Some summaries wrongly flag suicidal intent, while others insert made‑up words like “fishfingers.” The errors risk bad decisions about children’s care and could harm both clients and workers. While the tools promise better relationships, regulators are calling for clearer rules and better training."
