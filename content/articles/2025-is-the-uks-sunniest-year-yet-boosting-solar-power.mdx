title: "2025 Is the UK's Sunniest Year Yet, Boosting Solar Power"
summary: "2025 was the sunniest year in the UK’s history, with more sunshine than any year since 1910. England led the way, while Scotland and Wales also had record sunny seasons. The extra sunshine helped solar farms produce over 6% of the country’s energy – a 50% jump from recent years. The hot, dry summer was the hottest ever, and rain fell less than usual. Scientists think cleaner air might be making skies clearer, but climate change isn’t confirmed to raise sunshine."
