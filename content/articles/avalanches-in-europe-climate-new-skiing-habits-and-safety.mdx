title: "Avalanches in Europe: Climate, New Skiing Habits and Safety"
summary: "Avalanches kill about 100 people each year in Europe, but the trend is flat. Heavy snow can build weak layers that trigger avalanches, especially when people ski off the marked trails. More skiers mean more exposure, yet better forecasts, gear and quick rescues keep deaths from rising. Climate change may shrink the season but could make high‑altitude snow wetter and more dangerous."
