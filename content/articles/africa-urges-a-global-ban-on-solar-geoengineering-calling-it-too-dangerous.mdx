title: "Africa Urges a Global Ban on Solar Geoengineering, Calling It Too Dangerous"
summary: "Africa is urging a global ban on solar geoengineering, the risky tech that would spray particles into the sky to cool the planet. At this week’s UN environment talks in Nairobi, African diplomats say it poses huge environmental, ethical and political risks and won’t cut greenhouse‑gas emissions. They want a worldwide “non‑use” treaty to stop funding, experiments and promotion. While some countries and firms push the research, the continent’s stance keeps the focus on cutting emissions and investing in clean energy."
