title: "FTSE 10,000: A Missed Chance to Promote Investing"
summary: "The FTSE 100 just crossed 10,000 points, a round number that some people treat as meaningless. The UK chancellor tweeted it as proof the economy is strong, but most of the companies in the index make most of their money overseas, so the figure says little about Britain. The rise could have sparked a big marketing push to get more people into stocks, but the City stayed quiet and missed the opportunity."
