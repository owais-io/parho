title: "LGB+ People in England and Wales Live About a Year Less Than Straight People, Office for National Statistics Finds"
summary: "A new Office for National Statistics report shows that people who identify as gay, bisexual or another LGB+ identity in England and Wales have a life expectancy about a year lower than straight people. Men’s expectancy is 59.4 versus 60.7 years, and women’s is 63.0 versus 64.0 years. The gap may stem from discrimination, stress, and higher rates of suicide, alcohol and drug problems."
