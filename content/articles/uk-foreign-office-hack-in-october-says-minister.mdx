summary: "A hack hit the UK’s Foreign Office in October, the minister Chris Bryant said. He told Sky News the attack probably won’t affect ordinary people and the government has closed the security hole fast. While some media claim a Chinese hacker group called Storm 1849 did it, Bryant said the real culprit is still unknown and he cautions against guessing. Investigators are looking into a possible link with a larger state‑sponsored attack known as ArcaneDoor."
