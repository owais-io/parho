title: "Somerset proves Britain can build good council homes – why haven’t others followed?"
summary: "Carole Guscott moved into a £500‑a‑month council flat in Minehead, showing that decent council housing is still possible. The Rainbow Way site has 54 homes, many for people who had been homeless or in temporary care. Somerset is using a £39 bn national fund to build more, but a large 2012 debt and limits on the right‑to‑buy are slowing progress. Other councils, like Southwark, can’t borrow because of that debt and still need money to build."
