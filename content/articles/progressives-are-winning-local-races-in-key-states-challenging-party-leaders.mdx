title: "Progressives Are Winning Local Races in Key States, Challenging Party Leaders"
summary: "Progressives are winning local races in swing states, beating established Democratic leaders. In cities like Dayton, Ohio and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, young candidates have focused on housing, transit and real‑world problems, cutting through the party’s old guard. Voters dislike the party’s top‑tier decisions, like the Gaza war stance and cuts to health subsidies. This shift could change national politics, but the party’s split may hurt it in the 2028 election."
