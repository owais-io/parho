title: "Starmer Faces Tough 2026 Test as UK Politicians Look for Change"
summary: "Starmer is entering 2026 as the UK’s least‑popular prime minister, but he believes it will be the year he shows voters progress. He must handle a new school‑reform plan that could cut the costly EHCP system, risking a rebellion. Local elections in Scotland, Wales and England could weaken Labour enough to spark a leadership challenge. Starmer also plans a big new King’s speech and faces tough US talks, while a controversial single‑sex‑space rule threatens trans‑rights protests."
