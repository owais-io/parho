title: "Europe Fails to Condemn Trump’s Illegal Attack on Venezuela: Why It’s a Problem"
summary: "Europe has mostly stayed silent about the U.S. plan to oust Venezuela’s dictator Nicolás Maduro, even though the move breaks international law. Only a few countries, like Spain and the Netherlands, spoke out. Some leaders question the legality or even support the U.S. attack, claiming it’s self‑defence. The article says European quietism is driven by fear of Trump’s anger over Ukraine, worries about Greenland, and Russia’s ties to Maduro, but these excuses ignore danger of foreign interference to Europe’s security."
