title: "UK local councils warn finances are at breaking point"
summary: "Local councils across England and Wales say their money is running out. With the government set to announce a new funding plan next week, many councils already need emergency loans and face steep cuts that could stop basic services. 29 councils, including Croydon, Birmingham and Norfolk, have hit budget gaps. The government’s “fair funding” review aims to raise money for poorer areas, but councils fear it will leave them worse off and may still need tax hikes or asset sales."
