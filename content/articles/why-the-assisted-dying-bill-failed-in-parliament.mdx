title: "Why the Assisted Dying Bill Failed in Parliament"
summary: "A bill that would let terminally ill people end their lives with medical help passed the House of Commons, but it hit a wall in the House of Lords. With no government support, peers piled on over a thousand amendments and stalled the vote before the parliamentary session ends in May. Campaigners say this is undemocratic, and supporters plan to try again next term, even hinting at using a rare override rule."
