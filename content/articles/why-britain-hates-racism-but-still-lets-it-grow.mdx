title: "Why Britain hates racism but still lets it grow"
summary: "The letter argues that Britain claims to hate racism yet often excuses it by thinking only “racists” are responsible. In reality, racism can stem from everyday attitudes, jokes or unintentional behaviour. Politicians use hard‑line anti‑immigration rhetoric that hides racist ideas, and the public often misses this link. The writer warns that without recognizing how ordinary actions feed racism, we remain passive witnesses, letting it spread quietly."
