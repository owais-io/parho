title: "Iowa Farmers Trade 8,000 Pigs for Mushrooms to Boost Health and Sustainability"
summary: "Tanner Faaborg, a sixth‑generation Iowa farmer, turned his family’s pig farm into a mushroom farm, growing lion’s‑mane and oyster varieties. With help from the Transfarmation Project, he and his brother re‑used farm buildings, learned new growing techniques, and sell mushroom‑based products online. The switch aims to cut environmental damage, reduce debt, and improve farmers’ mental health, showing that a smaller, independent model is possible."
