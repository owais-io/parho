title: "UK regulator fast‑tracks three new power cables"
summary: "UK regulator Ofgem has approved three big cable projects that will move wind power from Scotland and the North Sea to the south sooner than planned. The new lines will let more electricity reach the grid, cutting the money power companies pay to turn wind farms off when they generate too much. Fast‑tracking could save consumers £3‑6 billion in the future, but the extra construction cost may raise bills a little today. Some locals worry about the build work."
