title: "Keep Health and Safety Rules Strong to Protect Workers and Boost Growth"
summary: "John Fingleton claims UK health and safety rules slow infrastructure, but that’s wrong. Cutting these rules would endanger lives, raise costs for the NHS, businesses and taxpayers. The current framework has already cut workplace deaths and injuries, saving £22.9 bn in 2023‑24. Good safety lets companies grow without risk. Removing protections would slow projects, hurt reputations and increase future healthcare bills."
