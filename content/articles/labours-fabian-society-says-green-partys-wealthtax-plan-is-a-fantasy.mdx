title: "Labour’s Fabian Society says Green Party’s wealth‑tax plan is a fantasy"
summary: "In an interview, Joe Dromey, the Fabian Society’s chief, warned Labour to push back against Green Party leader Zack Polanski’s “fantasy” ideas, such as a wealth tax that would only touch the richest 0.1% and can’t cover public services. He said the party must tackle populism on both sides – Polanski’s left‑wing and Nigel Farage’s right‑wing – and show real competence on issues like migration, social care and fiscal responsibility."
