He warned that Russia could strike Ukrainian government buildings and that the Kremlin’s claim was a lie to justify more attacks. The Ukrainian leader met with Trump in Florida, discussed 15‑year security guarantees and a 20‑point peace plan, while Russia demanded Ukrainian troops pull back from the Donetsk frontier. Ukraine keeps demanding a demilitarised zone and long‑term guarantees."
