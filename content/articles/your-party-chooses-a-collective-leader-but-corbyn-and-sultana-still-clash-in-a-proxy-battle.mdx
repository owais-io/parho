title: "Your Party Chooses a Collective Leader, but Corbyn and Sultana Still Clash in a Proxy Battle"
summary: "Your Party chose a group of 16 people to run it instead of picking a single leader. That means Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana can still clash, but through their supporters. At the Liverpool conference, Sultana skipped the first day because some members were expelled. Members still say the fight is on, though they hope it ends soon. The party also wants to work with the Greens and has fixed its name."
