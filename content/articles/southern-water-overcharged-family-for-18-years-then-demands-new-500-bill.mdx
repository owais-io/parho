title: "Southern Water Overcharged Family for 18 Years, Then Demands New £500 Bill"
summary: "A tenant discovered a £614 water bill from Southern Water that actually belonged to a neighbour. The company had wrongly linked a neighbour’s meter to a vulnerable customer’s account for 18 years, overcharging her. After fixing the meter, Southern cancelled the bill and gave the customer a £500 credit, but later reversed it, now demanding £500 even though actual usage is about £100. Calls give mixed answers, leaving the customer frustrated."
