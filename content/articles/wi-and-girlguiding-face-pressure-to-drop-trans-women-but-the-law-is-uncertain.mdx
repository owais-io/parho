title: "WI and Girlguiding Face Pressure to Drop Trans Women, but the Law Is Uncertain"
summary: "The Women’s Institute and Girlguiding have announced plans to stop admitting trans women and trans girls, citing a Supreme Court ruling that redefines “sex” in the Equality Act. The article argues the ruling actually gives organizations room to remain inclusive. Instead, outside groups are threatening lawsuits and lobbying for exclusion. The author notes that the law does not require cutting out trans people, and many feel they are being misled. Supporters must stand up."
