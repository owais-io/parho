title: "Secretly Working Two Full‑Time Jobs"
summary: "Polygamous working means secretly holding two or more full‑time jobs at the same time. Because many people now work from home or have flexible hours, it can be hard to notice. The National Fraud Initiative has found 13 cases last year and is cracking down, especially in the public sector. Some workers share how to juggle jobs on Reddit, but doing so can break contracts and even lead to fraud convictions."
