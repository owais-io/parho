title: "The Supreme Court Is Losing Public Trust—It May Need a Change"
summary: "In the United States, the Supreme Court has lost the public's trust, especially after conservatives used it to give President Trump more power. Liberal justices now fight back, but they disagree on how to respond. Many think the court should be reformed or replaced so that it can truly represent the people, not just a political agenda. The article argues that we must rebuild the court’s legitimacy or create a new system to protect democracy."
