The slump was largely caused by a cyber‑attack on Jaguar Land Rover that halted car production and pushed vehicle output to a 73‑year low. Growth in services and construction slowed, and business investment fell. Unemployment rose to 5 %, the highest in four years. The data raise hopes the Bank of England will cut rates in December, while the chancellor faces a budget that could raise taxes."
