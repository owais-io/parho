title: "1 in 14 of England’s child deaths involve parents who are close relatives"
summary: "Researchers looked at 13,045 child deaths in England from 2019‑2023. They found 926 (about 7%) were children of close relatives, like first cousins. Those children made up a large share of deaths, especially among Asian families—mostly Pakistani—and lived in the most deprived areas. Many deaths were linked to genetic and congenital problems, and the NHS is testing a new nurse‑led program to help families where such marriages are common."
