title: "Fiji to give Indigenous people control over surf reefs"
summary: "Fiji wants to give its Indigenous iTaukei people control and money from surfing spots that have long drawn tourists. After a 2010 ban on private leases, many resorts paid local tribes for waves like Cloudbreak. Now a new law will let iTaukei register reef areas and negotiate leases, so they get a share of tourism profits. Some hotel owners worry about costs and unclear rules, but many support the move."
