title: "UK high streets are collapsing – Reform sees a chance"
summary: "Every year, more than a dozen UK shops shut each day. In 2024 alone, 13,500 stores, from big chains to family businesses, went out of business. Empty high streets have attracted crime, with the National Crime Agency seizing over £10m in illegal proceeds. Reform UK says this is a chance to gain votes, while the government offers programs like Pride in Place to help revitalize town centres. Successful projects in Stockton and Plymouth show that local change is possible."
