title: "Corporate greed that hurt the U.S. is also ruining Britain"
summary: "Corporate greed that hurt the U.S. has also damaged Britain. The letter points out that Reagan in the U.S. and Thatcher in the U.K. pushed deregulation and privatization, which made wages stagnate and cut jobs. In Britain, this led to higher rents, food banks, zero‑hour contracts, and an unequal society. It also criticises the current government for letting foreign companies run NHS data and says the U.K. must act more decisively."
