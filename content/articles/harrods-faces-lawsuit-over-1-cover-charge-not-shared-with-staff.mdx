title: "Harrods Faces Lawsuit Over £1 Cover Charge Not Shared With Staff"
summary: "Harrods is being sued over a £1 cover charge that goes to the company, not the staff, even though a 2024 law says all tips and service charges must be shared with workers. A union-backed tribunal case will test whether the cover charge counts as a tip. Workers argue it is essentially a tip, but Harrods says it is a separate mandatory fee. The case could set a precedent for other high‑end restaurants."
