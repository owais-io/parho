title: "Premier League clubs worry new rules will raise policing costs by millions"
summary: "Premier League clubs say that a Home Office plan could force them to pay extra policing costs, adding up to millions each year. Right now clubs only cover police on their own grounds, but the new move would include surrounding areas. A big match in March cost £2 million, and a Millwall‑Leeds game could cost over £100,000. Clubs, rugby, cricket and event organisers have written to the government, while the Home Office says it wants to share the cost safely."
