title: "New bone study suggests an early upright walker, but scientists still disagree"
summary: "Scientists examined the bones of Sahelanthropus, an ape‑like animal that lived about 7 million years ago in Africa. They found clues that its thigh and other bones were shaped for walking on two legs, making it a strong candidate for the first upright walker in our family tree. However, other researchers say the evidence is weak and more fossils are needed to settle the debate."
