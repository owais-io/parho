title: "Trump Claims Prices Are Dropping, but Americans Still Feel the Burden"
summary: "Trump says the affordability crisis is over, yet most Americans still feel the pinch. Inflation eased only to 2.4% last month, and new tariffs have pushed prices higher for food, clothing, and energy. Consumers are bearing most of the cost, and many businesses plan to raise prices through 2026. Voters blame Trump for the rising cost of living, and the problem has no quick fix."
