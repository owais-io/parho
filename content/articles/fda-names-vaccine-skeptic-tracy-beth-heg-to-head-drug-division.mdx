title: "FDA Names Vaccine Skeptic Tracy Beth Høeg to Head Drug Division"
summary: "The FDA has named Tracy Beth Høeg, a Danish‑American doctor who has publicly questioned COVID‑19 vaccines, as acting director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Høeg has no background in drug regulation and has mainly focused on vaccine safety. Critics worry she may shift the agency’s focus toward vaccine issues, cut back on drug approvals, and follow Denmark’s less‑rigorous vaccination schedule. The move raises concerns about the FDA’s priorities and transparency."
