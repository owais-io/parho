title: "Fixing Capital Gains Tax Is Good, but Cutting Taxes for the Rich Is Wrong"
summary: "With the federal budget coming up, Australia will finally tweak its capital‑gain tax, ending the 50 % discount that mainly helps the wealthiest. Some politicians want to pair this with new tax cuts for high‑income earners, arguing they’re over‑taxed. The article shows those with over $250 k earn two‑thirds of capital gains, but data puts Australia’s top tax rates below many OECD countries. Removing the discount doesn’t need extra cuts."
