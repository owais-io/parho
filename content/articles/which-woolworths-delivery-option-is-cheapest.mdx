title: "Which Woolworths delivery option is cheapest?"
summary: "The Guardian tested Woolworths’ four delivery options – the store’s own site, DoorDash, UberEats and Milkrun – to see which is cheapest. Prices on the shop’s website were lower, but a $15 delivery fee made it the most expensive for quick deliveries. DoorDash and UberEats had similar costs, while Milkrun was the cheapest and fastest. Buying in‑store was still cheapest overall."
