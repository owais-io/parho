title: "Social mobility is still seen from a right‑wing perspective"
summary: "Alun Francis, head of the Social Mobility Commission, says Labour’s Keir Starmer has no clear plan for moving people up the social ladder. The commission was reshaped in 2021 by the then‑Conservative minister Liz Truss, and most members now have ties to the Conservative party. Francis’s report keeps a right‑wing view, downplaying how hard it is for working‑class families to reach top jobs. Critics argue we need an equality plan, not just a mobility plan."
