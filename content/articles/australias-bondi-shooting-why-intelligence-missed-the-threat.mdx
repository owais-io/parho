title: "Australia’s Bondi Shooting: Why Intelligence Missed the Threat"
summary: "A week after the worst mass shooting on an Australian beach, people are asking why the father‑son pair that carried out the attack stayed hidden from police and intelligence. The 24‑year‑old Naveed Akram was watched by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in 2019 for links to an Islamic State cell, but after six months he was cleared. He and his father travelled to the Philippines a month before the attack, raising questions about what the agencies knew and how they share information."
