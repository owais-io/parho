title: "Russia’s economy can survive a drop in oil prices"
summary: "Russia’s economy depends on oil, but analysts say it can survive a drop in prices because the government has cut spending and built reserves. U.S. sanctions already cut oil income, and the rouble has risen. Still, Russia can raise taxes to keep the war funded. A sharper hit to oil sales would hurt, but the country isn’t on the brink of collapse yet. Europe must tighten sanctions to help end the war."
