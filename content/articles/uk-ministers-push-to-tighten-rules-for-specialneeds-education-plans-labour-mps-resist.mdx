title: "UK Ministers Push to Tighten Rules for Special‑Needs Education Plans, Labour MPs Resist"
summary: "UK ministers are pushing a new rule that will make it harder for children with special educational needs to get a formal support plan. The change would raise the bar for who qualifies for an EHCP, meaning only the most severe cases would be covered. Labour MPs and parents fear this cuts essential rights and could hurt children. The government says it’s not a cost‑cutting move but still faces a fight in Parliament."
