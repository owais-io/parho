title: "How Serious Is a Sneeze? Understanding the Reflex"
summary: "A sneeze is just the body’s way of clearing irritants from the nose. Allergens, cold air, bright light, and even dust can trigger it. The force isn’t as wild as people think—speeds around 10 mph and a meter away. While sneezes can spread colds, flu and COVID, they’re usually harmless. To stay safe, sneeze into a tissue or your elbow, keep distance, and wear a mask if you’re around sick people."
