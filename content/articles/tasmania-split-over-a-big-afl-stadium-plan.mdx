title: "Tasmania Split Over a Big AFL Stadium Plan"
summary: "Tasmania is debating a big AFL stadium that would let the state join Australia’s top football league. About 15,000 people gathered at Parliament House to support the plan, while other groups oppose it because it would cost more than $1 billion and hurt local sites. Premier Jeremy Rockliff says the stadium will bring jobs and money, but critics say the deal is unfair and the land is wrong. Parliament will vote on the stadium this week."
