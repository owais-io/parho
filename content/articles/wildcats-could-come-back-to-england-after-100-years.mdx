title: "Wildcats Could Come Back to England After 100 Years"
summary: "A two‑year study shows that bringing European wildcats back to Devon is possible and many locals support it. The area has enough woodlands and grasslands for the cats to live, hunt, and stay safe from people or livestock. About 40‑50 cats might be released after 2027, but careful work will be needed to stop cats from mixing with local stray cats. The project hopes to restore a once‑common species and help balance the local wildlife."
