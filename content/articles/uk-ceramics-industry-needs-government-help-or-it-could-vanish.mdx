title: "UK Ceramics Industry Needs Government Help or It Could Vanish"
summary: "British potteries, especially in Staffordshire, are in trouble because of soaring energy bills and competition from cheap imports. Unions and the Green Alliance are asking the government to step in with quick help—cutting gas prices, easing rules, and giving money to modernise plants. The sector supports around 20,000 jobs and is linked to key industries like defence and medical tech. Without more support, the UK could lose a vital part of its heritage and economy."
