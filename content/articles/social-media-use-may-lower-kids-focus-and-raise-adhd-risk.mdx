title: "Social media use may lower kids' focus and raise ADHD risk"
summary: "Researchers found that kids who spend more time on social media have a harder time staying focused, possibly raising ADHD rates. The study followed over 8,000 US children ages 10‑14 and linked 1.4 hours of social media daily to more inattention. TV and video games didn’t show the same effect. The findings suggest tighter age checks and better guidelines for tech companies."
