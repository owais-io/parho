title: "Chernobyl shelter damaged by drone, no longer blocks radiation – IAEA"
summary: "A drone hit the new protective shelter around the Chernobyl reactor in February, creating a hole that lets radiation escape. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the shelter can’t do its job anymore and must be repaired urgently. There’s no evidence of a radiation leak right now, but the damage could worsen if not fixed. The attack was blamed on Russia, but Moscow denies involvement. Ukraine and the IAEA are working to restore safety."
