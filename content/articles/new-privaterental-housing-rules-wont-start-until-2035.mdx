title: "New private‑rental housing rules won’t start until 2035"
summary: "England’s government said private rental homes will have to meet a new ‘decent homes’ standard, but it won’t be enforced until 2035. Landlords get a decade to fix problems like damp, mould and bad heating. Campaigners say that’s too long and that thousands of renters will keep living in unsafe, unheated houses. Some parts of the rule will come sooner, but most deadlines are still years away."
