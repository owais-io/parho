title: "Vaping is safer than smoking, but many people find quitting hard"
summary: "Vaping has become more common than smoking in the UK, but many users say quitting is harder than expected. While experts agree vaping is far less harmful than cigarettes, it still delivers addictive nicotine and is easy to use in daily life. Research shows that a mix of nicotine‑replacement, gradual reduction, and behavioral support—like text messages or therapy—helps people quit. Young people are especially at risk, so quitting vaping is seen as a way to avoid starting or returning to smoking."
