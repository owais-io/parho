title: "NIH halts funding for research using fetal tissue from elective abortions"
summary: "The NIH has decided to stop funding any research that uses fetal tissue from elective abortions. The rule goes into effect right away, following a pause in 2019 and a reversal in 2021. Scientists can still use tissue from miscarriages, but most prefer abortion tissue because it is easier to collect and usually healthier. The tissue has helped scientists study diseases like diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and make vaccines."
