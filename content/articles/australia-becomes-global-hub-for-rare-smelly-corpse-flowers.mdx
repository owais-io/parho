title: "Australia Becomes Global Hub for Rare, Smelly Corpse Flowers"
summary: "Australia is turning into a hotspot for the world’s rarest and stinky flower, the corpse flower. In 2025, more than a dozen plants burst into bloom across the country, from Sydney’s Putricia to Adelaide’s giant Smellanie. The flowers take 10‑12 years to flower, but once they do, they emit a powerful smell that attracts flies. With over 250 plants in Adelaide’s garden, visitors line up to see and smell them."
