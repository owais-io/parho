title: "AI is pushing young workers into construction jobs"
summary: "Construction firms are short on workers because many older builders are retiring and fewer young people are choosing manual jobs. Office jobs are getting automated by AI, so students are now looking at trades that still need hands‑on skills. Trade school enrolments have jumped after the pandemic, and construction demand is set to rise again as the economy recovers. This could create more jobs for young people who want steady pay and a clear career path."
