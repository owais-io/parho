title: "Republican Governors Call Muslim Group Terrorist, Putting Everyone at Risk"
summary: "The deputy director of the Council on American‑Islamic Relations says Texas and Florida governors are putting everyone at risk by labeling the civil‑rights group CAIR a terrorist organization. CAIR denies any links to the Muslim Brotherhood or Hamas, but the orders stop it from buying property and getting state contracts. The director warns that any governor could declare any group terrorist, threatening free speech and civil‑rights work. He calls the designations unconstitutional and says CAIR is still running normally."
