title: "SNCF Bans Children on Some Trains, Sparks Debate in France"
summary: "SNCF, France’s train company, rolled out a new TGV fare that blocks kids under 12 from a few seats on the Paris‑Lyon route. The change aimed to make business‑travellers’ rides quieter, but parents and politicians slammed it as un‑French. The debate touches France’s low birthrate and the rise of “child‑free” spaces in cafés and hotels. The company said the rule covers only a tiny share of seats, and it has since removed the age limit from its website."
