title: "Kids Learn Gumbaynggirr at New Australian School"
summary: "Three years ago, the Gumbaynggirr Giingana Freedom School opened on New South Wales’ mid‑north coast, teaching kids in their native Gumbaynggirr language and English. The bilingual program has boosted attendance (88 %) and confidence, with parents even moving long distances for it. While critics say the language is ‘dead’, the school shows strong NAPLAN results and high student joy. It’s part of a wider effort, led by local groups, to revive the Gumbaynggirr tongue and give children cultural pride."
