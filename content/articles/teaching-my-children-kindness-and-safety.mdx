summary: "About 1 in 8 women in England and Wales faced violence last year, with almost 200 rapes recorded daily and three women killed each week. The government says this is a national emergency and has launched the biggest crack‑down ever. The plan focuses on stopping young men from learning violent attitudes, protecting victims, improving policing and courts, and teaching boys and girls about consent and respect. It also calls for more positive male role models."
