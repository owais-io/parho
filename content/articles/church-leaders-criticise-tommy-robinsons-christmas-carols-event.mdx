title: "Church Leaders Criticise Tommy Robinson’s Christmas Carols Event"
summary: "A letter from a London Catholic pastor complains that Tommy Robinson’s new Christmas carols event tries to use Christianity to push against multifaith communities. He worries about excluding people from different backgrounds—Nigerian priests, Filipino servers, various ethnic groups—and even asks if they should uninvite the local imam or Jewish friends. The writer welcomes a broader church response, including bishops, cardinals, and a rabbi, to show that Robinson’s ideas are not true Christian teachings."
