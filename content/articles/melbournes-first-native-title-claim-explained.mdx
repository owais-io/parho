title: "Melbourne’s First Native Title Claim Explained"
summary: "In July, the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people filed a native title claim over Melbourne. Native title is a legal recognition that Aboriginal groups had rights to land before Europeans arrived. The claim won’t change ownership of private homes or businesses, but it could let the Wurundjeri help manage parks and protect culturally important sites. The process is long and hard, but it would give the people a say in decisions about crown land in the city."
