title: "Health Secretary Offers Bigger Pay to Stop Resident Doctor Strikes"
summary: "Wes Streeting, Britain’s health secretary, plans to give resident doctors a much larger pay rise than the 2.5% NHS offer, possibly doubling it. He also wants hospitals fined if they fail to give doctors proper rest areas and hot food, and to pay for extra hours. The move aims to stop the 14 strikes that have cost the NHS about £250 m. The BMA still wants a 26% pay rise and more training spots. Most Britons oppose the strikes."
