title: "UK Inflation Falls to 3% – Lowest in Almost a Year"
summary: "UK inflation dropped to 3% in January, the lowest level in almost a year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Prices fell because fuel, airfares and food were cheaper, though hotel and takeaway costs rose a bit. The 0.5% monthly decline could give the Bank of England a reason to cut interest rates. Analysts expect inflation to hit the 2% target by mid‑2026."
