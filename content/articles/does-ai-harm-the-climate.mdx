title: "Does AI Harm the Climate?"
summary: "AI servers use a lot of electricity, often from coal or gas, so they release greenhouse gases. The growth of data centres could slow clean‑energy progress and increase global warming. Scientists worry about the big energy use and the risk of more fossil‑fuel use. Yet some experts say AI can save carbon by helping renewables, improving batteries and cutting other industries' emissions. Because the truth is mixed, many want stricter rules and better data on AI’s energy use."
