title: "AI Helps Find Breast Cancer Earlier, Study Shows"
summary: "The new study from Sweden shows that using artificial intelligence to read mammograms can cut later cancer diagnoses by 12 % and spot more cancers early. Researchers followed 100,000 women who were randomly split between AI‑assisted and regular double‑reader screening. The AI version found 81 % of cancers at the first test, compared with 74 % for the standard method. Experts say the tech can ease radiologists’ workload but must be tested carefully."
