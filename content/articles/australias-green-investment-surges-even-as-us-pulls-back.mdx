title: "Australia’s Green Investment Surges Even as US Pulls Back"
summary: "Australia’s green investment has jumped from $20bn to $157bn in five years, even as the US backs away from climate policy. 137bn of that money is backing projects that cut emissions, clean water and grow trees. Super funds and green bonds are driving the surge, with 25bn already in the first half of 2025. Investors say they’re wary of greenwashing but still want money to make a real difference. Clear rules and better measurement are still needed."
