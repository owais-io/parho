title: "War Leaves Gaza Cancer Patients Trapped"
summary: "Gaza’s war and blockade have left many cancer patients without care. Doctors say the fighting and the closed borders mean patients can’t reach hospitals in Jerusalem or the West Bank, and essential drugs are scarce. Hospitals have been hit or shut down, and basic tools like biopsy needles are missing. While some patients have escaped, most are stuck, facing pain, fever, and rising death rates."
