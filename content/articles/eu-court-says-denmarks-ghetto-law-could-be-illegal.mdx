title: "EU court says Denmark’s “ghetto law” could be illegal"
summary: "The EU court said Denmark’s 2018 “ghetto law” that lets the state demolish apartments in neighborhoods with at least half non‑Western residents might break EU race‑equality rules. The law forces a 40% cut in social housing by 2030 in so‑called “parallel societies.” The court flagged potential discrimination and sent the case back to Danish courts. Residents in Copenhagen’s Mjølnerparken feel the ruling gives them hope to win a domestic appeal."
