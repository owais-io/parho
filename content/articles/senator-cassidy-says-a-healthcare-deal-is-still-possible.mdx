title: "Senator Cassidy Says a Healthcare Deal Is Still Possible"
summary: "Senator Bill Cassidy, the chair of the Senate health committee, said he thinks a bipartisan agreement on health‑care costs can still be reached, even after both Democrats and Republicans failed to pass bills last week. His plan would give people $1,000 in the government health savings account (and $500 for ages 50‑64) to help pay high deductibles, with limits on using the money for abortions or gender‑affirming care. Cassidy says Democrats need to consider these out‑of‑pocket costs and is willing to extend short‑term premium tax credits to help people afford insurance. He hopes both sides can find common ground before the current subsidies expire."
