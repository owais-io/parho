title: "E.ON Cancels Huge Bill for Deceased Customer, Still Owes £3,360"
summary: "A 26‑year‑old discovered that his aunt’s energy account was being overcharged and had a £6,000 credit. After the aunt died, E.ON used part of that credit and later deducted £3,360 from it. The company also sent a £12,960 bill to the deceased mother, which the Energy Ombudsman cancelled. Despite the cancellation, the £3,360 debt remains, and the company’s confusing billing and meter issues have left the customer in doubt."
