title: "Climate change fuels crop pests, threatening global food"
summary: "Climate change is making crop pests more common. Scientists say that when the planet warms by 2 °C, pest damage could rise by 46 % for wheat, 19 % for rice and 31 % for maize. Heat lets insects breed faster, survive longer and move into cooler areas. As a result, farmers could lose 6‑10 % of yields for every degree the world heats up. To protect food, experts recommend more crop variety and protecting natural predators instead of only chemicals."
