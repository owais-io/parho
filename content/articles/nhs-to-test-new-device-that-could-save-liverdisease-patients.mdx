title: "NHS to test new device that could save liver‑disease patients"
summary: "The NHS will start a trial of a new blood‑cleansing machine called Dialive in 13 hospitals. The device is aimed at people with acute‑on‑chronic liver failure, a severe form of liver disease that often kills within a month. Seventy‑two patients will be randomly assigned to receive Dialive or usual care. The hope is the machine can lower death rates and help more patients recover without a transplant."
