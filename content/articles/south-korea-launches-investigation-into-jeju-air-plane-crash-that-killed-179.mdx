title: "South Korea Launches Investigation Into Jeju Air Plane Crash That Killed 179"
summary: "South Korea’s parliament has created a 40‑day independent inquiry into the deadly Jeju Air crash that killed 179 people. The Boeing 737‑800 crashed after a bird strike at Muan airport, hitting a concrete embankment and burning. Families say the official investigation by the aviation board is biased because it reports to the transport ministry that also runs the airport. The new committee will probe bird‑strike handling, aircraft faults, the embankment and any government cover‑ups."
