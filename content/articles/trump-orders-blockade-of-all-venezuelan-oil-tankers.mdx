title: "Trump orders blockade of all Venezuelan oil tankers"
summary: "Trump has ordered a full blockade of every Venezuelan oil tanker that is under U.S. sanctions. He says the move will stop oil from helping drug trafficking and will add more U.S. warships to the area. Venezuela calls the order illegal and “piracy,” while some U.S. lawmakers warn it looks like an unapproved war. Oil prices have risen because some Venezuelan barrels may no longer leave the country. The U.S. keeps pushing to oust President Maduro."
