title: "UK government sides with builders over new home energy rules"
summary: "The UK government is being accused of giving in to house builders’ lobbying. New rules would limit local councils from pushing higher energy‑efficiency standards in homes. The Future Homes Standard would set performance targets instead of specific tech like heat pumps or solar panels, making it easier for builders to cut costs. Critics say this will hurt households and slow progress on zero‑carbon homes, while developers gain certainty and lower costs."
