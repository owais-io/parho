title: "China’s Major Snow Season: People Hope for Heavy Snowfall"
summary: "In China’s calendar, Major Snow lasts from Dec 7 to 21. Heavy snow is welcomed because a proverb says it brings a better harvest next year. Families eat red‑bean porridge on the first day and other “black” foods like black sesame, black beans, black rice and shiitake mushrooms. It’s also the time for pickling meat for winter. The middle of the term is seen as the coldest part of the year, when tigers mate, buds start to sprout."
