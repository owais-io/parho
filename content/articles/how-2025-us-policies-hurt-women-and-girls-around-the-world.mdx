title: "How 2025 US Policies Hurt Women and Girls Around the World"
summary: "In 2025, the US rolled out a wave of executive orders that weakened aid to women’s rights. USAID was frozen and later dismantled, cutting 83 % of programmes, sparking global outrage. The US also threatened to destroy contraceptives, expanded the “global gag rule” to NGOs, governments and diversity groups, and joined anti‑abortion coalitions. These moves hurt maternal care, family planning and gender equality, especially in conflict zones. International partners and NGOs protested, warning of many deaths and lost services."
