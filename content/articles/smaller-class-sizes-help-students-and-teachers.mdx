title: "Smaller class sizes help students and teachers"
summary: "During the 2021 lockdown a teacher’s class shrank to 18 students, allowing one‑on‑one help and richer projects. Teachers and former inspectors say small classes let kids learn better, especially those with special needs. But smaller groups cost more, and politicians often ignore the evidence. The article argues the benefits outweigh the extra cost, urging policymakers to admit that fewer pupils help everyone thrive."
