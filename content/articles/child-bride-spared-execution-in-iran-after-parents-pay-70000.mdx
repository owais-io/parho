title: "Child bride spared execution in Iran after parents pay £70,000"
summary: "Goli Kouhkan, 25, a child bride from Iran’s Baluch minority, was on death row for killing her abusive husband. The sentence would be carried out unless her parents paid about £70,000 in “blood money”. They raised the money, and the execution was stopped. The case shows how Iran’s revenge‑law lets families decide who lives or dies, exposing the risks of child marriage and domestic abuse. International pressure helped."
