title: "Thinktank Says AI News Must Show Sources"
summary: "A UK think‑tank says AI‑generated news should have clear labels that show what sources were used, and that tech firms should pay newspapers for the content they scrape. The IPPR recommends a licensing system so publishers can negotiate deals with AI companies, and it highlights the risk of big sites like Google and OpenAI pushing small local papers to the sidelines. It also calls for new funding to keep investigative journalism alive."
