title: "Mother‑Son Influencer Duo Spreads Wrong Somali Daycare Fraud Claims"
summary: "Nick and Brooke Shirley, a mother‑son pair of YouTube and TikTok creators, spread a false story that Somali‑run daycares in Minnesota were fraudulently collecting government money. Their video went viral before a federal funding freeze and was amplified by Trump supporters. Investigations found no evidence of fraud, and the daycares had no such violations. The duo’s content is tied to Republican and anti‑immigrant circles and is part of a larger trend of “citizen journalism” that often spreads misinformation."
