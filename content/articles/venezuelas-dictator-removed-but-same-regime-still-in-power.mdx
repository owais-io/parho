title: "Venezuela’s Dictator Removed, but Same Regime Still in Power"
summary: "After the U.S. captured Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela still runs under the same officials. Acting president Delcy Rodríguez keeps most of the old cabinet, claiming Washington will oversee it. Repression continues, with raids and many political prisoners. Protesters want new elections or to install Edmundo González, who many say won 2024, but the U.S. isn’t acting on it. Activists face arrest, NGOs are restricted, so the future is uncertain."
