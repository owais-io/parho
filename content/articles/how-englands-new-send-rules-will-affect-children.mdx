title: "How England’s New SEND Rules Will Affect Children"
summary: "England’s big change to special‑education rules starts in 2030 and will hit kids differently depending on their age. Kids already on a special plan (EHCP) in special schools can stay there, but schools will face new fee limits that could pull some providers out. Primary‑school kids with EHCPs will shift to new “individual support plans” (ISPs), giving less legal protection. New students will get clearer support choices and inclusion bases in mainstream schools."
