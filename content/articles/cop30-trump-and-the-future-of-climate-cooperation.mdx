title: "COP30, Trump, and the Future of Climate Cooperation"
summary: "At COP30, the world tried to keep climate talks going, but the US under Trump left out of the meeting and threatened other nations. The agreement was weak, failing to set real cuts for fossil fuels, and the EU’s new carbon border tax sparked anger from developing countries. With COP31 coming in 2026, many worry multilateral cooperation will struggle. The piece stresses that teamwork—rather than countries acting alone—is still the only realistic way to fight climate change."
