title: "London gambling ads cost almost £5m after mayor’s ban promise"
summary: "London gambling ads cost almost £5m since 2021, when Mayor Sadiq Khan promised a ban. Firms have run over 500 campaigns on buses, tubes and trams, spending £4.6m, but the mayor hasn’t acted because the national government hasn’t provided guidance on how gambling ads harm people. Ads have doubled this year, and council groups are calling for a ban, while the mayor says he’ll wait for a review that may never happen."
