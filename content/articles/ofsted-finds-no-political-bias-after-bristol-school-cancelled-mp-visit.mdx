title: "Ofsted finds no political bias after Bristol school cancelled MP visit"
summary: "Ofsted looked at Bristol Brunel Academy after it cancelled a visit by Labour MP Damien Egan, who is Jewish and in a pro‑Israel group. The school said it pulled the event because some staff and union members worried about a protest over Gaza. Inspectors spent two days checking the school’s policies, culture and teaching. They found no political bias and said staff and parents were overwhelmingly supportive of the school’s inclusive, tolerant environment."
