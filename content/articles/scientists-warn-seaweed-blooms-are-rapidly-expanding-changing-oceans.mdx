title: "Scientists Warn Seaweed Blooms Are Rapidly Expanding, Changing Oceans"
summary: "Seaweed mats are spreading faster than ever, scientists say. They used AI to scan 1.2 million satellite photos from 2003‑2022 and found blooms grew 13.4% each year. The rise is linked to warmer seas and nutrient pollution from farming. The change, starting around 2008, means oceans are moving from few seaweed patches to many, which could alter light, carbon capture and the climate. It could hurt fishing, beaches and the global climate."
