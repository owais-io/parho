title: "Labour’s trail‑hunting ban plan is seen as pushing rural communities away, says Countryside Alliance"
summary: "The Countryside Alliance says Labour’s move to ban trail hunting alienates rural people. Their poll shows 65 % think the government ignores country life. Trail hunting, where hounds follow a scent instead of a live animal, is part of a new animal‑welfare strategy. Critics say the ban hides illegal fox‑hunting. The government stands by the ban and has made some tax changes for farms, but rural groups feel sidelined."
