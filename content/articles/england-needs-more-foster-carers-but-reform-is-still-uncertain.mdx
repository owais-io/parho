title: "England Needs More Foster Carers, but Reform Is Still Uncertain"
summary: "England’s foster care system is still under pressure. The government plans to add 10,000 non‑profit foster places by 2029, launch a national recruitment drive, and give grants to help carers update homes. But private providers’ high profits and weak leadership remain concerns. The plan also aims to improve support for carers, speed up approvals, and reduce frequent changes of social workers. Without firm action on costs and better management, the system may stay fragile."
