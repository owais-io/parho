title: "Four Reasons the UK Economy Might Improve in 2026"
summary: "The UK economy struggled in 2025, but four hopeful signs point to improvement in 2026. First, the Treasury has more room and won’t be tightly checked against strict rules, giving a calmer budget. Business confidence is rising, with the PMI above 50 and firms hiring again. Second, lower bank rates and a £150 energy‑bill cut could lift household spending. Finally, productivity rose 1 % in early 2025, hinting technology and AI might boost growth."
