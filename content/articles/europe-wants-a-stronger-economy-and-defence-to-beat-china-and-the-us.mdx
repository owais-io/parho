title: "Europe Wants a Stronger Economy and Defence to Beat China and the U.S."
summary: "European leaders say the continent must act faster and bigger on its economy and defence. They warn that China is becoming a low‑cost, high‑tech competitor and that the U.S. may not always support Europe. Meetings in Belgium and the Munich Security Conference aim to cut red tape, boost investment and raise defence spending. A recent poll shows most Europeans want more autonomy, but different groups hold mixed views on the U.S. and the EU."
