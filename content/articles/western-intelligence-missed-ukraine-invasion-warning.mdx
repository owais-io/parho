title: "Western Intelligence Missed Ukraine Invasion Warning"
summary: "US and UK intelligence had clear clues that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine, yet their warnings were ignored or dismissed. The article likens this to the U.S. missing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, blaming a tendency to see only what is expected. It also criticises Britain’s handling of Ukrainian refugees, offering no long‑term status and forcing them to renew their stay every 18 months. The piece urges better diplomacy and intelligence to prevent future wars."
