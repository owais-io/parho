title: "How May 2026 Elections Could Change UK Politics"
summary: "The May 2026 local, Scottish, and Welsh elections will test the two biggest UK parties. Labour and the Conservatives risk losing many council seats as the Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and the Greens gain. In Scotland the SNP could win a clear majority, while Plaid Cymru is set to make big gains in Wales, possibly pushing Labour into opposition. The results will show how devolution is reshaping politics, with regional parties growing stronger and Westminster’s dominance shrinking."
