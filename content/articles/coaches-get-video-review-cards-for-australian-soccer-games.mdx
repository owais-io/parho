title: "Coaches Get Video Review Cards for Australian Soccer Games"
summary: "Coaches in Australia’s Championship will get two video‑review cards for normal time and a third for extra‑time. They can hand a card to the fourth official or wave to request a replay of goals, penalty calls or cards. The lightweight system, tried in Malta, Spain and Italy, may be used in the A‑League Women finals. Referees will watch for gamesmanship, and the system is not a full VAR replacement. If it fails, play continues."
