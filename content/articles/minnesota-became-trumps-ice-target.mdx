title: "Minnesota Became Trump’s ICE Target"
summary: "Trump’s ICE operation in Minnesota was a political hit‑list move. The state’s liberal politics, high civic engagement, large immigrant communities and progressive reforms made it a symbol of opposition to the Trump agenda. Thousands of agents raided neighborhoods, detained immigrants (most with no criminal record), arrested protesters, and pursued lawsuits. Minnesota’s strong community response and legal pushback highlighted the clash between federal enforcement and local democracy."
