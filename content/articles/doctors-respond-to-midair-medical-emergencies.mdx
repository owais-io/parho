title: "Doctors Respond to Midair Medical Emergencies"
summary: "Doctors on planes face pressure when a midair medical call comes in. The story starts with 1995 British Airways, where two surgeons improvised a chest‑tube to save a passenger. It then moves to Australia, where doctors describe how airlines carry kits but no standard set. Airlines now load more tools like Narcan and defibrillators, but doctors still worry about legal liability and lack of training for the high‑altitude setting."
