title: "City minister says banks can dodge £2bn tax on car‑loan payouts"
summary: "A City minister, Lucy Rigby, told a Treasury committee that banks linked to an £11bn car loan scandal can avoid paying £2bn in corporation tax on compensation payouts because their motor‑finance arms are not counted as banks. She said the rule that stops banks from deducting such payouts was not applied to companies inside banking groups that aren’t classified as banks. Critics say this lets big banks escape tax, hurting taxpayers."
