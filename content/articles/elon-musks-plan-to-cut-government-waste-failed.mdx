title: "Elon Musk’s plan to cut government waste failed"
summary: "Elon Musk, who spent over $250 million on President Trump’s 2024 campaign, was put in charge of a new agency called Doge to cut waste from the federal government. Musk promised up to $2 trillion in savings, but the plan led to thousands of jobs being fired, agencies scrambling, and many of the claimed cuts turned out to be wrong or exaggerated. After a few months, Musk quit, and Doge was shut down. Critics say the effort caused chaos without real benefit."
