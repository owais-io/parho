title: "UN says climate battle is still on, but COP30’s results are modest"
summary: "The UN climate chief said the world hasn’t won the climate battle, but the fight is on. At COP30 in Brazil, 194 countries made a deal, but it fell short on big promises, like ending fossil‑fuel use and stopping Amazon deforestation. The conference kept some hopes alive, such as triple adaptation money and a plan for just transition, and it recognized indigenous peoples’ rights. The U.S. stayed out, and many feel the agreement isn’t strong enough, but meeting didn’t collapse."
