title: "Are Microplastics Really in Our Bodies?"
summary: "Recent studies said microplastics were found in our brains, placentas and more, but new research questions those results. Scientists say the tests may have mixed up fat for plastic, creating false positives. Measuring tiny plastic particles in the body is hard, and the field is still new. While microplastics are everywhere in the environment, the extreme levels reported in some studies are likely wrong. The real risk is still unclear."
