title: "Kenyan men tricked into fighting for Russia"
summary: "A wave of Kenyan and other African men were lured to Russia with promises of ordinary jobs. They arrived in St. Petersburg, had their luggage taken, were fingerprinted and signed Russian‑language papers, then conscripted into the army. After training, they were sent to the Ukraine front, often without weapons training and used for dangerous missions. Many have returned home wounded; others remain missing. Kenya is now working to bring survivors back."
