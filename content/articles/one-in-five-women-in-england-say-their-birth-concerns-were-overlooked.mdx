title: "One in Five Women in England Say Their Birth Concerns Were Overlooked"
summary: "A recent survey of 17,000 NHS mothers found that 18% felt their worries during labour were not taken seriously, and 15% said they didn’t get proper advice early on. About 10% were left alone when they needed help, especially in the final stages of labour. Only 57% got help right after birth, and 10% got none. Despite these problems, 89% of women said they were spoken to clearly and were offered mental‑health support. The findings have prompted urgent calls for better listening, more staff and daily reviews of maternity care."
