title: "UK Bible sales hit record high as young people seek faith"
summary: "In 2025, the UK saw record Bible sales, up 134% since 2019, reaching £6.3 million. The jump is mainly due to young people without a Christian background who are searching for meaning. Influencers such as Jordan Peterson and social‑media posts spark interest, and many of these readers later visit churches. Church attendance has also risen, especially among 18‑ to 24‑year‑olds, and men are more likely to attend. Some worry about Christian nationalism, but the sales trend predates that."
