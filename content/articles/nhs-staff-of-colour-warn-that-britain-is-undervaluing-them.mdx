title: "NHS Staff of Colour Warn That Britain Is Undervaluing Them"
summary: "Many Black, ethnic‑minority and overseas NHS workers say they feel unappreciated and face racism. They point to a steep drop in foreign nurses, higher reports of hate incidents and more doctors leaving the country. This loss threatens the NHS’s ability to run. The staff stress that their history of building the service is ignored, and that better pay abroad drives many to quit. They warn the NHS could collapse if this trend continues."
