title: "DWP Chief Blames Carers for Allowance Debt Crisis"
summary: "Neil Couling, a senior DWP official, wrote an internal note blaming carers for the carer's allowance debt crisis. An independent review says the real fault is the Department’s confusing rules and long‑standing leadership failures. Carers have been hit with huge debts and some have even considered suicide. The government will re‑look 200,000 cases, likely canceling or reducing 26,000 debts, and has apologized for the mess."
