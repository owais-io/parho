title: "UK’s weak plan to tackle forever chemicals slammed by environmental groups"
summary: "Environmental groups say the UK government’s new plan to stop “forever chemicals” (Pfas) is too weak. The plan focuses on testing, monitoring and setting limits, but it misses strong bans and clean‑up that other European countries have already started. Pfas, used in many products, can stay in the environment for thousands of years, causing health and wildlife problems. Critics urge the government to act faster and ban more products."
