title: "England plans a million‑person “forest city” of wooden homes"
summary: "A group led by Shiv Malik plans a ‘forest city’ near Cambridge that could house a million people. It would offer wooden homes for about £350,000 each inside a 12,000‑acre nature reserve. The city would be run by a community land trust, focus on walking and trams, and grow green spaces instead of cars. Politicians and nature groups back it, but it must overcome water‑scarcity, land‑use and planning challenges."
