title: "UK Mulls Banning Social Media for Children Under 16"
summary: "A vote in the UK House of Lords approved a ban on social media for children under 16, a move that could change how kids use the internet. The decision follows a report on Australia’s similar rule, but the government is still debating it. Parents, teachers and teens say the ban would protect children from harmful content and help focus at school, though some worry it might be hard to enforce or cut off useful social links."
