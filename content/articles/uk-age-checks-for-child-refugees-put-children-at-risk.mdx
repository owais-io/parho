title: "UK Age Checks for Child Refugees Put Children at Risk"
summary: "A coalition of more than 100 refugee‑support groups says the Home Office’s new age‑assessment board is harming child refugees. The board, which uses social workers to decide if young asylum seekers are children or adults, can misjudge ages, leading to children being put in adult housing or prisons. The report argues the process is traumatic, inconsistent, and should be replaced by local‑authority checks that protect children."
