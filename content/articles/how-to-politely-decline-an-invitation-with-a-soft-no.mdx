title: "How to politely decline an invitation with a “soft no”"
summary: "Sometimes we get asked to hang out one‑on‑one after a group night. Saying a straight “no” can feel rude, and a simple “maybe” can leave us stuck. The article explains the “soft no,” a gentle, indirect way to decline. It’s not a lie, just a vague reply that delays the decision and keeps the other person from feeling rejected. The trick is to say something like “I’m not sure this week” and let it slip away."
