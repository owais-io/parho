title: "Health unions call NHS pay rise an insult"
summary: "Health unions say the government's 3.3% pay rise for 1.4 million NHS staff is an insult and will not match rising living costs. They say it is below last month's inflation of 3.4% and cuts real wages. The unions want a higher increase and threaten strikes. The government said 3.3% is above the 2.2% inflation forecast for 2026‑27, but unions reject the offer."
