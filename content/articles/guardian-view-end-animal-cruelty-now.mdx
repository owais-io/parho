title: "Guardian View: End Animal Cruelty Now"
summary: "England’s new animal welfare plan aims to stop cruel farm practices like hen cages and pig crates, replace harsh pig stunning, and protect fish and hares. It also tackles trail hunting, snare traps, and gives pets more rights. The government promises support for farmers affected by higher standards and plans stricter rules for breeders, but enforcement will be key. The goal: treat animals with compassion and keep laws up to date."
