title: "Trump’s plan to leave the US from a major UN climate treaty could be illegal"
summary: "President Trump announced the US would pull out of the UN climate treaty, the first time a country has tried to leave. Many legal experts say he doesn't have the power to do that unilaterally because the treaty was approved by the Senate. They warn it could be illegal and that courts might sue the administration. Re‑joining would likely need Senate approval again."
