title: "Why Taking Strip Photos with Friends Is Still Special"
summary: "Last New Year’s Eve, I and a friend wandered around town, stopped at a photo booth, and made a strip of silly black‑and‑white pictures. I kept that strip on my fridge. Years later, I found more old pictures in a box and started putting all the strip photos together. I now bring friends to booths to add more snapshots. These tiny photos keep the feeling of being together alive, unlike quick phone shots."
