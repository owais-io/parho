title: "Longevity supplements: Do they really help you live longer?"
summary: "Many supplements promise to boost the body’s NAD levels and slow ageing. Marketing highlights ingredients like NR, NMN, and TMG, and claims big percentage increases in a few weeks. But scientists say these boosts don’t prove health gains. Few human trials exist, and they only show tiny short‑term energy changes. Large studies that would show fewer heart attacks or longer life are missing. The real way to stay healthy is a balanced diet, exercise, sleep, stress control, and regular check‑ups."
