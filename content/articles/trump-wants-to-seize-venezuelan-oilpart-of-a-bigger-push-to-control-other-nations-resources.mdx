title: "Trump Wants to Seize Venezuelan Oil—Part of a Bigger Push to Control Other Nations’ Resources"
summary: "Trump says the U.S. should keep Venezuelan oil that has been seized from tankers, and he’s also wanted to take oil from other countries, Iran, Greenland, and even Ukraine’s minerals. Experts call this “resource imperialism,” a pattern of using force or sanctions to control other nations’ resources. The move mirrors past U.S. tactics but is more openly aggressive, and critics warn it hurts climate goals and international trust."
