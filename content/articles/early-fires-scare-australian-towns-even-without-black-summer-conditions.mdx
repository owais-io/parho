summary: "This winter, Australian towns are experiencing a wave of bushfires that have frightened residents even though the conditions aren't as extreme as the 2019‑20 'black summer'. Fires in New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia have damaged dozens of homes and killed firefighters. The heat, low rain and wind‑driven sparks make the countryside drier. Experts say this kind of risk will happen more often because of climate change, so people are urged to stay alert."
