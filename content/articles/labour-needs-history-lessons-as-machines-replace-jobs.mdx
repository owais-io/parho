title: "Labour Needs History Lessons as Machines Replace Jobs"
summary: "Retail shops are getting more tech – from self‑checkout machines to AI cameras – and this is pushing out low‑pay jobs. Britain’s unemployment has risen while productivity climbs because machines replace workers, especially in retail. Higher costs for wages and taxes make companies lean on automation. History shows big tech shifts can hurt workers, but new jobs can appear if people get new skills. Labour should learn from the past and help workers retrain."
