title: "Reform UK’s Rapid Rise Reveals How Fragile It Really Is"
summary: "Reform UK has grown fast, but that speed hides weak foundations. Its plans—like turning empty churches into schools—have faced criticism and new problems. The party has also dealt with accusations of racism and a jailed former leader who took bribes from Russia. As Reform pulls more former Conservative voters, it’s under more scrutiny and facing questions about foreign influence and national sovereignty. The government is now learning to hold it accountable."
