title: "Why the Democrats are keeping their 2024 election review hidden"
summary: "The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has decided not to share its own review of why Democrats lost the 2024 election. The DNC says the report would distract from winning the next race, but critics say it’s hiding mistakes. The report would explain problems like losing voters, Biden staying in the race, and the campaign’s handling of Israel‑Gaza. By keeping the findings secret, the party may repeat the same errors and lose future support."
