title: "England's Smart Motorways Are Poor Value, Reports Show"
summary: "An independent review found most of England’s smart motorways—roads where the hard shoulder is turned into a running lane—offer poor value. Of 11 schemes tested, only two were rated good; the rest were poor or very poor. The projects cost £2.3bn (2010 prices) and have mixed safety records, with some fatal accidents on breakdowns. Drivers are uneasy, and the AA says keeping the hard shoulder works best. The government says they add capacity and safety, but the data is mixed."
