title: "Only 1 in 10 teenage boys in the UK read books daily"
summary: "A recent study by the National Literacy Trust found that less than one in ten boys aged 14‑16 in the UK read books every day. Reading drops for both boys and girls as they get older, but boys’ rates are especially low. Most teens say schoolwork, screens and sports take up their time, leaving little space for books. The report urges schools, media and parents to help teens find books that fit their interests."
