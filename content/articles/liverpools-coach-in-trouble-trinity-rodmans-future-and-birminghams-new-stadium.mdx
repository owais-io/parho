summary: "Liverpool are losing games and falling behind the top, so fans are worried Arne Slot might lose his job. Trinity Rodman, who only played a cameo in the NWSL final, could leave for Europe or the new USL league, which would shake up the U.S. women’s soccer scene and force the NWSL to rethink its salary rules. Birmingham City’s huge new stadium, called The Powerhouse, is being built with AI‑generated designs, and many think it will look tacky."
