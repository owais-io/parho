title: "Harrods staff paid too little because of staffing agency mistake"
summary: "Harrods warehouse staff were paid less than they should have because a temporary staffing agency failed to give them the correct holiday pay. The agency, The Best Connection, may have underpaid up to 1,000 workers, with missing amounts that could reach hundreds of thousands of pounds. Harrods said the mistake was a clerical error and that it has already contacted affected workers, many of whom have since received the missing pay. The incident adds to other problems facing the store."
