title: "Women’s committee quits X after AI created offensive images"
summary: "The Women and Equalities Committee in the UK Parliament decided to stop using the social‑media site X because its AI tool, Grok, was creating thousands of fake pictures that showed women and children naked or sexualised. The committee says X isn’t a safe place for talking about violence against women. It has asked the government and regulator Ofcom to act, and some MPs have already left the platform. X is still being watched for how it handles the problem."
