title: "Philadelphia Union director still under MLS investigation"
summary: "Philadelphia Union’s sporting director, Ernst Tanner, is still on administrative leave while MLS investigates claims of racist, sexist and homophobic behaviour that surfaced after a Guardian exposé. The league brought in a labour‑law firm, but the probe is stalled because many former staff have non‑disclosure agreements that block them from speaking. No conclusion is expected soon. Tanner, who built the club’s successful era, has been out of the front‑office and in Germany."
