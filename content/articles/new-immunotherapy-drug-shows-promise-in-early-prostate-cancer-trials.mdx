title: "New Immunotherapy Drug Shows Promise in Early Prostate Cancer Trials"
summary: "A new immunotherapy drug called VIR‑5500 is showing encouraging results in early tests for men with advanced prostate cancer. In a first‑stage study of 58 patients, most had only mild side effects, and those on the highest dose saw their PSA levels drop by half, 90% or almost all. Five of 11 people with measurable tumors shrank, and one man’s liver cancer disappeared after six cycles. The research is still early, but it offers hope for a tough‑to‑treat disease."
