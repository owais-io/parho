title: "Why the Willow Might Be Britain’s Best Tree"
summary: "Willows may not be the tallest trees, but they’re a huge win for wildlife. Over 450 insect species live on them—more than on oak—and about 160 lichens call willows home. Their early‑spring flowers feed bugs, and the aphids that swarm on them give birds protein all summer. With roughly 20 native types and many hybrids, a single willow can be a tiny, living ecosystem. The writer loves a nearby stand that shelters deer and provides a quiet refuge for birds."
