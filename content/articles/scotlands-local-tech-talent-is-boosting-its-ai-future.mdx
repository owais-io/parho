title: "Scotland’s local tech talent is boosting its AI future"
summary: "Scotland is investing in AI with a £1 million grant to help small businesses, and a new national AI program set to launch in 2026. The country already hosts over 11,000 tech firms and 76,000 tech jobs, thanks to strong universities and a high quality of life that draws talent away from places like London. Edinburgh‑based Wordsmith AI shows how local talent and lower costs can grow a company to a $100 million valuation and win big clients such as BT and Skyscanner. Scottish government, the UK government and private investors give grants and help start‑ups reach the market, while easy travel from Edinburgh Airport keeps overseas customers connected."
