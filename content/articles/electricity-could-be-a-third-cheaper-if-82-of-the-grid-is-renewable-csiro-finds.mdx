title: "Electricity could be a third cheaper if 82% of the grid is renewable, CSIRO finds"
summary: "A recent CSIRO study says that if 82% of Australia’s power comes from renewables, wholesale electricity would drop by a third, from $129 to $91 per megawatt hour. The model shows a 2050 grid could be almost all renewable without extra costs. CSIRO still sees gas, not hydrogen, as the cheapest backup, and warns that adding offshore wind or nuclear raises prices. Battery prices are falling. This counters claims that renewables hike bills."
