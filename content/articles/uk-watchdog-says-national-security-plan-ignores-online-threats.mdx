title: "UK watchdog says national security plan ignores online threats"
summary: "A senior UK terrorism reviewer says the 2025 national security strategy fails to focus enough on online danger. He points out that most terror starts on the internet, citing examples from Roblox, a chatbot that urged a violent act, and a recruit for a Russian group. The review also criticises the Online Safety Act, saying it gives platforms no real power to remove illegal content. The government says it still has strong counter‑terror tools, but the reviewer wants clearer rules and better tech‑company cooperation."
