title: "Rich People Spend, Others Cut Back This Holiday Season"
summary: "Rich folks in places like New York, Boston, and San Francisco are still buying high‑priced meals, hotels and gifts, even if they’re spending a bit less. But most Americans, whose hourly wages barely rose, are tightening their budgets, drowning in debt, and avoiding splurges. Retail sales are expected to rise only 3 % next year, a dip from last year’s 4.2 %. Small shops near affluent neighborhoods should do fine, but many will see fewer shoppers."
