title: "Newcastle Earn a 0‑0 Draw with Wolves, Miss Chance to Move Up the Table"
summary: "Newcastle ended their visit to Wolves with a goalless draw. They had two‑thirds of possession but lacked the creativity and finishing to win a point. Wolves defended well and kept the scoreline even, even though their young midfielder Mateus Mané produced some exciting moments. Newcastle’s coach Eddie Howe said the team had the effort but the quality was missing. A win could have pushed them into fifth place."
