title: "Plaid Cymru’s Rise Signals Major Change in Welsh Politics"
summary: "Plaid Cymru’s leader Rhun ap Iorwerth says the party wants to replace Labour in Wales, not just act as its conscience. After winning a by‑election from Labour, Plaid is riding a surge of Welsh‑first identity and promises like free childcare. The May election is seen as a chance to become the main voice for Welsh interests, possibly setting the stage for more regional moves toward independence. Meanwhile, Labour’s scandals and weak performance have opened the door for Plaid’s rise."
