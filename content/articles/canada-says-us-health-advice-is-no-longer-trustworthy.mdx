title: "Canada says U.S. health advice is no longer trustworthy"
summary: "Canada’s health officials say U.S. health agencies like the CDC are no longer reliable, especially after the Trump‑era administration spread anti‑vaccine messages. The U.S. removed a hepatitis‑B vaccine recommendation for newborns and added false claims about autism. Canada lost its measles‑elimination status after a 5,000‑case spike and is fighting rising vaccine hesitancy. Experts say Canada should lead its own public‑health system instead of relying on U.S. guidance."
