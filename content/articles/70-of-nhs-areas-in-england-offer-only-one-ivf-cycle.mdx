title: "70% of NHS Areas in England Offer Only One IVF Cycle"
summary: "A study by the Progress Educational Trust shows that almost 70% of NHS local areas in England now pay for just one round of IVF for women under 40 who have tried to conceive for two years. Official guidance says three full cycles should be offered, but many boards cut the service, making the one NHS‑funded cycle the only affordable option for many. The uneven rollout is likened to a “postcode lottery.”"
