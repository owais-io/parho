title: "Surgeon Says Pig Kidneys Could Replace Human Donors"
summary: "Dr. Robert Montgomery, a leading transplant surgeon, says pig kidneys could someday replace human ones. He’s already done a trial with a gene‑edited pig kidney and plans more if the FDA clears it. Six patients will get the pig organs first; the trial could grow to 44 more. The hope is to solve the huge shortage of human kidneys, and pig organs might even be better because they can be continually improved."
