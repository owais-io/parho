title: "UK Plans to End Most Animal Testing by 2035"
summary: "The UK will cut the use of animals in research, aiming to stop tests like the forced‑swim experiment and reduce eye and skin toxicity studies. The government will replace these with lab‑grown “organ‑on‑a‑chip” models and AI, backed by £60 m in funding. While many labs still use rodents for cancer research, the plan seeks to show that newer methods work just as well, sparing millions of animals and saving money. That would meet both science and moral goals."
