title: "Australia Risks Missing Clean Energy Target as Solar and Wind Investment Slows"
summary: "Australia’s aim to get most of its electricity from clean sources is in danger. Solar and wind projects are getting far fewer investment deals than last year, the lowest in almost ten years. Experts blame long planning approvals, grid problems, high costs and uncertain earnings. Even with a government support scheme, companies are still hesitant. To meet the 82 % clean‑energy target by 2030, Australia must double the pace of new projects."
