title: "Trump Accuses Maryland Governor of Mishandling Potomac Sewage Spill"
summary: "After a huge sewage spill hit the Potomac River last month, President Trump blamed Maryland Gov. Wes Moore for a pipeline failure that actually falls under federal control. The governor’s team says the 1960s‑era Potomac Interceptor pipe is run by DC Water and overseen by the EPA, not state officials. Trump has even ordered FEMA to lead cleanup, despite the agency being unfunded because of a government shutdown. The feud highlights wider tensions between the two leaders."
