title: "Trump Builds War Machine for Iran Without Explaining Why"
summary: "President Trump has moved a large US military fleet near Iran, ready to strike if needed, but he has not explained why. Unlike Bush, who used false weapons claims to justify the Iraq war, Trump's case is vague. He withdrew Iran from the nuclear deal, raising tensions. Most Americans now oppose foreign wars, and Trump’s speeches give little detail on his goals. Analysts warn this could spark a costly conflict."
