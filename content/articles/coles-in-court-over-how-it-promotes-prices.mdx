title: "Coles in Court Over How It Promotes Prices"
summary: "Australian regulators are suing Coles for using “Down Down” price ads that may trick shoppers. The case argues Coles set temporary high “was” prices, then lowered them for a short period, making discounts look bigger than they are. The court heard evidence that many products were only on the “was” price for a few weeks, and that discounts may not be genuine. The outcome could change how big supermarkets advertise prices."
