title: "NSW Koala Survey Finds 274,000 Animals, but Numbers May Not Mean Population Growth"
summary: "A statewide survey in New South Wales used drones and sound recorders to count koalas and came up with 274,000 – higher than the earlier 15,000–30,000 estimate. The new numbers are from better tools and a bigger search, not from a population boom. Experts say the figures are just a baseline and don’t show real growth. Some areas still have almost no koalas, and threats like habitat loss, disease and cars remain serious."
