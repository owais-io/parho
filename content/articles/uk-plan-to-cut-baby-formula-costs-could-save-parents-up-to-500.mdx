title: "UK plan to cut baby formula costs could save parents up to £500"
summary: "The UK government will change rules so parents can buy cheaper baby formula. New rules let all formula brands be shown together in stores and let parents use gift cards, vouchers, loyalty points and coupons to pay. The plan follows the removal of a two‑child benefit cap and aims to cut costs by up to £500 in the first year of a child’s life. It also stops some marketing tactics in hospitals."
