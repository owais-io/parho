title: "UK Food Shortages Could Lead to Chaos – A Call for Food Reserves"
summary: "The author argues that the UK should keep large food reserves because wars, trade disputes or global shortages could leave people without food, causing economic collapse and chaos. Our country’s ability to grow its own food has dropped from 78% in 1984 to about 62% today, and farmland is shrinking as land is turned into housing, solar farms, woods, and wildlife areas. Other nations prioritize feeding people over other land uses, so the UK should act now."
