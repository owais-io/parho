title: "Vålerenga urges tougher doping rules after player tests positive from artificial turf"
summary: "A Vålerenga women's player tested positive for a banned stimulant after playing on an artificial pitch. Tests traced the drug to rubber crumb in the turf, not her diet or supplements. The case ended with the World Anti‑Doping Agency not appealing, and the player was cleared of fault. Vålerenga now urges stronger rules that recognise environmental contamination, as synthetic pitches are common across Europe."
