title: "Court Challenges UK Ban on Palestine Action Protest Group"
summary: "The court is hearing a challenge to the UK ban on the Palestine Action protest group. Lawyers say the ban unfairly hits free speech, noting the group mainly does non‑violent direct action. The home secretary says the ban is needed because some members cross into terrorism. The case could affect over 2,000 people arrested for holding anti‑Israel signs. A prisoner on a hunger strike was hospitalised, and doctors have asked NHS to intervene."
