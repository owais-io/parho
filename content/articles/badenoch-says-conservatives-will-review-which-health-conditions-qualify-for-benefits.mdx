title: "Badenoch says Conservatives will review which health conditions qualify for benefits"
summary: "Kemi Badenoch said the Conservative Party will look into tightening the benefits system because the number of people claiming for low‑level mental conditions has become too costly. The review could cut the range of illnesses that count as a disability, make some payments temporary, and even drop the use of “relative poverty” as a measure of need. Badenoch said the changes aim to keep the economy stable and reduce what she sees as abuse of the system."
