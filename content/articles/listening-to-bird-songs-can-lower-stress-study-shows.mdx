title: "Listening to Bird Songs Can Lower Stress, Study Shows"
summary: "A new study shows that listening to bird songs while walking in a park can lower stress markers like blood pressure, heart rate, and cortisol. Researchers set up loudspeakers with rare bird calls and compared groups that heard those songs, natural bird sounds, or no sound. All participants saw improvements, but paying close attention to the birdsong made the biggest drop. Even a simple walk helped, so listening to birds might be a simple health boost."
