summary: "The Guardian apologises for a handful of printing errors. In a piece about musician Chris Rea, we mis‑named a Middlesbrough district; a photo story about new‑year swimmers got the Scottish river name wrong. We also noted Addison Rae’s single came out in 2021, not 2023. Other small mistakes in various articles have been corrected. Readers can send complaints to guardian.readers@theguardian.com."
