title: "Wales May Lose Its Long‑Standing Labour Stronghold in the May Election"
summary: "Labour’s grip on Wales is slipping as polls show it could drop to third or fourth place in the May Senedd election. Voters blame poor public services and a perceived over‑expansion of the Welsh government. Plaid Cymru, the Greens and Reform UK are rising, with Plaid looking close to a majority and the Greens already ahead of Labour. If the polls stay, Wales could see a minority Plaid‑led government, a shock for Prime Minister Starmer."
