title: "Trump’s bid to control the Fed could raise Australian inflation"
summary: "If Trump succeeds in taking control of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Australia’s central bank may lose its independence. Experts warn that a politically‑run Fed could keep U.S. interest rates low, which would strengthen the dollar and force the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut its own rates, boosting inflation. The move would also set a dangerous precedent for other countries. The U.S. Supreme Court is still deciding if the president can fire a Fed governor."
