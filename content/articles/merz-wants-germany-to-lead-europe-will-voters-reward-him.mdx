title: "Merz Wants Germany to Lead Europe – Will Voters Reward Him?"
summary: "German leader Friedrich Merz pushed a bold plan to use Russia’s frozen bank assets to help Ukraine, but Brussels rejected it. Instead Ukraine will get a €90 bn loan from the EU. Merz still wants Germany to be a European power, backing stronger defence and talking with the US. He faces criticism from other European leaders and a divided German public, who may not back his grand ideas. His bold moves could backfire in elections."
