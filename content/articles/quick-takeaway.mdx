title: "**Quick take‑away**"
summary: "- **ICE shooting in Minneapolis**     An ICE officer shot and killed a U.S. citizen named Renee Good. Videos show her in the car, and the officer seemed unharmed.     Democrats say the video does not prove “self‑defense” and want the case to be investigated properly.   - **Democratic lawmakers’ reaction**     Senators and the Minnesota governor called for reforms that would put more limits on ICE officers, such as needing a warrant and banning them from wearing masks.   - **Trump’s social media posts**     Trump said he cancelled a “second wave” of attacks on Venezuela after the U.S. seized its president, Maduro. He claims the move was because Venezuela is releasing many prisoners and working on oil.   - **Supreme Court “decision day”**     The Court may decide whether the Trump administration can set tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. No decision has been announced yet.   - **Venezuela and oil**     Trump said he will meet big oil companies at the White House and invest $100 billion in Venezuelan oil.     Venezuela also announced the release of many political prisoners, but it is unclear if this will lead to a peace deal.   - **Russia on seized tanker**     Russia says the U.S. seized a Russian‑flagged oil tanker that was carrying oil to countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia. Russia released two crew members, but says the seizure is a big problem.   - **Other border incidents**     In Portland, Oregon, two people were shot by border patrol agents after a vehicle was stopped. The police say it is a federal investigation.   **Bottom line**   Immigration enforcement, the Supreme Court, U.S. foreign policy on Venezuela, and international shipping are all in the news. The debate over ICE accountability and Trump’s military plans has sparked protests and political pressure. Keep an eye on the Supreme Court for any tariff ruling, and watch for updates on the U.S.‑Venezuela situation."
