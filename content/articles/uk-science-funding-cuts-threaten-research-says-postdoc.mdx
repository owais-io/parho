title: "UK Science Funding Cuts Threaten Research, Says Postdoc"
summary: "A post‑doctoral researcher in Manchester says the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s funding cuts will hurt UK science. He argues that science needs steady money, not sudden increases or decreases, because training scientists takes years. He warns that cutting budgets could waste talent and suggests the UK should still fund basic, curiosity‑driven research, not just advanced tools. The STFC explains its cuts are needed to keep its projects affordable and is consulting scientists before final decisions."
