title: "Supreme Court May Let Dangerous ‘Conversion Therapy’ Return"
summary: "Conversion therapy claims gay people can be “cured,” but research shows it fails and harms kids. Most states forbid it, and mental‑health groups push for bans. The Supreme Court is debating whether to strike those bans, and a ruling to allow the practice would hurt LGBTQ+ youth. Survivors warn of depression, suicide, and new Trump‑era policies that target gay and trans people."
