title: "House Democrats Demand Release of Jack Smith’s Classified Documents Report"
summary: "House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are asking Judge Aileen Cannon to hand over the part of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s report that talks about classified documents. The request comes after the charges against Trump’s co‑defendants were dropped, so the court’s earlier order to keep the report hidden is no longer needed. Democrats want the report so they can better understand Smith’s investigation, especially before Smith’s upcoming deposition before the committee."
