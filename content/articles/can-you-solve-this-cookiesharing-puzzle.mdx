title: "Can You Solve This Cookie‑Sharing Puzzle?"
summary: "On World Logic Day, a brain‑teaser asks Andy, Bea and Celine to share ten cookies. They take turns in that order and can grab any amount they like. The catch? Nobody wants to finish with the most or the least cookies, and the rules say that avoiding extremes comes before trying to get as many as possible. They can’t talk or team up. The puzzle ends with the question: how many cookies does each get?"
