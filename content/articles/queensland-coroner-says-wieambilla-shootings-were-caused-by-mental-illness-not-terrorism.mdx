summary: "A Queensland coroner said the 2022 Wieambilla shootings were not terrorism but the result of the Train family's paranoid delusions. Gareth, Stacey and Nathaniel Train killed two police officers and a neighbour before being shot by police. The coroner highlighted that the officers’ handguns were under‑powered and urged stronger mental‑health checks for gun licence holders. Families want better protection, and the police minister will review the findings."
