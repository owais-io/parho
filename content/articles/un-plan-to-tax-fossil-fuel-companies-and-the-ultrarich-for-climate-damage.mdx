title: "UN Plan to Tax Fossil Fuel Companies and the Ultra‑Rich for Climate Damage"
summary: "The UN is negotiating a global tax treaty that would make fossil‑fuel producers and the wealthiest people pay for the damage they cause to the climate. Developing nations want tougher rules, but many proposals have been weakened or dropped, and the US has pulled out. If agreed, a 20% tax on the biggest oil companies and a small tax on the richest could raise trillions for climate‑resilient development."
