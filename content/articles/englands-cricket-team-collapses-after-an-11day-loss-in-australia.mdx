title: "England’s cricket team collapses after an 11‑day loss in Australia"
summary: "England's cricket team collapsed after an 11‑day tour in Australia, losing the Ashes 3‑0. The series highlighted poor prep: bowlers were unfit, coaching was chaotic, and the ‘Bazball’ batting style didn’t work against strong Australian bowlers. Leadership issues with McCullum and the ECB’s strategy were also blamed. Australia’s steady play and a decisive wicket by Scott Boland sealed the win. Fans were disappointed but the series showed that England needs a rebuild."
