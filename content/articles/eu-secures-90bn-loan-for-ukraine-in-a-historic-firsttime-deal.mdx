summary: "The EU had a hard time agreeing on a €90bn loan for Ukraine. A plan to use frozen Russian money was blocked by Belgium's leader, so they used a new Plan B that borrowed from the EU budget. The deal lets Ukraine get cash quickly, shows the EU can create new borrowing rules, and lets some countries avoid extra debt for its war‑relief needs."
