title: "UK’s use of sustainable aviation fuel likely misses 2025 goal"
summary: "UK airlines are falling short of the 2025 target for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Only 1.6% of jet fuel used was SAF, below the 2% mandate. The fuel comes mainly from recycled cooking oil from Asia. While SAF reduces overall emissions, production is slow and costs are high. The government hopes new rules and incentives will boost SAF use, but airlines doubt the targets are realistic."
