title: "US Jobs: 105,000 Lost in Oct, 64,000 Added in Nov"
summary: "The U.S. job market fell in October, losing 105,000 jobs, but rebounded in November with 64,000 new jobs, more than most experts predicted. Unemployment rose to 4.6%, a four‑year high. The data came late because a 43‑day government shutdown delayed collection. Fed Chair Powell said the numbers could be inflated and might be revised. Critics have questioned the accuracy of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ reports."
