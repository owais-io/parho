title: "New South Wales urges residents to claim their share of $300m in unclaimed money"
summary: "A lot of money – about $300 million – sits in New South Wales’ Treasury bank account, waiting for people who never got it. The money comes from overpaid wages, uncashed cheques, dividends, refunds and other amounts that the government can’t reach. Residents, especially in Sydney and nearby suburbs, can check online if they are owed money and claim it with a few ID documents. The state says it wants to return the money quickly."
