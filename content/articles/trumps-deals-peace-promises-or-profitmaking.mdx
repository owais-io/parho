title: "Trump’s deals: peace promises or profit‑making?"
summary: "Trump ran on a peace‑talk platform, saying he’d end wars in Gaza and Ukraine. In office he did win a brief Gaza ceasefire, but then the war went on, he bombed Yemen, and pushed for deals that benefited his own family. The article shows how Trump’s real estate and crypto projects, plus his son‑in‑law’s private‑equity ties, made millions while he was negotiating foreign policy. It argues his “deal‑making” is driven more by money than by a genuine desire for peace."
