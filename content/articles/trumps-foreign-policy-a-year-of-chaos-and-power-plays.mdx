title: "Trump’s Foreign Policy: A Year of Chaos and Power Plays"
summary: "Donald Trump’s second term has turned US foreign policy into a roller‑coaster of unpredictable moves. He’s tried to seize Greenland, invited Putin to a “peace board” while Russia keeps invading Ukraine, raised tariffs on French wine, and pushed NATO allies to spend more on defence. His style mixes personal ego with big‑picture claims, confusing allies and stirring global tension. These actions show a president who puts his personal ambitions above steady diplomacy."
