title: "Suspensions in England Limited to Serious Misbehaviour"
summary: "The UK government will only suspend students for the worst cases of violence or severe misconduct. For other bad behaviour, schools will use “internal exclusion” units where pupils stay on school grounds in supervised rooms. The move aims to keep suspensions effective while reducing time students spend out of class, but some teachers worry it could lessen the deterrent. A new schools white paper will outline the rules and also tackle how students with special needs fit into mainstream schools."
