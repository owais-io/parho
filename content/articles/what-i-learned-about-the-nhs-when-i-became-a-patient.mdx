title: "What I Learned About the NHS When I Became a Patient"
summary: "I watched a play about Aneurin Bevan, the man who started the NHS, and felt uneasy. Then I had to stay in the hospital for a week. While there I saw how nurses and doctors care for patients with patience and kindness. Everyone on the ward felt the same goal – to get better. The experience showed me that, even with its problems, the NHS is full of love and teamwork."
