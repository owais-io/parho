title: "Sasha DiGiulian Becomes First Woman to Climb El Capitan’s Toughest Route"
summary: "Sasha DiGiulian spent three years training for the hardest route on El Capitan in Yosemite, called Platinum. In November, she and partner Elliot Faber began the 39‑pitch climb, but a sudden storm trapped them on the wall for almost three weeks. They slept in a tiny hanging shelter while rain, snow and wind battered them. After the storm passed, Sasha pushed on, finished the route alone and became the first woman to free‑climb Platinum."
