title: "British Falcons Are Being Smuggled to the Middle East for a Luxury Trade"
summary: "A new investigation shows that the high‑end falcon market in the UAE is buying British birds that are illegally taken from wild nests. Police and wildlife groups say hundreds of chicks disappear each year, and some end up in Middle‑East deserts with fake passports. Breeders in Britain grow and sell these birds, but many of the birds are actually wild‑caught, despite laws that forbid it. The trade threatens the country’s once‑endangered falcons and fuels a shadow industry."
