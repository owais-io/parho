title: "**What happened?**"
summary: "In the Swiss ski town of Crans‑Montana, a bar called *Le Constellation* was full of people celebrating New Year’s Eve. Around 1:30 a.m., a fire started. It spread fast, burned the wooden ceiling, and caused the ceiling to collapse. The blaze turned the party into a tragedy. **Results of the fire**   About 40 people died and 115 were hurt. Many injuries were serious, with deep burns. The fire was not a planned attack; investigators say no one has proven it was caused by a bomb or a deliberate act. **Why it was so hard to know the exact numbers**   The bodies were badly burned. Scientists have to use dental records and DNA to identify who died. That can take days or even weeks. Families are waiting for news because the authorities can’t give a final death toll until they are sure of the identities. **How people are being helped**   The injured were taken to hospitals in Sion, Lausanne, Geneva, and Zurich. Some were sent to hospitals in France and Italy, and 14 Poles were given special treatment in Polish hospitals, at Switzerland’s request. The Swiss government is helping all victims, and many other countries have offered support. **What is happening now**   Police and forensic teams are working hard to identify the victims. A funeral centre in Sion is receiving bodies. The local community has laid flowers and lit candles to honor those who died. Swiss officials say the investigation will keep going until they can give families the full information."
