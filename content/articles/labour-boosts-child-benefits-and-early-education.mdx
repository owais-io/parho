title: "Labour Boosts Child Benefits and Early Education"
summary: "A new report shows many toddlers lack language skills and struggle with screen‑time, linking the problems to poverty and a post‑pandemic shift in family life. Labour has lifted the two‑child cap on child benefits and set up “Best Start” hubs that bring speech‑language support and a national year of reading into nurseries. By redirecting money from richer families to poorer ones, the party is tackling child poverty and giving parents and children the help they need."
