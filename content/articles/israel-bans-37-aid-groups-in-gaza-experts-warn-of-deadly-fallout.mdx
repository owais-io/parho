title: "Israel bans 37 aid groups in Gaza, experts warn of deadly fallout"
summary: "Israel has told 37 aid organisations operating in Gaza to stop working or face a ban in 60 days. The new rule forces NGOs to give detailed staff lists, a measure Israel says will stop Hamas from hijacking aid. Humanitarian groups argue they already vet staff and that the ban would cripple relief, putting hundreds of thousands of civilians at risk. The UN and EU have condemned the ban, warning of a catastrophic collapse of services."
