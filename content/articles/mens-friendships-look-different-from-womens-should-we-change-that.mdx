title: "Men’s friendships look different from women’s – should we change that?"
summary: "Men often make friends by doing activities together and talking little, while women usually chat about feelings. The piece shows old men who work on steam trains have quiet bonds that still show care. Even without words, they help each other when someone gets sick or misses a meeting. It argues that different friendship styles are okay and that we shouldn’t try to force men to act like women. Talking openly isn’t the only way to feel supported."
