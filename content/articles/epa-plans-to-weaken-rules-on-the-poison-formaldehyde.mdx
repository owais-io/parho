title: "EPA Plans to Weaken Rules on the Poison Formaldehyde"
summary: "The Trump‑era EPA wants to raise the amount of formaldehyde people can safely breathe. That would let more of the cancer‑causing gas stay in everyday things like furniture, clothing, cleaners and even paint. The move is led by former chemical‑industry bosses now in the agency. If approved, the rules that limit formaldehyde use would be weaker, putting people at higher risk of cancer, breathing problems and other health harms."
