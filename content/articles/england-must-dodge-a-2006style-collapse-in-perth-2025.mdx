title: "England Must Dodge a 2006‑Style Collapse in Perth 2025"
summary: "England’s recent loss in Perth shows they could repeat the 2006 Adelaide collapse. A key moment was Broad’s silent sigh after a poor over by Joe Root, showing they were taking very few wickets. With top bowlers injured and the middle order faltering, England’s morale feels weak. The team must learn from past mistakes, stay focused, and let captain Ben Stokes lead them through the tough pink‑ball test games."
