title: "Swift Courts Face Huge Challenges"
summary: "England is considering a new “swift court” that would let a judge and magistrates handle cases without a jury. But the country already has a severe shortage of magistrates – only 2,008 new ones have been recruited since 2022, and the acceptance rate is just 22%. Extending magistrates’ sentencing powers would double their workload, and critics fear it would erode the right to a jury. The proposal also ignores the existing backlog and may divert resources away from faster justice for victims."
