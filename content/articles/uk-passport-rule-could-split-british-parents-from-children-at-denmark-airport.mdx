title: "UK passport rule could split British parents from children at Denmark airport"
summary: "New UK rules say anyone with two nationalities must show a British passport or a special certificate to fly home. James Scrivens, a Brit, and his Danish wife were warned only while traveling in Norway and Denmark. Their two children, born in the UK but holding only Danish passports, might not be allowed to board a plane, forcing the family to split. The government says the policy is clear, but critics call for better communication and a grace period."
