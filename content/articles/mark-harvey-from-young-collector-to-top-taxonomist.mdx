title: "Mark Harvey: From Young Collector to Top Taxonomist"
summary: "Mark Harvey, an Australian scientist, began collecting tiny spiders and pseudoscorpions at age 18. Since then, he has named over 1,000 new species, including spiders, scorpions, and velvet worms. He worked at the Western Australian Museum and studied animals worldwide. His work in taxonomy helps protect species, and though he recently retired, he still has many more discoveries to make while warning about habitat loss."
