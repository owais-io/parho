title: "UK plans to cut jury trials face backlash, may be toned down"
summary: "UK Justice Secretary David Lammy wants to cut jury trials by moving many cases to judge‑only “swift courts” to clear a backlog of 80,000 cases. The proposal would stop juries for cases punishable by up to three years. MPs, peers and lawyers have opposed the plan, saying it removes lay people from the court. The government may soften the rules, bringing back two magistrates to sit with judges, to win support in the Lords."
