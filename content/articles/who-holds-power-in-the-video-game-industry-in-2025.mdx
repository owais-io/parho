title: "Who Holds Power in the Video Game Industry in 2025?"
summary: "Video games are almost $200 bn, yet a few firms control most of the industry. In 2025, indie hits like *Hollow Knight: Silksong* proved small teams can create games without huge budgets. Switch 2 was welcomed, but job losses and AI tools caused concern. Workers unionised, and mega‑deals such as Microsoft buying Activision and Saudi investors buying EA and Niantic concentrated money even more. Politicians and right‑wing groups now use game imagery to push agendas, proving games matter beyond entertainment."
