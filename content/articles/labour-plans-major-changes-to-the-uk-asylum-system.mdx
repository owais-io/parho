title: "Labour plans major changes to the UK asylum system"
summary: "Labour’s home secretary says the UK asylum system is a mess and wants changes. Refugees could lose permanent status and would need to reapply every 2½ years, and if their home country becomes safe they might be sent back. The protection period would shrink to 30 months, and housing and money help would be cut. The government will also use AI to check ages and create new legal ways to come to the UK, while tightening court rules and rights."
