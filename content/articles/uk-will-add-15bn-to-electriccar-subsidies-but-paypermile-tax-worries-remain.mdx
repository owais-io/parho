title: "UK will add £1.5bn to electric‑car subsidies, but pay‑per‑mile tax worries remain"
summary: "Rachel Reeves will raise the electric‑car grant by £1.3 bn and add £200 m for more charging points, keeping the £400 m scheme in place until 2030. The extra money is meant to make new EVs cheaper and fix range‑anxiety. But the chancellor is also expected to propose a pay‑per‑mile tax that could add about £276 a year to an owner’s bill. Experts say the tax could hurt the growing EV market."
