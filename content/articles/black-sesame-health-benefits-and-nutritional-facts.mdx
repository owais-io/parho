title: "Black Sesame: Health Benefits and Nutritional Facts"
summary: "Black sesame is becoming a hit in the US, but what does it actually give you? The seeds are packed with minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium that help bones, heart, and blood pressure. A tablespoon a day can modestly improve blood sugar and cholesterol, though results are small. It’s low in carbs, high in healthy fats, and adds antioxidants. Watch your calories, allergy risk, and talk to a doctor if you’re on blood‑pressure meds."
