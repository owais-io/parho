title: "Cortina 2026: Olympics Promise Green, Deliver Destruction"
summary: "The 2026 Winter Olympics in Cortina were marketed as a green event, but the reality is far from it. Organisers cut down the Bosco di Ronco forest, built new tracks and resorts, and pumped huge amounts of water from drought‑stricken rivers to make artificial snow. Most construction projects were ignored by environmental reviews, and the WWF pulled out after seeing the damage. Local businesses see little benefit, while the planet pays the price."
