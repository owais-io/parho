title: "UK Wants to Re‑join EU Defence Fund"
summary: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he wants the UK to join the EU’s big defence fund again. Last month talks fell apart because the EU set a high price to enter the fund, and France said the UK must help fund a separate programme. The UK says it would only pay a few hundred million. Talks are set to resume next week, with the UK hoping to get a seat in the fund for future rounds."
