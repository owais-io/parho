title: "Trump’s Return Drags the US Into Isolation"
summary: "New data from Focaldata shows that after Trump took office, the US lost most of its traditional allies in UN votes. Only seven countries now consistently back the US, while China’s bloc stays at 73. Big partners like Canada, UK, Germany, Japan, and South Korea have begun voting with China. Trump’s votes on Ukraine and Gaza, and opposition to many resolutions, have pushed the US into isolation. The trend could continue as fast‑growing economies lean toward China."
