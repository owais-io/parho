title: "Treasurer Jim Chalmers Faces Rising Deficit in Mid‑Year Budget"
summary: "Jim Chalmers, the treasurer, has released the government’s mid‑year budget outlook. The deficit is set to jump to about $37 billion, almost quadrupling the previous year, though it’s a little better than earlier forecasts. He’ll keep the temporary energy‑rebate cut and will add money for disaster aid, pensions and defence, while trimming spending on consultants and hiring. The budget also pushes a battery‑storage scheme, but no long‑term plan to stop the rising debt."
