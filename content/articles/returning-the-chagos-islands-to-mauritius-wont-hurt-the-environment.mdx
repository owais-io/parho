title: "Returning the Chagos Islands to Mauritius Won’t Hurt the Environment"
summary: "The Chagos Islands have been a subject of debate, with some saying that giving them back to Mauritius would damage the environment. In fact, the islands’ land and sea have already recovered after years of neglect, and Mauritius plans only light, traditional fishing. The return is legal and right for the people who were forced away, and it won’t cause major ecological harm."
