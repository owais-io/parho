title: "Court backlog will take 10 years to clear, says Ministry of Justice"
summary: "The UK Ministry of Justice says it will take about ten years to bring the criminal court backlog back to pre‑COVID levels, even with big changes. Today more than 80,000 cases sit in crown courts, and that could rise to 100,000 by 2028. The plan cuts jury trials, adds judge‑only hearings, and gives courts extra sitting days, plus £2.8 bn in new funding. Critics worry about losing the right to a jury, while victims still wait months for justice."
