title: "Replace cod and prawns with greener seafood options"
summary: "Britain’s seafood menu is stuck on a handful of fish. Chefs say you can swap cod, haddock, salmon, tuna and prawns for greener options like mussels, hake, monkfish, sardines and scallops. Each is more sustainable, from rope‑growing mussels to net‑caught hake that avoids dolphins, to small‑net sardines. They’re tasty too – steam mussels with wine, bake hake, grill scallops, or toss sardines on toast."
