title: "Truck and Bus Pollution Cost Australians $6.2 Billion a Year in Health Damage"
summary: "A University of Melbourne study says heavy diesel trucks and buses – just 4 % of the vehicle fleet – create a quarter of Australia’s road pollution and cost the country $6.2 billion each year in health damage. The bill covers premature deaths, hospital stays, early‑onset asthma and lung cancer, especially hurting children, the elderly and low‑income families living near major routes. Researchers urge older trucks to be removed, freight shifted to rail, and a move to electric vehicles."
