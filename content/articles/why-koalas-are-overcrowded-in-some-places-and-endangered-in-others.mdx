title: "Why Koalas Are Overcrowded in Some Places and Endangered in Others"
summary: "On French Island and in South Australia’s Mount Lofty Ranges, koalas are too many. They eat all the eucalyptus, leaving trees bare and some animals starving. These over‑populations started when koalas were moved to islands and new forests. In the north‑east, koalas are endangered because of habitat loss, disease and cars. Scientists say we need to move or sterilise some koalas and restore mixed forests to keep the species safe."
