title: "Tesla Forecasts 2025 Sales Will Be Lower Than CEO’s Targets"
summary: "Tesla published analyst forecasts that predict 2025 deliveries will fall 16% from 2024, with only 1.64 million cars instead of the 1.79 million expected. Future targets are also lower, reaching 3 million cars only by 2029, far behind CEO Elon Musk’s goal of 4 million by 2027. Investors react to these numbers, and Musk’s compensation ties to 20 million car deliveries. Tesla’s valuation still high but sales outlook is cautious."
