title: "How State Violence Against Black Americans Signals the Rise of Fascism"
summary: "Jason Stanley argues that the U.S. has long used state violence against Black people—like police raids in Minneapolis—as a rehearsal for fascism. He points to history, legal racism, and the growth of white‑supremacist institutions such as ICE and DHS. He says that these “exceptions” to equal rights are a launchpad for an autocratic future that would hurt all groups, from immigrants to LGBTQ+ people. The article calls for dismantling those institutions."
