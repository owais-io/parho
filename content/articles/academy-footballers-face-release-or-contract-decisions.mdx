title: "Academy footballers face release or contract decisions"
summary: "Academy footballers 15‑16 face a tight deadline: clubs must decide if they keep them before 31 December. Around half of players leave the academy by 16, and clubs only fund eight scholarships a year. With stricter rules on signing non‑British talent, scouts race to grab those who aren’t top‑grade. New contracts are usually long, but can lock players into low wages. Young players need senior game time, and choosing an agent is a big decision."
