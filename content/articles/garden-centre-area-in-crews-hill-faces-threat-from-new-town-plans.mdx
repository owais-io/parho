title: "Garden centre area in Crews Hill faces threat from new town plans"
summary: "Crews Hill, a green belt spot near London, has a stretch of family‑run garden centres called the “golden mile.” The government is considering turning it into a new town with 21,000 homes, half of which would be affordable. Local shop owners worry the plan could force them to move or close. Residents and council members argue the area should keep its businesses and instead use other sites for housing. The decision is pending this spring."
