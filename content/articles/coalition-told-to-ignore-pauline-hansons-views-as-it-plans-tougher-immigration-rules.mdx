title: "Coalition Told to Ignore Pauline Hanson’s Views as It Plans Tougher Immigration Rules"
summary: "Australia’s opposition is drafting a new immigration plan that could cut rights for asylum seekers, speeding up deportations. Experts say the cuts would slow the system, fuel more appeals, and leave people stuck in limbo. The plan would also lower overseas migration, tighten rules on foreign students at universities, and limit property purchases by foreigners. MPs worry the move might push back migrant communities and harm the country’s reputation."
