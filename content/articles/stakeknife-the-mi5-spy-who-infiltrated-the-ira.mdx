title: "Stakeknife: The MI5 Spy Who Infiltrated the IRA"
summary: "Stakeknife was the nickname for Freddie Scappaticci, a former IRA member who fed information to MI5. He began spying in the 1970s, running a unit that tortured and killed suspected informers. Over the years, he slipped in and out of IRA ranks, becoming a key source for British security forces. In 2024 an investigation called Operation Kenova found that Stakeknife probably caused more deaths than he prevented. The final report urges the UK to admit the harm and apologise."
