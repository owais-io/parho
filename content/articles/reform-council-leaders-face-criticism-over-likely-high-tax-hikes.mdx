title: "Reform council leaders face criticism over likely high tax hikes"
summary: "Reform council leaders have promised to cut costs but may have to raise taxes by up to 4.99% in several counties. In Warwickshire, experts say any rise below 4.99% would threaten the council's finances, so the party faces criticism for making “rash promises” during the campaign. Other Reform‑led councils in Kent, Leicestershire and North Northamptonshire are also under scrutiny. The parties will decide on rates once the government releases funding."
