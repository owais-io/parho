title: "Quoting religious texts could shield people from Australia’s new hate‑speech laws"
summary: "Australia plans new hate‑speech laws that make it illegal to spread hate or claim superiority because of race or ethnicity. The draft says people can defend themselves if they are only quoting a religious text for teaching or discussion. The bill also adds stricter penalties, a new racial vilification offence, a list of hate groups and a big gun‑buyback program. Some politicians worry the package mixes unrelated issues, but the prime minister wants it through fast."
