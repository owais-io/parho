title: "U.S. Politicians Turn Ukrainian Refugee’s Murder into Political Murals"
summary: "A 23‑year‑old Ukrainian refugee, Iryna Zarutska, was stabbed in North Carolina last year. Her death has been turned into a political billboard: conservatives, including Trump, Musk, and others, have funded huge murals of her face across the country. They use her story to attack crime and media, but many locals and artists say the project is top‑down, politicised, and missing the victim’s humanity."
