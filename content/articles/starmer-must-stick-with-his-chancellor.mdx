title: "Starmer Must Stick With His Chancellor"
summary: "Starmer has been under pressure from opposition leader Kemi Badenoch to fire his chancellor, but the move could backfire. After a string of resignations, including the OBR chief, Labour is already shaky. Starmer’s latest budget kept the income‑tax manifesto promise and focused on cutting energy bills and lifting the two‑child cap. He defended the chancellor against market‑misleading claims and said he’d stay with her to protect his own political survival."
