title: "UK Graduates Face Heaviest Student Loan Burden Yet"
summary: "UK student loans have become a generational problem. New rules put graduates on a plan with 9% interest and a frozen repayment threshold, meaning many owe more than they can pay. Politicians, including the Green Party, are calling for debt forgiveness or better reforms. The crisis hurts people who already struggle to buy a home or start a family, and could push the UK into higher taxes for everyone."
