title: "Glitter at Rio Carnival Hurts Beaches: Time to Ban It"
summary: "Rio’s huge carnival parties have a sparkling problem: glitter, made of tiny plastic pieces, floods the beach and ends up in the ocean. A study found micro‑plastic levels spiked during the festival, harming marine life and potentially human health. While Europe has banned plastic glitter, Brazil’s bill to stop its sale has stalled. Biodegradable glitter is pricier, so most revelers keep using the cheap, harmful version."
