title: "Scientists discover where thin high clouds come from"
summary: "New study shows that some of the sky's thin, high‑altitude cirrus clouds actually start because of storms on the other side of the world. By using a new computer method on satellite images, scientists found that big storm systems send atmospheric waves that travel across the equator, changing the upper‑air temperature and sparking cloud formation. These clouds let light in but trap heat, so changes in storm patterns could affect how much they warm the planet."
