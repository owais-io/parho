title: "England’s poorest communities will get worse by next election, report says"
summary: "A new report for the Prime Minister’s office says crime and unemployment in England’s 613 most deprived neighbourhoods will rise by 2030, even with current investment. The analysis shows that the government’s £20m‑per‑area Pride in Place plan is too small to reverse long‑term decline. MPs warn that without extra funding—up to £2.5bn a year—poverty and antisocial behaviour will worsen, risking political backlash."
