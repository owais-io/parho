title: "Labour stalls economic action while UK economy slows"
summary: "Labour’s recent policy moves have been slow, even as the UK economy is shrinking and could slide into a mild recession. New business‑rate rules are set to raise costs for pubs, especially small independent ones, and a fresh inheritance‑tax plan would hit farmers and family‑owned firms, making it harder to keep land in the family. The party’s focus on election timing keeps decisions stalled, leaving many businesses hurt by poorly‑planned taxes."
