title: "UK regulators let news sites stop Google AI summaries"
summary: "The UK competition watchdog, the CMA, is giving newspapers and web publishers the right to say no to Google’s AI Overviews, the short summaries that appear at the top of search results. Those summaries keep readers from clicking on the original articles, hurting publishers’ traffic and revenue. The CMA wants Google to treat sites fairly and let them opt out of AI use while staying in normal search. The regulator is still waiting a year before deciding on further actions."
