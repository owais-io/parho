title: "Reforming the House of Lords: Experts, Not Elections"
summary: "Jenny Jones says the House of Lords should become an expert chamber, not an elected one. She proposes members be chosen by the public but voted in by the Commons, serve five‑year terms, and focus on scrutinising laws and the executive. She warns against an elected second house that could create two democratic mandates. Letters echo her call for change, but some want to keep hereditary or episcopal peers or abolish the Lords entirely after scandals like Peter Mandelson’s."
