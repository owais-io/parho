title: "Civil groups oppose new police powers that could limit protests"
summary: "More than 40 civil‑society groups, from unions to environmental and human‑rights organisations, say the UK’s new policing bill would let authorities block protests if a city has seen earlier demonstrations. They call it a “draconian” clamp‑down that could stop rallies on unrelated issues, like an anti‑racist march, because of a previous farmers’ protest. The government says the powers are meant to keep communities safe after Gaza‑related marches. The groups urge scrapping the amendment and defending the right to protest."
