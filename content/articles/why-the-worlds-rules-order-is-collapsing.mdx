title: "Why the World’s Rules Order Is Collapsing"
summary: "The letter says the post‑Cold‑War rules‑based system is breaking down because powerful countries, including the US, China, Russia, Israel and others, keep breaking rules. It urges a fresh start for global institutions like the UN and NATO, and calls for major reforms—especially in the UN Security Council—to curb elite and corporate influence. The author points out the US’s double‑standard support for Israel and criticises its failure to uphold human rights and the rule of law."
