title: "Hospital corridor care is killing patients and scaring staff"
summary: "NHS staff say keeping patients in corridors is like torture, leading to deaths and nightmares. In some hospitals, dining rooms and kitchens are turned into makeshift wards because there are not enough beds. Nurses reported patients dying in these unsafe spaces, and many staff are worried about the safety of the practice. Health officials promised to stop corridor care by 2029, but hospitals still face overcrowding and delays."
