title: "A Buzzard Encounter That Felt Strange"
summary: "While cycling north of Hargatewall, I spotted a buzzard perched on a wall. Unlike the usually swift red kite, the buzzard was slow and brown, oddly calm even when a tractor rolled past. I wondered why it stayed – was it hungry, sick, or tired of the cold wind? The bird’s intense stare made the moment feel oddly tense, leaving me with questions about its health and purpose."
