title: "Should I end a friendship with a self‑centered friend?"
summary: "After 20 years, I’m dealing with a friend who talks only about herself. Even when I share my own stories or give advice, she shifts the topic back to her interests. I feel unheard and my confidence suffers. A therapist suggested I explain what happens, how it makes me feel, and ask how we can change the friendship. He recommends a calm, private face‑to‑face chat rather than a quick breakup."
