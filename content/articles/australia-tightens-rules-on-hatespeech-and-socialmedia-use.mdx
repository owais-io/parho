title: "**Australia Tightens Rules on Hate‑Speech and Social‑Media Use**"
summary: "*By a news reporter* Australia is taking new steps to stop hate‑speech and protect young people from too‑much screen time. --- ### 1. Hate‑speech law gets a big push * The government will start a new law that says people can’t spread hateful messages about protected groups (like Jews, Muslims, or transgender people). * The law is part of a package that also deals with gun‑reform and migration changes. * Critics say the law will be rushed.     * It will be discussed in parliament in a short time, which may not give experts enough chance to share their views. * The opposition says a *royal commission* should look into hate‑speech first, so the law can be fair. ### 2. Social‑media ban for under‑16s * Australia is studying a rule that would stop children younger than 16 from using popular apps (TikTok, Instagram, etc.). * The idea came after worries about how much time kids spend on their phones. * The UK may copy Australia’s approach.     * The UK’s Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, said he is thinking of a similar plan for Britain.   * He said there are ways to enforce it that Britain could try. ### 3. Bushfires hit Victoria * Eleven bushfires are still burning in Victoria, though most are “watch” warnings. * The state’s fire chief warns that people should stay away from still‑dangerous areas. * The premier, Jacinta Allan, visited fire‑affected towns but faced angry crowds.     * Residents were upset because they felt the government was not ready for the fires.   * They asked her to explain the lack of fire‑preparedness and why some towns were cut off from the internet. ### 4. Adelaide writers’ week drama * The former festival director, Louise Adler, called the recent chaos a “masterclass in poor governance.” * The festival was pulled after 180 writers quit because they were unhappy with political pressure. * Adler says the festival will likely return in 2027, “coming from the ashes.” --- **Bottom line** Australia is trying to curb hate‑speech and protect young people from dangerous online content, while also dealing with natural disasters and cultural events. The speed of the law‑making and the impact on freedom of speech are key points of debate."
