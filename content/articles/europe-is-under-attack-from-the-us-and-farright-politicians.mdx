title: "Europe is under attack from the U.S. and far‑right politicians"
summary: "Europe’s security and democracy face a double attack: the U.S. government and Silicon Valley tech firms are pushing far‑right parties across Europe. Washington’s new strategy focuses on force, nationalism and deregulating tech, while funding groups that support candidates in Austria, Hungary, Italy and Poland. Because European militaries still rely on U.S. aid, leaders are pressured to stay quiet. To survive, Europe must strengthen ties with other liberal democracies like Canada, Australia and South Korea."
