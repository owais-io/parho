title: "UK posts record £30.4bn budget surplus in January"
summary: "UK government made a record £30.4bn surplus in January, double last year’s amount, thanks to higher tax receipts and lower borrowing costs. The boost comes as capital gains and self‑assessed taxes rose, while spending stayed flat. It cuts the year‑to‑date deficit to £112bn, below forecasts, and may help the chancellor show stronger finances in her March statement. However, the overall budget still needs more borrowing."
