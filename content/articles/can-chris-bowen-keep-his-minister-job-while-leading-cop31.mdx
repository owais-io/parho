title: "Can Chris Bowen Keep His Minister Job While Leading COP31?"
summary: "Australia’s climate minister, Chris Bowen, has been named vice‑president and president of negotiations for the upcoming COP31 summit in Turkey. Some members of Parliament said he should stay focused on domestic energy bills, but climate experts argue it’s common for ministers to lead global talks. They say Bowen can juggle both jobs, and the role is smaller than past COP leaders. The move shows Australia is serious about climate action."
