title: "Boris Johnson Took Four Days Off While NHS Warned of Covid Overload"
summary: "During February 2020, when the NHS warned that Covid could flood the system, Boris Johnson spent four days off on a half‑term break at Chevening in Kent.

A Covid inquiry later said the UK’s response was too slow and that Johnson missed key briefings, showing he ignored early warnings."
