title: "What Americans Miss by Not Using Truth Social"
summary: "Donald Trump mainly talks to the public on Truth Social, a platform that only about 3 % of Americans use. Because so few people see his posts, many miss his wild tweets, racist comments, and confusion over fake videos. Trump has posted wildly, even calling Somali Americans “inbred savages,” and mixed up facts about a university shooting. While some posts spill into mainstream media, most people stay in the dark, raising questions about his fitness for office as elections loom."
