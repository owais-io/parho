title: "Sydney Bus Bans Bikinis to Keep Seats Clean"
summary: "The Northern Beaches council in Sydney has stopped bikini‑clad and shirtless passengers from riding its free Hop, Skip and Jump bus after complaints. Council says wet or sandy swimwear can dirty the bus, so drivers can refuse riders wearing it. The rule sparked mixed reactions online – some support the hygiene argument, others see it as over‑policing and a gender double standard. Experts note the ban reflects longstanding views on women’s bodies."
