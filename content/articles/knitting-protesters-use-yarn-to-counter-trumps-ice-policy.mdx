title: "Knitting Protesters Use Yarn to Counter Trump’s ICE Policy"
summary: "Tracy Wright started a group of Portland knitters who met outside the ICE building to show that life keeps going. They called themselves Knitters Against Fascism and kept knitting each week. The movement grew when designer Michele Bernstein made a frog‑hat pattern that people sold to raise money for food banks. The story is part of a long tradition of “craftivism,” where people use yarn, embroidery, and other crafts to protest, raise funds, and build community."
