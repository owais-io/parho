title: "Global warming made Australia’s worst heatwave 5 times more likely"
summary: "Scientists say the January heatwave that scorched Australia was five times more likely because of human‑made climate change. The storm, the worst since the 2019‑20 black summer, saw temperatures over 40 °C in cities like Melbourne and Sydney and sparked huge bushfires in Victoria. The study found greenhouse gases pushed the heat 1.6 °C higher, while a mild La Niña actually lowered temps a little. Experts warn similar events could become common in the next decades."
