title: "Israel Recognises Somaliland as an Independent Country"
summary: "Israel is the first nation to officially recognise Somaliland, a region that declared independence from Somalia in 1991 but has not been recognised by other UN members. The new agreement will set up embassies and appoint ambassadors. Somaliland sits in north‑western Somalia, bordering Djibouti and Ethiopia. The move has drawn criticism from Somalia, the African Union, Egypt, and Turkey, who say it undermines Somali unity. Israel says the decision supports peace‑building and could help monitor conflicts in Yemen."
