summary: "The Jockey Club, a powerful racing body, has an option for a developer to buy and turn the historic Kempton track into up to 3,000 homes. New chief executive Jim Mullen said there are no concrete plans yet, but the developer could act when the new planning law passes, which would limit local councils' power to stop the build. Fans, trainers, and local residents have protested, and the club’s old‑style governance raises concerns about its decision‑making."
