title: "2026 Expected to be Over 1.4 °C Warmer Than Pre‑Industrial Times"
summary: "Scientists at the UK Met Office say the planet will be more than 1.4 °C warmer than the pre‑industrial period by 2026. That makes 2026 one of the four hottest years since 1850, after 2024’s record 1.55 °C rise and with 2025 likely the second‑or‑third hottest year. The warming comes from the build‑up of carbon in the air from burning fossil fuels and loss of natural “carbon sinks.” Global leaders want to keep warming below 1.5 °C, but 2024 already exceeded it."
