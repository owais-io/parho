title: "High Court Declares NT Rent Increase Policy for Remote Indigenous Communities Unlawful"
summary: "The High Court found that a policy in the Northern Territory that raised rents for remote Aboriginal housing was unlawful. The policy, called the Remote Rental Framework, had tripled or even doubled rent for many tenants. The court said the government failed to give tenants notice or a chance to speak. The decision means the rent changes are invalid, and the government must work with communities to set a fair rent system again."
