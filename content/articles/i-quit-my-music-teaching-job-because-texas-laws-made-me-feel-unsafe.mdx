title: "I Quit My Music Teaching Job Because Texas Laws Made Me Feel Unsafe"
summary: "I was a trans man teaching music in Texas. A new bathroom rule forced schools to pay huge fines if someone reported a staff member who used the wrong restroom. The fear of being exposed and the health problems from holding it made me quit. I moved to a tech support job that covers my medical care and found a supportive community. Leaving felt like a loss, but it gave me safety."
