title: "U.S. Volunteers Say Trump’s Peace Plan Is a Betrayal"
summary: "Many Americans who have helped train and support Ukraine are furious about Trump’s new peace proposal. They say it simply copies Russia’s demands—giving up Ukrainian territory, forbidding NATO membership, and shrinking the army. Veterans, soldiers, and even some GOP politicians call the plan a “betrayal” and “back‑stabbing.” The plan’s release has sparked a sharp backlash, with critics arguing it would force Ukraine to surrender and undermine its fight for freedom."
