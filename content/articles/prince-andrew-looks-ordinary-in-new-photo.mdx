title: "Prince Andrew Looks Ordinary in New Photo"
summary: "The letter argues that Phil Noble’s recent photo of Prince Andrew shows him as an ordinary person, not a royal icon. It compares the image to Joan Miró’s 1974 sculpture that stripped a king to everyday materials, exposing the myth that royalty is special. The piece suggests the monarchy’s glamour has collapsed, leaving a raw, human figure behind the title. Readers are encouraged to see royalty as just people, not divine beings."
