title: "Michael Jordan Sues NASCAR Over Team Rules"
summary: "Michael Jordan, who co‑owns the 23XI Racing team, is suing NASCAR because the sport’s charter system gives NASCAR too much control over where teams race, how much money they earn, and the rules they must follow. Teams say the charters are like golden tickets but can be revoked or changed, making it hard to plan and invest. NASCAR says it’s normal business and the lawsuit could change how the sport is run."
