title: "Schools Asked to Try Four‑Day Weeks to Help Teachers"
summary: "A group called the 4 Day Week Foundation wants the UK government to let schools test four‑day teaching weeks. They say shorter weeks could reduce teacher burnout, help keep and hire more teachers, and still keep kids learning well. The government says schools can try different schedules, but it has not formally approved a four‑day week. Some schools are already experimenting, and teachers want more time to plan and mark work."
