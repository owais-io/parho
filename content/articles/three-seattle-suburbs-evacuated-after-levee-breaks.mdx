title: "Three Seattle Suburbs Evacuated After Levee Breaks"
summary: "Three suburbs east of the Green River – Kent, Auburn and Tukwila – had to leave their homes early Monday because a levee on the Desimone River gave way after a week of record rain. About 47,000 people got a flash‑flood warning, and the county is putting sandbags in the hole while the National Guard arrives for help. The levee had been damaged in 2020 and big repairs won’t finish until 2031, so workers are keeping it stable for now."
