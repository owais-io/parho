title: "Spider Monkeys Share Food Tips by Switching Groups"
summary: "Scientists watched spider monkeys in Mexico for seven years and found that they split into small groups that change every day. By swapping partners, each monkey learns where fruit trees are and when they ripen. When they later regroup, they combine their clues, so the whole troop knows the best food spots. The study shows the monkeys use teamwork to eat better."
