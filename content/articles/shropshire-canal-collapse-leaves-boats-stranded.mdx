title: "Shropshire Canal Collapse Leaves Boats Stranded"
summary: "In early Monday, a 200‑year‑old artificial embankment on the Llangollen canal gave way, opening a hole that dropped two narrowboats inside and trapped others on either side. Emergency crews worked for 24 hours to seal the break and refloat the stranded boats. The cause is still unknown, though high water and salty earth may have weakened the structure. Repairs could take 6‑9 months and cost several million pounds, while boat owners are being helped for the holiday."
