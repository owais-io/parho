title: "Virginia Voters to Decide If the State Constitution Will Protect Abortion Rights"
summary: "Virginia lawmakers let voters decide on a new state‑constitution amendment that would guarantee abortion rights. Both the Senate and the House approved the measure, and Democrats control the legislature. If voters approve it in November, Virginia will say everyone has a right to reproductive freedom, though rules could still limit late‑term abortions. The change follows the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision that ended Roe v. Wade, and similar votes are happening in other states."
