title: "Texas teachers union sues state over investigations of teachers’ social‑media posts"
summary: "A Texas teachers union sued the state, saying investigations into teachers’ social‑media posts after the death of activist Charlie Kirk violate free‑speech rights. School officials were told to report any “reprehensible” comments about Kirk, leading to disciplinary actions for several teachers. The agency has received hundreds of complaints; most are dismissed, but many teachers still face investigations. The union wants the court to stop the probes. This lawsuit also requests new guidance so districts don’t have to report teachers’ personal remarks."
