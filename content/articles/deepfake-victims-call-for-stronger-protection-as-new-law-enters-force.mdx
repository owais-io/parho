title: "Deepfake Victims Call for Stronger Protection as New Law Enters Force"
summary: "A new UK law that makes it a crime to create non‑consensual deepfake porn is now in force. Victims, led by the campaign group Stop Image‑Based Abuse, have signed a petition of more than 73,000 people asking the government to add civil remedies, like takedown orders, and better support services. The law was delayed, and many say it still leaves gaps, especially for sex workers."
