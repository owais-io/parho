title: "Ballymena riots: six months later, fear and silence remain"
summary: "After last summer’s riot in Ballymena, where crowds attacked immigrant homes, the town still feels uneasy. Many houses were burned and people keep curtains drawn. While most rioters were angry at Roma families, other foreigners were hurt too. The incident led to more hate crimes across Northern Ireland. Local councils have stayed quiet, and most Roma left the area, with a few now back but hiding. Police have charged over 90 people, but tensions remain."
