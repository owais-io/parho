title: "NYC Nurses to Strike Over Pay, Staffing, and Safety"
summary: "About 16,000 nurses in New York City plan a strike on Monday, demanding better pay, safer staffing ratios, full health benefits and improved workplace safety. The union says hospitals want to cut costs, even as CEO pay is far higher and hospitals have billions in cash. They’re also hiring travel nurses to replace striking staff. Hospitals argue they’re negotiating in good faith and claim the strike could hurt patients. The dispute centers on whether money should be spent on staff or patient care."
