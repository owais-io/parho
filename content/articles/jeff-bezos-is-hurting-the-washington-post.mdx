title: "Jeff Bezos Is Hurting the Washington Post"
summary: "Jeff Bezos’s control of the Washington Post is hurting the paper. After buying it in 2013, he has cut staff, pushed a right‑leaning editorial line, and changed the paper’s tone. These moves have driven away readers and top writers, and the Post now loses money each year. The writer argues Bezos could simply fund the paper, but he is instead trying to please Trump and make the Post less independent."
