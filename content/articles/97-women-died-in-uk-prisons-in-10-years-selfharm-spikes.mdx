title: "97 Women Died in UK Prisons in 10 Years; Self‑Harm Spikes"
summary: "Over the last ten years, 97 women have died inside prisons in England and Wales, and self‑harm incidents have reached a record high, a charity report says. The study used government data and points to failures such as missed health checks, slow responses to cell bells, and poor mental‑health support. Most women are in prison for short, low‑level crimes and many have mental illness, addiction or abuse histories. The findings push for closing women’s prisons and major reforms."
