title: "Why Keir Starmer’s speeches feel out of touch"
summary: "In Britain, voters now favour politicians who speak plainly and confidently, like Farage or Trump. Old‑school political talk—full of jargon and stiff delivery—has lost its appeal. Starmer’s careful, formal style, even on TikTok, feels dated and hard to understand, which hurts his party’s chances. The article argues that leaders must adapt to the new, direct way people want to hear about politics."
