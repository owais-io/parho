title: "Hotels, Pubs, Clubs Ask for More Rate Relief as Heathrow Gets Huge Discount"
summary: "UK hotels, restaurants and nightclubs are pressing the government for more help with business rates after a £900m discount was granted to Heathrow over the next three years. The airport’s relief is a fifth of the £4.3bn transitional relief fund that should cover all businesses. Hospitality venues say the rate cuts – capped at 15% this year – won’t keep them afloat as costs rise and many clubs have already closed."
