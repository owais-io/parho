title: "Half of UK job cuts since Labour took office hit people under 25"
summary: "Since Labour won the election, 170,000 jobs have vanished, and almost half of those losses involve workers under 25. Youth unemployment is now 15.3 %—the worst since 2015—and long‑term youth joblessness is at a decade high. Critics blame the new National Insurance tax on businesses that hire young workers, and a review by Alan Milburn has been set up to find a fix. The government plans a “Youth Guarantee” to give jobs to anyone on universal credit for 18 months who hasn’t worked or studied."
