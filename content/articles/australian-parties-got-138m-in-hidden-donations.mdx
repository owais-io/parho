title: "Australian Parties Got $138M in Hidden Donations"
summary: "Australian political parties got more than $138 million in donations that were not publicly disclosed. The money, called “dark money”, came from sources that stayed hidden because they were below the current $16,900 disclosure limit. New laws will lower that limit to $5,000, require monthly reporting, and cap how much a party can receive from one donor at $50,000. Transparency experts say the changes aren’t enough to stop big donors from influencing politics."
