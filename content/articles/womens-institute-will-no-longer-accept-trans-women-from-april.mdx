title: "Women’s Institute will no longer accept trans women from April"
summary: "The Women’s Institute (WI), a 110‑year‑old group for women, said it will no longer let trans women join from April after the UK Supreme Court ruled “woman” means a biological woman. WI’s chief executive said it had no choice but to change the rule, even though it still says trans women are women. The WI will create “sisterhood groups” open to all, but many members feel hurt."
