title: "How Europe Can Stop Trump From Taking Greenland"
summary: "Trump wants the US to control Greenland for “national security.” Denmark owns the island, but it’s part of the EU and NATO, which gives the territory extra protection. European leaders can try diplomacy, reassure the US about existing defence deals, and offer more security in the Arctic. They could also threaten economic sanctions, invest heavily in Greenland, or send EU troops to show support. These moves aim to keep Greenland under Danish/European control and avoid a US takeover."
