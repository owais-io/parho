title: "Trump‑favored Bloggers Take Over Pentagon Press Corps"
summary: "After many mainstream reporters quit the Pentagon press office, a new group of pro‑Trump bloggers and online personalities got press passes. They praised a U.S. raid in Venezuela and framed it as a heroic, legal mission, while being limited to official Pentagon information. Experts say these new reporters lack the independence needed to hold the military accountable. With a confrontational president, critics worry this biased media will keep the public misinformed."
