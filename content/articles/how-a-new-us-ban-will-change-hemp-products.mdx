title: "How a New US Ban Will Change Hemp Products"
summary: "A federal law banning most hemp‑derived items, like CBD oils and THC drinks, will kick in in November 2026. In states that already allow legal hemp, people can still buy products but only within their state and online sales will shrink. Prices are set to rise because companies will face higher taxes and lose the ability to ship between states. THC‑containing drinks could disappear from liquor stores, and pure CBD products may lose some of their effects without the tiny amount of THC they normally contain."
