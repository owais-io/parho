title: "Cornwall’s first geothermal plant powers homes and makes lithium"
summary: "A new geothermal plant near Redruth in Cornwall has started making clean electricity and extracting lithium from hot underground water. It uses deep wells to pull up 190 °C water, runs a turbine to generate power for 10,000 homes, then cools the water to pull out lithium for batteries. The project is Britain’s first of its kind, creates 100 local jobs, and could supply enough lithium for 250,000 electric cars each year."
