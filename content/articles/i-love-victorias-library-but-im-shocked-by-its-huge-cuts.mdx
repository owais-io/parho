title: "I love Victoria’s library, but I’m shocked by its huge cuts"
summary: "I’ve loved Victoria’s State Library since I was 12, and I’m stunned by the current plan to slash almost 40 jobs and cut reference librarians in half, leaving only 10. The library, visited by nearly 3 million people a year, relies on those staff to fight misinformation. Critics say the board is run by outsiders, and new projects—like a flashy Ned Kelly website and a corporate café lease—show a shift away from books toward a commercial venue."
