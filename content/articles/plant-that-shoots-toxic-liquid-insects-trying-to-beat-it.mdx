title: "Plant That Shoots Toxic Liquid, Insects Trying to Beat It"
summary: "In some bursera shrubs, a leaf acts like a squirt gun, blasting a toxic resin at insects that bite. The liquid is poisonous and hardens in air, trapping tiny bugs. It can shoot up to 1.5 metres and slow or kill larger insects too. Some beetles have learned to notch the leaf to sneak in, but they still grow slower and die sooner."
