title: "Santander launches 98% mortgage for first‑time buyers, but with strict limits"
summary: "Santander has launched a 5‑year fixed mortgage that lets first‑time buyers borrow up to 98% of a property's value, requiring only a £10,000 deposit. The deal is limited: it can't be used for flats, new builds, properties in Northern Ireland, or by self‑employed buyers, and the maximum loan is £500,000. Experts say these strict rules mean only a small group of buyers will benefit."
