title: "England Faces Water Shortages: What to Expect"
summary: "England is seeing real water shortages, like the town of Tunbridge Wells that ran out of running water for days. The problem is that water companies, owned by private investors, have not fixed old pipes or built new treatment plants because they focus on profits. If the situation worsens, more towns will face outages. The government says it will change water bills to pay more fairly, but many still doubt it will fix the problem."
