title: "Patagonia's Oldest Trees Destroyed by Climate‑Fueled Fires"
summary: "Scientists say the January wildfires in Chile and Argentina were made about three times more likely by global warming. The fires, which burned hot, dry and windy, killed 23 people, destroyed over a thousand homes and sent 52,000 people on the run. They also destroyed the 3,000‑year‑old alerce trees in Los Alerces National Park. Cuts to fire‑fighting budgets and non‑native tree plantations worsened the damage."
