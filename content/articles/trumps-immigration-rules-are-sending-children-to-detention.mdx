title: "Trump’s Immigration Rules Are Sending Children to Detention"
summary: "ICE has started detaining thousands of immigrant children and their families inside the U.S., not just at the border. In Minneapolis, a five‑year‑old was taken into custody after his dad fled, sparking outrage. Over 3,800 kids were booked into family detention in 2025, many kept in poorly equipped sites. Trump‑era rules aim to keep families until they’re removed, ignoring protections that say unaccompanied minors shouldn’t be held."
