title: "Gen Z Shoppers: Cheap, Experience‑Seekers Redefine Retail"
summary: "Gen Z shoppers are slashing holiday spending and hunting for value, so retailers must sell more than just products. The generation, often juggling credit‑card debt, loves cheaper copies, experiences, and loyalty perks. Malls are turning into social hubs with music and pop‑ups to attract them. Brands that connect emotionally and offer good deals win trust, while hard‑selling tactics backfire. Spending could hit $12 trillion by 2030, but this year they cut holiday spend by 23%."
