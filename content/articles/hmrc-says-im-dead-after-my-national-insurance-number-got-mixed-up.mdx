title: "HMRC says I’m dead after my national insurance number got mixed up"
summary: "The tax office has mixed up my national insurance number with that of a dead person. Because of the mistake, HMRC now says I’m deceased and will refuse my pension request. I’ve tried to fix it for years, spent hours on the phone, and was told I could wait 86 weeks. The only fix is to apply for a brand‑new NI number, which may still take months. HMRC is offering £250 compensation, but many are still worried about lost benefits."
