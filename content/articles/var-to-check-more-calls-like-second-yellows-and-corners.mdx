title: "VAR to Check More Calls Like Second Yellows and Corners"
summary: "The International Football Association Board has agreed to let the video assistant referee (VAR) check more decisions, such as second yellow cards and corners, as long as it doesn’t slow the game. It also added an eight‑second rule for goalkeepers to hand over the ball, and a 10‑second limit for substituted players. The changes aim to speed up play but are expected to upset fans who already hate video‑ref delays."
