title: "Abigail Spanberger to Deliver Democratic Response to Trump"
summary: "Abigail Spanberger, the moderate Democrat who beat a Republican in Virginia, has been chosen to deliver the Democratic response to President Trump’s State of the Union. The move shows Democrats leaning toward centrist leaders ahead of the mid‑terms. Spanberger’s record—ending ICE agreements, pushing redistricting and a firm stance on policing—has earned her both praise and attacks. While progressives push for a more left‑leaning nominee, the party is testing the middle ground."
