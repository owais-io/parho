title: "Labour’s Biggest Problem: The Middle Class Is Under Pressure"
summary: "After the 2008 crash, politicians realised the middle class—homeowners and families—were the ones feeling the squeeze. Today, wages are stuck and household income grows only 0.5% a year, so new tax plans will push many into higher brackets. Local services are cut and the government talks about immigration while ignoring ordinary people’s struggles. Labour’s focus on former industrial seats may leave the middle class feeling abandoned."
