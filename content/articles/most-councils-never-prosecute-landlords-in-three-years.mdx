title: "Most councils never prosecute landlords in three years"
summary: "Most councils in England haven’t taken legal action against any landlord in the last three years, even though they received about 300,000 complaints about bad homes. Only 640 landlords were fined and 4,702 penalty notices were issued—just a tiny fraction of the complaints. Cuts to enforcement staff and a new Renters’ Rights Act in 2026 will only help if more money is added. Tenants like Maya Jagger have struggled to get help."
