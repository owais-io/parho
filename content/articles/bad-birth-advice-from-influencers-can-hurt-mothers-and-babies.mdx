title: "Bad Birth Advice From Influencers Can Hurt Mothers and Babies"
summary: "The Guardian found that the Free Birth Society (FBS), a group that trains women to give birth without doctors, is linked to 48 serious cases, including stillbirths. Many people turn to FBS because they distrust hospitals or want “natural” care, but giving birth alone is riskier for both mother and baby. The NHS is already struggling to keep maternity units safe, and tech companies often push extreme tips. The article calls for better rules and more reliable information so people can make safer choices about birth."
