title: "UK net migration drops 69% – Labour's lukewarm praise"
summary: "Net migration in the UK fell 69% to 204,000 last year, a huge drop that surprised many. Labour leader Keir Starmer called it a “step in the right direction”, but critics say he glosses over the issue. Experts point out that the rise after Brexit was driven by the Ukraine scheme, Hong Kong passports, more student and care worker visas, not a deliberate open‑border policy. The drop shows migration is falling, but Labour still needs a clear plan."
