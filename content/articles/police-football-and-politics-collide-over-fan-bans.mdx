summary: "The letter argues that policing has become too political. Critics from all sides demanded West Midlands chief constable Craig Guildford resign after he banned Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a match. Politicians like Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy pressured the police, yet the ban was kept. The writer claims anti‑Jewish sentiment was misused and that the real problem is hooliganism, not antisemitism, and questions why Israeli teams can play while their government is criticized."
