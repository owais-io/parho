title: "Milano Cortina Winter Olympics: A Legacy of Excess and Climate Challenges"
summary: "The 2026 Winter Games in northern Italy are the biggest yet, but they expose problems of running a massive event. Organisers built new venues, used huge amounts of water to make artificial snow, and cut through forests. Many cities have pulled out of hosting due to cost, public backlash and climate worries. The IOC spreads the Games across several towns to keep costs down, but the financial and environmental toll is rising."
