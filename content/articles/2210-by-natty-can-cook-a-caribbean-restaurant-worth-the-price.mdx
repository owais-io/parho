title: "2210 By Natty Can Cook: A Caribbean Restaurant Worth the Price"
summary: "2210 By Natty Can Cook is a new, upscale Caribbean spot in Herne Hill that aims for a Michelin star. Chef Nathaniel Mortley serves dishes like ackee spring rolls, jerk chicken, and seared duck, all presented in a stylish, almost fancy‑dinner vibe. Prices are on the higher side – starters about £12, mains around £30 – but the food feels special and the setting makes it feel like a special occasion. Mortley’s quirky backstory, including time in Brixton prison, adds an interesting twist to the restaurant’s identity."
