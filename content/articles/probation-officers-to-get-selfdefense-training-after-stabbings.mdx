title: "Probation Officers to Get Self‑Defense Training After Stabbings"
summary: "After two stabbing attacks at probation offices, the government is equipping about 6,000 officers in England and Wales with self‑defence training, first‑aid kits, body‑worn cameras and metal‑detecting wands. The measures aim to protect staff who handle a growing caseload of over 240,000 community‑supervised people, many of whom are dangerous ex‑prisoners. Staff unions say the attacks have made workers fearful, and they also face pay disputes that could lead to industrial action."
