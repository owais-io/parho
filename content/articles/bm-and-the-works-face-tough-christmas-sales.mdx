title: "B&M and The Works Face Tough Christmas Sales"
summary: "B&M and The Works both saw weak Christmas sales. B&M cut its profit forecast after a 0.6% drop in UK sales, but said December sales improved after price cuts. The Works’ sales fell 4.2% because online orders crashed after a new delivery partner ran into trouble, and shoppers were wary amid rising prices and job cuts. Many UK retailers struggled, though a few like Wickes did better."
