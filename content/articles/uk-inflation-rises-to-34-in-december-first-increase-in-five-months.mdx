title: "UK inflation rises to 3.4% in December, first increase in five months"
summary: "Inflation in the UK climbed to 3.4% in December, up from 3.2% in November, marking the first rise in five months. The jump was largely driven by volatile items such as higher airfares and cigarette duties. The Bank of England will probably keep interest rates unchanged at 3.75% next month, with a cut expected in April if price pressures ease. The government is also pushing a budget aimed at cutting living costs."
