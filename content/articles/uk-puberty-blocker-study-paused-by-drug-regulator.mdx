title: "UK puberty blocker study paused by drug regulator"
summary: "UK researchers have put a pause on a study that tests puberty‑blocking drugs for children. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said the trial’s minimum age of 10‑12 is too low because long‑term side effects are not yet known. King’s College London will meet the regulator next week to raise the age to 14. The study was started after a review found the evidence for these drugs weak and the NHS has stopped routine use."
