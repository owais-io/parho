title: "Cursing Can Boost Your Performance"
summary: "Researchers tested 192 people who repeated a swear word or a neutral word while doing chair push‑ups. Those who cursed stayed in the exercise about 11% longer, felt more confident, and entered a “flow” state that distracted them from the effort. The boost comes from shedding social restraints, not a heart‑rate rise. Scientists are exploring stronger curses and if the confidence lift helps in public speaking, but they warn it depends on context."
