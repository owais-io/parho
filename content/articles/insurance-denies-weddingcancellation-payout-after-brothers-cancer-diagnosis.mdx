title: "Insurance denies wedding‑cancellation payout after brother’s cancer diagnosis"
summary: "After her brother was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and had emergency surgery, a woman cancelled her wedding. She had bought cancellation insurance, but the insurer denied her claim because it said her brother had a pre‑existing condition. They offered £9,000, then pulled it back. She’s now out £22,000 and can’t afford a new wedding. The insurer has changed its forms and a financial ombudsman may decide the final outcome."
