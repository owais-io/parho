title: "Share Your PCOS Experience With Us"
summary: "More than one in ten women of child‑bearing age have PCOS, a hormone disorder that messes with metabolism, skin, mood, heart health and reproduction. Many people and doctors say the name “polycystic ovary syndrome” is misleading because it focuses only on ovarian cysts and hides the wider symptoms. A global group is trying to rename it to better reflect the disease. We’d love to hear how living with PCOS feels and what a new name would mean to you."
