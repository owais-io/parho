title: "COP30 agreements are weak and won’t protect fragile ecosystems"
summary: "At COP30, world leaders agreed on vague plans that won’t stop the climate crisis. They promised to triple climate‑adaptation money but the target is far below what poor countries need. Many nations still haven’t filed proper emissions plans, and the talks on cutting fossil‑fuel use were turned into voluntary discussions with no deadlines. The summit also left out hard words about fair mining of minerals for clean energy. Small steps are not enough – urgent action is needed."
