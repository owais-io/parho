summary: "Music venue owners in the UK are seeing a small uptick in gigs and new spaces, thanks to support from the Music Venue Trust, but the sector still struggles financially. In 2025, many venues made no profit, and a drop in the National Insurance threshold cut almost 6,000 jobs in a single year, mostly young workers. The trust calls for new policies to protect these local music hubs and keep the industry alive."
