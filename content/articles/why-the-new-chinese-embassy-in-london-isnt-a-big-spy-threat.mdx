title: "Why the new Chinese embassy in London isn’t a big spy threat"
summary: "London’s new Chinese embassy could look like a big spy hub, but experts say it’s not. MI5 thinks that with only one building, it’s actually easier to keep an eye on Chinese staff. Most Chinese officials will be working inside, but the real spy work usually happens back in China. A few covert jobs might be in the embassy, but the main threats are outside it. So the worry is bigger than the building itself."
