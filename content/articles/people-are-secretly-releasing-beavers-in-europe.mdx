title: "People Are Secretly Releasing Beavers in Europe"
summary: "In recent years, beavers have been found in places like Norfolk and Berkshire, but they didn't come from official projects. This is part of a trend called ‘beaver bombing,’ where people release animals without permission, thinking bureaucracy is too slow. The released beavers (and other species) often trace back to Bavaria. While some say it helps biodiversity, others worry about disease, ecological imbalance and whether the animals truly belong there. Who decides what can live here remains a hot debate."
