title: "Moderate Liberals Urge Leader Angus Taylor to Avoid Trump‑Style Immigration Bans"
summary: "Moderate Liberals warn Angus Taylor not to adopt hard‑line immigration plans that would ban migrants from 37 regions in 13 countries. They argue blanket bans hurt innocent people and don’t stop terrorism, calling for targeted, intelligence‑based security instead. While some party members push for Trump‑style bans, others warn the rhetoric could turn voters racist. The party risks losing moderate support if it takes a hard‑right stance."
