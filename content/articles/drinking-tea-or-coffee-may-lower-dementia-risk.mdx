title: "Drinking Tea or Coffee May Lower Dementia Risk"
summary: "People who drink 2‑3 cups of coffee or 1‑2 cups of tea each day may have a 15‑20 % lower risk of dementia, a study of more than 130,000 Americans found. Researchers followed participants for up to 40 years and saw the drinks linked to less cognitive decline, probably because caffeine and antioxidants help blood flow and reduce inflammation. Still, experts say we need more trials and encourage healthy habits like exercise, a balanced diet and good sleep."
