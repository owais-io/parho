summary: "A report by Article 19 shows Iran’s big internet shutdowns during protests were built with Chinese gadgets. Chinese firms supplied facial‑recognition cameras, GPS‑like BeiDou, and deep‑packet‑inspection tools from Huawei and ZTE. These devices let Iran filter, monitor, and censor online traffic, keeping millions cut off from the global web. The study highlights how China and Iran share a “cyber sovereignty” goal, using cheap, widely available tech for tight control."
