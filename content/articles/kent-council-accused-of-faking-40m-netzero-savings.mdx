title: "Kent Council Accused of Faking £40m Net‑Zero Savings"
summary: "The Reform‑run Kent Council said it had saved £39.5 m by canceling two net‑zero projects. A Labour MP asked for evidence. The council’s reply said the projects were only mentioned in one budget appendix, had no business case or funding, and were never approved. The MP called the claim a lie. The council says the figures are just future cost‑avoidance estimates. One council efficiency head has resigned, and a paid adviser was also criticised for controversial posts."
