title: "Trump Revokes Coal Pollution Rules, Letting Plants Emit More Mercury"
summary: "The Trump administration has undone stricter limits on mercury, lead and other toxins from coal plants that were set under Biden. Only about 27 of the 219 U.S. coal plants would have needed upgrades to meet the old rules, but the new rollback lets 71 plants get exemptions. The move raises health concerns, sparks lawsuits, and is part of a broader shift away from tighter environmental controls."
