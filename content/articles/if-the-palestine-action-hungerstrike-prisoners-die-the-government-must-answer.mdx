title: "If the Palestine Action hunger‑strike prisoners die, the government must answer"
summary: "Three prisoners from the Palestine Action group are on hunger strikes that have lasted 45 to 66 days. They’re being held for long remand periods—up to 20 months—while charged with ordinary crimes, not terrorism, yet treated like terrorists. They’re denied visits, jobs, books and can’t see family. UN experts and doctors warn of medical risks. The government has ignored calls for a conversation and may be morally responsible if they die."
