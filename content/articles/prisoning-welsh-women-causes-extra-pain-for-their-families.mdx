title: "Prisoning Welsh Women Causes Extra Pain for Their Families"
summary: "Because Wales has no women’s prison, those sentenced are sent to English facilities far from home. This distance puts extra strain on families, especially kids, and has been linked to a record‑high self‑harm rate in women’s prisons. The Welsh government wants community‑based residential centers instead of short prison terms, but a new Swansea project is still delayed. Many Welsh women—often survivors of abuse—are stuck several hours from their loved ones."
