summary: "Santander UK says the FCA's plan to pay back drivers overcharged for car loans is too big and unclear. The bank set aside £183m to compensate drivers and wants the government to step in. Meanwhile, Santander's Spanish parent announced a $12bn purchase of Webster Bank, boosting its U.S. presence. The deal could make Santander the 10th‑largest U.S. bank, but shares fell 3%.
