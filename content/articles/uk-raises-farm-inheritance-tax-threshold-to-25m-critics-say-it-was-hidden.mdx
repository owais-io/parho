title: "UK raises farm inheritance tax threshold to £2.5m, critics say it was hidden"
summary: "UK farmers will now only pay inheritance tax on farmland worth more than £2.5 million instead of £1 million. The change was announced by the government on a press release just before Christmas, which many say was done to avoid scrutiny. Farmers and some Labour MPs had urged the reversal, and the move cuts expected tax revenue from £430 million to about £300 million. The National Farmers’ Union welcomed the relief, but critics warn that some farms still may not afford the tax."
