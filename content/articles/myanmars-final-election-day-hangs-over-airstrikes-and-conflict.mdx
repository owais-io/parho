title: "Myanmar’s Final Election Day Hangs Over Airstrikes and Conflict"
summary: "On Sunday Myanmar held the last voting day of its disputed election. The junta says it’s fair, but the opposition party is banned and many voters can’t reach polls because fighting still rages. An airstrike killed 21 people in a village where displaced residents were sheltering. The military’s Union Solidarity and Development party is expected to win big, while international groups call the vote illegitimate. Roughly a third of the country is left out of the vote due to conflict."
