summary: "Trump’s new move takes away the EPA rule that says greenhouse gases threaten health. He says it’s a big win for the economy, but many worry it hurts people and the planet. At the same time, he’s traveling to North Carolina to talk to families at Fort Bragg and then meeting with the Chinese leader in Germany’s Munich Security Conference. Trump also talks about easing some high steel and aluminum tariffs, and he’s been reviewing a new flu vaccine from Moderna that the FDA isn’t looking at right now. In Minnesota, charges against two Venezuelan men who were shot by an immigration officer are being dropped because new evidence doesn’t match the government’s story. The U.S. is also keeping some temporary protections for Haitian immigrants after a court says it won’t pause them. That’s the gist of what’s happening."
