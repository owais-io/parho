title: "US Seed Ban Could Push Cannabis Genetics Underground, Growers Warn"
summary: "A new rule in a federal spending bill will ban most cannabis seeds in the US, saying any seed from a plant that could grow more than 0.3% THC is illegal. Growers say this makes no sense, since seeds look the same and only the finished plant shows THC levels. The ban would hurt home growers, especially patients who use cannabis for health, and could drive the seed market underground."
