title: "Dr. Oz Urges Americans to Get Measles Vaccine as Outbreaks Rise"
summary: "Dr. Oz, a well‑known TV doctor, urged Americans to get the measles vaccine after outbreaks spread to states such as South Carolina, Utah and Arizona. Children are the hardest hit, and most cases involve people who haven’t been vaccinated. Public health experts warn that growing vaccine skepticism could bring back a disease the U.S. had once eliminated. No national campaign has yet been announced, so Oz’s call comes as a first major push from Washington."
