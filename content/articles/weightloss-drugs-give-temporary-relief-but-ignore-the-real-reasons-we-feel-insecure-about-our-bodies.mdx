title: "Weight‑loss drugs give temporary relief but ignore the real reasons we feel insecure about our bodies"
summary: "GLP‑1 pills and injections let people lose weight quickly, so many feel less worried about food and body shape. But the drugs don’t teach people to change habits or stop the pressure from food, beauty and fashion industries. The medication only works while you keep taking it, and most people regain weight after stopping. A deeper look at why we’re anxious about eating and bodies is needed, starting from childhood."
