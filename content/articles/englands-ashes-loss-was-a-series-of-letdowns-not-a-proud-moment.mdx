title: "England’s Ashes loss was a series of letdowns, not a proud moment"
summary: "England went to Perth expecting a bold new team, but the Ashes ended 4‑1 in Australia’s favour, with England losing the trophy early. A few bright spots saw Jacob Bethell score 154 and Josh Tongue take 18 wickets, but overall the side struggled to adapt. The ECB said poor planning and player behaviour hurt the campaign, and an internal review will follow. Fans saw England miss the chance to shine."
