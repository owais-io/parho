title: "Sydney extends protest ban for 14 days, activists plan court challenge"
summary: "Sydney police have kept a 14‑day ban on new protest approvals after the Bondi terror incident. The rule blocks organisers from getting the usual government form that shields protests from arrest. Activists, including the Palestine Action Group, say it silences free speech and will sue in court. The ban could keep future rallies, like the 26‑January Invasion Day protests, from getting official permission. Critics fear it limits civil liberties."
