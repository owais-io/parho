title: "Labour Ignored Middle‑Class Problems, Risking Its Own Future"
summary: "John Harris writes that the middle class is left behind. Even after paying off cheap mortgages, people still face high housing costs, insufficient state pensions and double taxes on pensions. Waiting for NHS appointments can take months, forcing some to pay for private care. With more retirees, the NHS is strained. Harris argues that Labour should tackle these growing problems instead of piecemeal budgets."
