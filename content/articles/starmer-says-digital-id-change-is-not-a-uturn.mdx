title: "Starmer Says Digital ID Change Is Not a U‑Turn"
summary: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the latest tweak to his digital ID plan isn’t a U‑turn. The change drops a rule that only a specific digital ID card could prove right to work, instead allowing passports or e‑visas with a chip. Starmer insists the core idea remains: everyone will still need to show a digital ID when hired, to stop illegal work. Conservatives called the move chaotic."
