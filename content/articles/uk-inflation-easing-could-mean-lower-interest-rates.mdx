title: "UK inflation easing could mean lower interest rates"
summary: "UK inflation fell from 3.8 % to 3.6 % in October, showing a slowdown that might signal an interest‑rate cut. The government plans a budget that could lower energy taxes and curb price rises, while the Bank of England’s policy board is split between keeping rates high and easing them. Governor Andrew Bailey voted to keep rates at 4 % for now, but markets expect a cut in December."
