title: "WHO keeps coca leaf on drug list, hurting Andean farmers"
summary: "WHO said coca leaf stays on the same drug list as cocaine, even though scientists say it’s harmless. The decision blocks Andean growers in Bolivia and Colombia from selling coca products legally, forcing them to sell to the illegal cocaine market. Farmers feel their culture is being erased and that the move hurts their livelihoods and national sovereignty. Governments have tried to reclassify the leaf, but the United Nations' rules and the US's influence keep it restricted."
