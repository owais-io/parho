title: "Trump’s threat to bomb Iran won’t build democracy"
summary: "Trump recently threatened to bomb Iran, echoing his earlier use of a massive bomb in Afghanistan. The piece argues that dropping bombs cannot force a democratic change in Iran. Instead, the US should use sanctions, diplomacy and support for Iranian civil society to push for reforms. A peaceful, internal push for a secular constitution and human rights is needed, not military action."
