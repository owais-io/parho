title: "Trump Says the UK Must Keep the Chagos Islands, Not Return Them to Mauritius"
summary: "Trump warned Keir Starmer that giving the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius is a mistake. The islands, part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, host a US‑UK military base on Diego Garcia. The UK wants to transfer sovereignty to Mauritius but keep a lease for the base. Trump’s comments come after the US State Department supports the deal. Meanwhile, the UK issued removal orders to Chagossians who landed on the islands, and the UN says the deal may violate rights."
