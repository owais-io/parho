title: "Bank of England lowers rates to 3.75% to help the UK economy before Christmas"
summary: "The Bank of England has lowered its main interest rate to 3.75% in a sixth cut since Labour took office. The decision was a close 5‑4 vote, showing some worry about inflation still being high. The cut comes after data showed inflation dropping to 3.2%, but still above the 2% goal. Bank officials say future cuts will be decided case‑by‑case, while employers expect wages to keep rising. Meanwhile, the economy has slowed and government cost‑of‑living measures aim to ease the pressure."
