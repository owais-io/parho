title: "Business groups ask Tory peers to let Labour’s workers’ rights bill pass"
summary: "Britain’s biggest business groups have urged Conservative Lords to stop voting down a Labour workers’ rights bill. The bill would give workers protection from unfair dismissal and a six‑month period to claim. The groups fear that if the bill isn’t passed before Parliament closes for Christmas, a compromise with trade unions could be lost. Ministers say they’ll try to push the bill through before the holidays."
