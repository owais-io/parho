title: "England to Freeze Train Fares in 2026"
summary: "The UK government will stop train fares from rising in England in 2026, the first pause in 30 years. The freeze is part of a budget that also aims to cut living costs and tackle the national debt. Passengers could save up to £300 a year on main routes, while commuters on flexi‑season tickets could see savings of a few hundred pounds. Train companies may still raise other ticket types, but regulated fares will stay flat."
