title: "Temporary homes in England are torture for neurodivergent children"
summary: "A new report from King’s College says that temporary housing in England is basically torture for children with neurodiversity. It says 172,000 kids live in cramped, noisy, constantly moving homes that mess with routines and cause anxiety, hyper‑alertness and trauma. Parents report that moving often, lack of space, and noisy neighbours leave children withdrawn or on edge. The study calls the situation child cruelty and urges lawmakers to add child‑rights rules to housing laws."
