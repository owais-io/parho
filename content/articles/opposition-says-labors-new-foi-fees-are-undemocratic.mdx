title: "Opposition Says Labor’s New FOI Fees Are Undemocratic"
summary: "The Labor government wants to add fees for freedom‑of‑information requests and limit the documents that can be released. Opposition and cross‑bench senators say the changes are undemocratic and would hurt transparency. The bill would add a 40‑hour deadline, switch 30‑day replies to business days, and let officers refuse or redraft policy drafts. No proof has shown a spike in fake requests. The government says it will review the proposal."
