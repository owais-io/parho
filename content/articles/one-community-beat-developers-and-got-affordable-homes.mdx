title: "One Community Beat Developers and Got Affordable Homes"
summary: "Battersea Power Station in London was bought by Malaysian investors for £400 m. The redevelopment turned the area into a playground for the rich, with luxury stores and super‑expensive apartments. Residents worried they would be pushed out, as has happened elsewhere. Wandsworth council negotiated with developers and won a deal for 203 council homes and other affordable housing. The win shows local governments can protect communities and keep mixed‑income neighborhoods in the city."
