title: "Syrian Businesses Struggle to Adapt After Assad’s Fall"
summary: "After President Assad was toppled, shops in coastal towns have swapped regime‑era souvenirs for new flags and rebel photos, but tourists are fewer and sales slow. In the countryside, a family winery that once faced harassment now can make wine but can’t legally sell it because new laws are unclear. Bars face sudden shut‑downs and uncertain licenses. Even as people celebrate freedom, businesses are stuck waiting for clear rules."
