title: "UK citizenship row over old tweets sparks debate on what it means to be British"
summary: "The UK is being asked to strip Egyptian‑British activist Alaa Abd el‑Fattah of his citizenship after old racist tweets were found. Politicians from both sides of the aisle, including the Conservatives and Reform UK, call for revocation, while Downing Street insists he has the same rights as any citizen. The case highlights a growing debate about Britishness, with many people now seeing it as a birthright rather than a value‑based identity. Similar dual‑national cases, like those of Nazanin Zaghari‑Ratcliffe and Jimmy Lai, show how complex citizenship can be in the UK."
