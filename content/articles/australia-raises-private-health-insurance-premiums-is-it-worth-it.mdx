title: "Australia Raises Private Health Insurance Premiums – Is It Worth It?"
summary: "Australia’s health ministry approved a 4.41 % rise in private health insurance premiums, the steepest increase in almost ten years. With interest rates already up, many Australians are questioning whether the extra cost gives better protection or just higher bills. Experts say the current system is confusing, lacks transparency and pushes people into cover to avoid tax penalties, not because they need it. The debate is growing over whether to reform or scrap private insurance."
