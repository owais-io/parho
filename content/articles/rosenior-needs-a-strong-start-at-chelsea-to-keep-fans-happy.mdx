title: "Rosenior Needs a Strong Start at Chelsea to Keep Fans Happy"
summary: "Rosenior already knows how Chelsea’s owners run the club and will have to work inside that system. He isn’t taking over a crisis team, but he’ll need to improve discipline and keep a lead. Fans are unhappy with the new ownership and already doubt Rosenior will simply follow orders. Past managers faced similar backlash, so he must win the crowd’s trust while handling a young squad. The challenge is big: top‑four hopes, cup ties, and a quick result needed."
