title: "How Hormones, Sleep, and Food Shape Your Metabolism"
summary: "Endocrinologists explain that hormones like insulin and cortisol control how your body burns calories. Too much insulin can slow metabolism and lead to weight gain, while stress raises cortisol and hurts energy balance. They suggest eating more protein, cutting carbs, and moving the body with simple strength exercises. Good sleep, eating earlier, and avoiding long periods of sitting also help. Hormone injections can lower insulin but should be used with care and good information."
