title: "Water companies may have pollution fines delayed or cancelled under new government plan"
summary: "Water companies may have pollution fines delayed or cancelled to keep them from going bankrupt, but the government says they will still pay eventually. The new plan introduces stricter inspections, a “turnaround regime” to help failing firms, and a single regulator to manage enforcement. Campaigners say this lets polluters off the hook, while the industry welcomes the fresh oversight for customers."
