title: "New Towns Keep Us Car‑Dependent"
summary: "The letter argues that new towns like Gilston spread out over large areas, far from train stations, making people rely on cars. Developers cut affordable housing targets and use planning rules to keep costs low, leaving little real social housing. They also avoid building the roads, schools, and services needed. The author laments slow planning timelines and empty buildings that could be fixed instead of new, car‑heavy schemes."
