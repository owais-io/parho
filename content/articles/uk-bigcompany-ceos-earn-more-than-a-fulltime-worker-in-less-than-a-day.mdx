title: "UK Big‑Company CEOs Earn More Than a Full‑Time Worker in Less Than a Day"
summary: "In 2026, CEOs of the FTSE 100 made as much as the average UK worker in about 28 hours. Their median pay is £4.4 million, 113 times the £39,039 earned by a typical full‑time employee. The report shows a huge pay gap, with top bosses earning over £1,350 an hour. Trade unions say the gap is growing and call for more worker say‑on‑pay committees and stricter tax rules on large bonuses."
