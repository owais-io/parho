title: "Trump backs out of Chagos Islands deal after UK blocks use of Diego Garcia for Iran strikes"
summary: "Trump said he had changed his mind about a deal that would let Britain keep an airbase on Diego Garcia while giving the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius. He said the UK would not let the base be used for a possible strike on Iran, so he no longer supports the agreement. The UK and the UK’s new Labour government are still trying to get the deal through Parliament, but the US position could affect it."
