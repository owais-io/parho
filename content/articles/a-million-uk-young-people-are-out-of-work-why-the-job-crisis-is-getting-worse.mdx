title: "A million UK young people are out of work – why the job crisis is getting worse"
summary: "About a million young Brits are not in school or work and are struggling to find jobs. New data shows 946,000 people aged 16‑24, called Neets, are on the edge of society. The government is looking at disability and mental health, and the next budget will focus on helping them. COVID, bad job‑centre experience, AI cutting entry‑level roles and a weak education system all make it harder for these young people to get jobs."
