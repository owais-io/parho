title: "Why I’m grateful to write for The Guardian"
summary: "In the U.S., many big media companies are owned by billionaires who push their own interests, and the Trump era has turned press into a target of lawsuits and regulatory threats. Many outlets have toned down criticism to stay safe. The Guardian, however, has no billionaire owner and is funded by readers, so it can challenge power and keep independent reporting. The writer thanks readers for supporting the free press."
