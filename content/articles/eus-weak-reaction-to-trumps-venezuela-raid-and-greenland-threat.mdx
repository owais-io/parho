title: "EU’s weak reaction to Trump’s Venezuela raid and Greenland threat"
summary: "After Trump’s US forces attacked Venezuela’s president and announced plans to take Greenland, EU leaders stayed quiet. The European Commission talked only about travel and consumer rights, avoiding criticism of the raid. Some EU heads called the US move illegitimate, but most were cautious, fearing anger from Trump and hurting US‑EU ties. In contrast, Denmark and several EU countries firmly rejected Trump’s Greenland threat, saying the territory belongs to its people, but no real steps have been taken yet."
