title: "Hollywood's Secret Rule: Never Be Completely Honest"
summary: "Living in Los Angeles, the writer explains that Hollywood has a hidden rule: never give honest, blunt criticism. Even when friends or colleagues ask for feedback, people say what will keep others happy instead of the truth. He cites Quentin Tarantino, who loudly slammed actor Paul Dano and even past films, as an example of breaking that unwritten pact. The piece ends with the author admitting he'll keep lying because no one truly practices honesty in the industry."
