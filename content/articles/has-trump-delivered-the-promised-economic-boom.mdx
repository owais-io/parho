title: "Has Trump Delivered the Promised Economic Boom?"
summary: "Trump said the U.S. economy would boom and create a ‘golden age’, but the numbers don’t match. Jobs grew only a little, and unemployment is higher than it was before. Factory jobs haven’t risen, and tariffs were raised to record levels, then cut back. Prices stay high and many experts think the policies help the wealthy but hurt most people. Economists expect only modest growth next year."
