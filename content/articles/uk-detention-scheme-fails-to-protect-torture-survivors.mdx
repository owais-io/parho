title: "UK detention scheme fails to protect torture survivors"
summary: "Medical Justice, a charity that sends doctors to immigration centres, says the Home Office’s “one in, one out” policy is not keeping torture survivors safe. They studied 33 people waiting to be sent back to France and found 18 had clear signs of torture or trafficking. The report says the system ignores their health needs, leaving them exposed to violence, threats and physical abuse during removal. It calls for ending the scheme and handling asylum claims in the UK instead."
