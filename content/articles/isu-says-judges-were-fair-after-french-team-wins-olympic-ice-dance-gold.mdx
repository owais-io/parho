title: "ISU Says Judges Were Fair After French Team Wins Olympic Ice Dance Gold"
summary: "ISU said the judges were fair after a French ice‑dance pair won gold at the Olympics. A single judge gave the French team almost eight points more than the Americans, and that difference decided the race. The ISU explained that the judging system discards the highest and lowest marks to reduce bias, so the French judge’s big score was largely removed. Fans signed a petition asking for an investigation, but the ISU says it rarely reviews scores."
