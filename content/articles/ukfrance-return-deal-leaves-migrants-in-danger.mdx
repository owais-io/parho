title: "UK‑France Return Deal Leaves Migrants in Danger"
summary: "In July, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed on a new deal: for every boat that lands in the UK, one person will be sent back to France. Only a few dozen people have been returned so far, but the scheme has already caused problems. Those sent back say they face violence from smugglers and are often sent back again. Human‑rights experts warn the deal may break international law and leave many migrants in danger."
