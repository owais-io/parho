title: "Investor Michael Flacks Eyes British Steel Takeover"
summary: "Michael Flacks, a Miami‑based investor, is looking to buy the UK’s government‑owned steel plant at Scunthorpe. He plans to pair it with his planned purchase of Italy’s Ilva plant, creating a big European steel group. The deal would need huge investment to replace old blast furnaces with cleaner electric ones. Flacks says the move will protect jobs and bring steel production back to Europe. The UK government is still weighing options."
