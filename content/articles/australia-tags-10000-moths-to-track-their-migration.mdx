summary: "Australia is tagging 10,000 bogong moths with tiny confetti‑sized paper tags glued with eyelash adhesive. Scientists and volunteers will attach tags at Mount Kosciuszko, then people across the southeast will watch for marked moths at special homes. First time the species is tracked, the study will reveal where the moths breed and fly, helping protect them and the animals that rely on them."
