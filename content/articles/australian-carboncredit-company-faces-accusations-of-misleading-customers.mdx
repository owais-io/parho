title: "Australian carbon‑credit company faces accusations of misleading customers"
summary: "A new Australian carbon‑credit company, Aetium, is being criticised for selling credits for solar panels, electric cars and forests that may not actually cut extra emissions. Climate Integrity says the company’s scheme ignores the key “additionality” rule that credits must be for extra reductions. More than 4,000 projects have been listed, but Aetium hasn’t sold or certified any credits yet. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is looking into the claims."
