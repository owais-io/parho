title: "UK Leaders Use Burner Phones and Lead‑Line Bags to Beat Chinese Surveillance"
summary: "When UK leaders travel to China, they keep their phones and email on a strict security regime. They use disposable “burner” phones, temporary email addresses, and even lead‑lined bags to keep mobile devices safe from Chinese bugs. The team also follows strict rules to avoid eye‑watering surveillance. These precautions mean ministers can’t easily talk to families or receive messages, sometimes causing political headaches. The measures have been in place for years and are standard when dealing with suspected Chinese spying."
