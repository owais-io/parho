title: "Atlantic Salmon Return to Three Rivers in England After 10 Years"
summary: "For the first time since 2015, young Atlantic salmon have been seen in three north‑west England rivers – the Mersey, Bollin and Goyt. The fish, which spend years in the Arctic before returning to spawn, are now showing up again, a sign the environment is getting better. The Environment Agency will study their spread next year. Salmon still face climate change, pollution, invasive species and river barriers."
