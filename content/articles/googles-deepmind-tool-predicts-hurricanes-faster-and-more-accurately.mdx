title: "Google’s DeepMind Tool Predicts Hurricanes Faster and More Accurately"
summary: "Google’s new DeepMind AI model is helping meteorologists spot storms that could quickly strengthen into powerful hurricanes. In the 2024 season, the model outperformed traditional weather forecasts, correctly predicting the path and rapid intensification of storms like Melissa, which hit Jamaica as a Category 5. Although the AI’s inner workings are not fully transparent, its speed and accuracy give forecasters and residents more time to prepare, potentially saving lives and property."
