title: "UK’s New Nuclear Plan Could Weaken Environmental Rules"
summary: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pushing a review that would let nuclear plants be built faster and cheaper. The plan could also loosen strict environmental rules that protect wildlife. Critics say this would hurt Britain’s biodiversity and could clash with the EU’s trade deal. While the government says the changes will help grow the economy and reach net‑zero, many worry the loss of protections could cost ecosystems and future growth."
