summary: "UK data shows fewer asylum seekers are staying in hotels, dropping to an 18‑month low of 30,657 people by December.

Total asylum applications fell 4% last year to about 100,000, while small‑boat arrivals rose 13% to nearly 46,000, mostly from Eritrea. The grant rate fell to 42% from 47% last year."
