title: "Sydney Water’s Sewage Outlets Caused Beach‑Closing “Poo Balls”"
summary: "For 16 months, Sydney beaches were closed because of huge, foul “poo balls” that washed ashore. Investigations traced the debris to Sydney Water’s Malabar sewage plant’s deep‑water outfalls. The company and the government kept the facts hidden until a Guardian Freedom‑of‑Information request. The outfalls hold a fatberg that can’t be easily cleaned, and fixing it would shut beaches for months and cost billions, with political and funding hurdles."
