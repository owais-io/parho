summary: "Accenture has started calling all of its 800,000 staff “reinventors” to show it’s moving toward AI. The company merged several departments into one “Reinvention Services” unit, and the new label appears on its HR site and in daily talk. It is training employees in generative AI, but those who can’t learn new skills may be let go. The shift comes as Accenture’s stock is falling after US budget cuts."
