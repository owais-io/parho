title: "Give Your Old Clothes a New Life and Save the Planet"
summary: "Australia buys 1.5 billion new clothes each year, but half of unwanted items go to landfill. A new brand, Kowtow, turns textile waste into bio‑char that can grow tomatoes, turning trash into useful soil. The piece says we should re‑wear, repair, donate and recycle, and that producers need to use cleaner fabrics. Small local drives help, but the biggest change comes from buying less and choosing clothes that last."
