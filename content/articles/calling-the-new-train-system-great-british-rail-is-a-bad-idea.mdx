title: "Calling the New Train System “Great British Rail” Is a Bad Idea"
summary: "The article says naming the new rail network “Great British Railways” is misleading and pretentious. It points out that the word “Great” has been used to sell British pride, especially during Brexit, but the rail system needs to be seen as efficient, not as a nostalgic boast. The author suggests simpler names like “Railways UK” that avoid hype and better reflect the service. It also warns that similar “Great British” branding could backfire on other public projects."
