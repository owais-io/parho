title: "Replacing Factory‑Farmed Meat with Lab‑Grown and Plant‑Based Options"
summary: "Bruce Friedrich argues that we can end the industrial livestock industry by swapping animal meat for lab‑grown or plant‑based proteins that taste the same but cost less. He says meat is a huge waste of crops and fuels climate change, yet people keep eating it as incomes rise. If these alternatives reach price and taste parity, they could replace most meat by 2050, improving food security and cutting health risks. Governments and big meat companies must back the technology."
