title: "Lawyers Oppose Bayer’s $7.25 bn Roundup Settlement"
summary: "A coalition of 14 law firms representing almost 20,000 Roundup users wants to stop Bayer’s $7.25 bn settlement. They say the deal mainly rewards occupational users, offers too low amounts to many people, and was negotiated behind closed doors. The firms want the court to extend the fast‑track approval and allow more public scrutiny. Bayer insists the plan is fair and awaits a U.S. Supreme Court hearing next month."
