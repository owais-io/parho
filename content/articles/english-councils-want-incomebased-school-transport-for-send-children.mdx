title: "English councils want income‑based school transport for SEND children"
summary: "Councils across England say the cost of sending children with SEND to school is growing too fast and ask the government to start a means‑testing system. The plan would mean families who earn above a certain level would pay for the bus or taxi that takes their child to school. Councils warn that this could leave disabled children without transport and keep them out of school. They want the new policy to be fair and to protect children’s rights."
