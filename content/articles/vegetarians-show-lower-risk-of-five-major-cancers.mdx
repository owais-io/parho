title: "Vegetarians Show Lower Risk of Five Major Cancers"
summary: "Researchers followed 1.8 million people for about 16 years. Vegetarians had 21% lower risk of pancreatic cancer, 12% lower for prostate, 9% lower for breast, 28% lower for kidney, and 31% lower for multiple myeloma compared to meat eaters. However, vegetarians and vegans had higher risks of oesophageal and bowel cancers, likely because of missing nutrients. The study suggests the meat itself may raise cancer risk, but more work is needed."
