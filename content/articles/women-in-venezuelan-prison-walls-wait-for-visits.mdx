title: "Women in Venezuelan prison walls wait for visits"
summary: "The photo shows women inside Venezuela’s Poli‑Valencia prison, turning an old office into a cramped cell. They paint names, draw hearts and hold each other to keep some sense of self. Life there is hard – no water, no food, long wait for visits, and no clear trial dates. Two women stand out: Daniela, who lost her daughter to leukemia, and Roxana, a former addict now studying and writing a book."
