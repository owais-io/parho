title: "Debunking Five False Claims About Australia’s Net‑Zero Plan"
summary: "The article clears up five big mistakes the Coalition says about Australia reaching net zero by 2050. The $9 trillion cost claim is wrong – the real cost is about $300 billion, and most money would come from overseas, not taxpayers. Electricity prices rose after the Ukraine war and higher gas prices, not because of renewables. Net zero still keeps Australia in the Paris Agreement, and most emission cuts so far were from state policies and more green power, not federal action. Carbon‑capture projects haven’t shown real results."
