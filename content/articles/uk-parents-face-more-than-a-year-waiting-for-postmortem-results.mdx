title: "UK parents face more than a year waiting for post‑mortem results"
summary: "Parents across the UK are waiting more than a year to find out why their child died because there aren't enough specialist doctors to perform post‑mortem tests. A Royal College of Pathologists report says services are collapsing and 37% of consultant posts are empty. In some areas babies’ bodies have to be sent to other hospitals. The delays hurt families’ healing and prevent useful information for future pregnancies."
