title: "Green Party Leader Polanski Will Team Up With Burnham, Not Starmer, to Fight Reform"
summary: "Green Party leader Zack Polanski said he would team up with Labour’s Andy Burnham but not with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to keep the Reform group out of government. He wants a coalition after the next election, so the Greens need enough seats and Burnham must become an MP again. Polanski also slammed Labour’s economic plans, calling for a wealth tax and higher capital‑gains tax. He added he’d reject a partnership with Starmer."
