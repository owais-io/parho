title: "St Pancras will stop using diesel trains by 2026"
summary: "St Pancras and King’s Cross are getting cleaner trains. East Midlands Railway will stop using diesel engines at St Pancras by the end of 2026. New electric‑bi‑mode Aurora trains will run on electricity until just south of Leicester, cutting emissions by 66%. The rail network still has many diesel trains, but new technology and more electrification could help. The move shows progress, though full electric coverage still faces delays and cost issues."
