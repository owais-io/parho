title: "UK government calls out Ratcliffe’s “colonisation” claim as offensive"
summary: "The UK government responded to Manchester United co‑owner Jim Ratcliffe’s claim that Britain is being “colonised” by immigrants. Downing Street said the remark was offensive and factually wrong, calling it hypocritical because Ratcliffe lives in Monaco to avoid taxes. Justice Minister Jake Richards said the language was “offensive” and that Ratcliffe should not apologise. The move signals a sharper stance on immigration rhetoric."
