title: "Liberal Democrats Urge Pause on UK Border Rules That Could Block Dual Citizens"
summary: "Liberal Democrats have urged the Home Office to pause the rollout of new UK border rules that could deny dual nationals entry. The new policy would force holders of a British passport, even if expired, or a costly certificate to travel, leaving many families stranded and flights canceled. Young parents, overseas citizens and their relatives have faced sudden travel disruptions, with some considering cutting trips short. The government says passports are needed but faces criticism for the rushed change."
