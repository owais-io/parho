summary: "The article is from Sean Ingle, who grew up watching his great‑uncle Brendan train future champion Naseem Hamed. He watched the new movie *Giant*, where James Bond’s Pierce Brosnan plays Ingle, and found it odd and a bit spooky. The film shows how Ingle guided Hamed from age seven, then their friendship broke down when Hamed’s ego grew. Even after Ingle’s death, the two families later met again, smoothing old wounds."
