title: "Australia to Tighten Hate‑Speech Laws, Says Home Affairs Minister"
summary: "After the Bondi beach shooting, Australia is fast‑tracking new hate‑speech rules. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the laws will push constitutional limits to catch de‑humanising language from hate preachers. The bill will lower the bar for hate speech, but it’s unclear if slogans like “globalise the intifada” will be banned. Lawmakers also want the rules to cover other minorities, including LGBTQ+ people, to stop all forms of hate."
