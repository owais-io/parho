title: "Police used banned power to clamp down on pro‑Palestine protests, experts say"
summary: "The Metropolitan Police have used a power that a court struck down in May 2025 to ban and change the routes of pro‑Palestine protests. Legal experts say there is no law that lets them look at the “cumulative disruption” of a protest, yet the Met and Home Office claim it is still allowed. The ban on a Jewish pro‑Palestine group and changes to a march in November have sparked accusations of unlawful policing and a call for greater accountability."
