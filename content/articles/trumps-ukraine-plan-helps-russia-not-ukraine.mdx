title: "Trump’s Ukraine Plan Helps Russia, Not Ukraine"
summary: "Trump’s new 28‑point plan for Ukraine actually helps Russia. It gives Putin land, cuts Ukraine’s army size, and offers amnesty for Russian war crimes. The plan was made by U.S. and Russian officials, not Ukraine. It promises security but no real help, and could lift sanctions that hurt Russia’s war effort. Ukraine’s leader says the plan is a “vision,” not a real offer, and warns it hurts Ukraine’s democracy."
