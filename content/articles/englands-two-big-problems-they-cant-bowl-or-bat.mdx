title: "England’s Two Big Problems: They Can’t Bowl or Bat"
summary: "England’s Ashes team in Adelaide is struggling. Their bowlers are weak, and the batsmen lack the flair and stamina needed. Players like Harry Brook and Ben Stokes were solid, but others, especially opener Ollie Pope, couldn’t handle the pressure and were dismissed quickly. The article says England’s style—known as Bazball—has lost its spark. Without better bowling and more confident batting, the team is doomed to lose."
