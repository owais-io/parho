title: "UK's biggest new data centre hides real water use"
summary: "A big new data center in Cambois, Northumberland, says it uses no water for cooling. But a study shows its electricity needs would actually use about 124 million litres a year – more than 50 times the company’s claim. When all 10 halls open, the hidden water use could reach 621 million litres, like 11,000 people’s yearly consumption. The site also plans many diesel generators that could pollute the air."
