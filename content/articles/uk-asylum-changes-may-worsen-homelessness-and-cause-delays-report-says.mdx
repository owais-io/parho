title: "UK asylum changes may worsen homelessness and cause delays, report says"
summary: "The National Audit Office says the new asylum plan could backfire, making more people homeless and piling up cases. It found the government doesn’t have enough data on who is in the system or why cases stall, and over half of people who applied almost three years ago still have no decision. The report urges better data, a clear strategy and faster, fairer decisions before more people suffer."
