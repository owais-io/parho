title: "Europe’s push for green energy in Chile could hurt wildlife and the environment"
summary: "Europe is investing billions in Chile’s Patagonia to build giant green‑hydrogen and green‑ammonia plants. The projects would cover thousands of square kilometres with wind turbines, desalination plants and huge factories. While the Chilean government says they will create thousands of jobs, scientists and local groups warn that the salty waste, noise and huge turbines could poison wildlife, harm sea‑life, and damage the fragile Patagonian ecosystem. Most of the fuel will be shipped overseas."
