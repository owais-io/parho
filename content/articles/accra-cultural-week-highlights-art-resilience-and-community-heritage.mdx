title: "Accra Cultural Week Highlights Art, Resilience, and Community Heritage"
summary: "I wrote this farewell while exploring Accra Cultural Week, seeing how art celebrates resilience. In Jamestown, artist Serge Attukwei Clottey turned yellow jerrycans into bright mosaics that honor a fishing community that once welcomed freed slaves from Brazil. The show, made from recycled stuff, reminds us of waste and life cycles. Other exhibits, like Reginald Sylvester II’s minimalist pieces and the Yaa Asantewaa Art prize, showcase Ghana’s rich culture and women artists. The festival shows a vibrant, growing art scene."
