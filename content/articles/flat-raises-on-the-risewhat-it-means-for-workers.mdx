title: "Flat Raises on the Rise—What It Means for Workers"
summary: "A new Payscale report says that by 2026, more than 40 % of companies will give “peanut butter” raises—flat, across‑the‑board increases. Most firms plan a 3.5 % bump, which roughly matches inflation. Critics argue this practice is lazy, hurts high performers, and reflects the widespread dissatisfaction with performance reviews. Workers want fair, merit‑based pay and regular feedback, not a one‑size‑fits‑all raise."
