title: "UK cuts 40% of aid to fight Russian influence in western Balkans"
summary: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has cut 40% of the money the UK gives to the western Balkans to counter Russian influence and cyber‑attacks. Funding for the Integrated Security Fund went from £40m last year to £24m next year. The cuts are part of a move to reduce aid overall.
