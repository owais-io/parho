title: "Labour's New Bill Lets 16‑ and 17‑year‑olds Vote in the Next General Election"
summary: "Labour has pushed a bill that would let 16‑ and 17‑year‑olds vote at the next general election. Conservatives and some right‑wing groups say it’s political manipulation, pointing to past rules that kept young people from registering. Polls show most teens aren’t firmly tied to any party, and the vote’s impact on seats would be tiny. Still, the change signals Labour’s focus on young voters and a shift in the age of political participation."
