title: "Progressives Rush to Buy the Yellow T‑Shirt From Brazil’s Hit Film"
summary: "A yellow T‑shirt that appears in the Oscar‑nominated movie “The Secret Agent” has become a hot item among Brazil’s left‑wing crowd. The shirt was made by a carnival group in Olinda, and after the film’s release and the actor’s award win, orders are flooding in—over 10,000 sold in a month versus just a few thousand last year. The sales help fund the group’s carnival shows and give the shirt a political edge, with President Lula wearing one and far‑right fans of former president Bolsonaro shying away."
