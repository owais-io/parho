title: "Milton Keynes planners say England’s new towns plan falls short"
summary: "Senior planners from Milton Keynes warn England’s new towns plan is too small and lacks enough social housing. They say the new towns won’t help people who need homes the most and that the sites chosen are often just extensions of existing towns. Critics call for stronger government support, clearer planning powers, and more public involvement. Some locals, like in Adlington, oppose huge new housing projects. The government says it will meet its 40% affordable housing goal."
