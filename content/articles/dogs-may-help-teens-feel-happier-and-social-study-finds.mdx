title: "Dogs may help teens feel happier and social, study finds"
summary: "Scientists say that having a dog can make teenagers feel better and more social. In a study of 343 teens, 96 who owned dogs had fewer social and behavioral problems by age 14. Researchers found different bacteria in their saliva and showed that mice given those bacteria behaved more kindly. The microbes may help explain the benefits, but it isn’t clear if the dogs themselves are the cause. A healthy microbiome can still help."
