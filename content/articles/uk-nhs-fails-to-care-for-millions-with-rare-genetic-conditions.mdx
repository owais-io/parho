title: "UK NHS fails to care for millions with rare genetic conditions"
summary: "Millions of UK residents suffer rare genetic illnesses, but a new report says the NHS often ignores them. A survey of 290 people found that a quarter waited three years or more to be diagnosed, and only one in ten had a care coordinator. Just 5 % of rare conditions have approved treatments. Doctors often lack knowledge, especially when patients move from child to adult care. The report calls for a national registry and more research."
