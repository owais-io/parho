title: "England Faces Record Number of Grassland and Forest Fires in 2025"
summary: "England’s 2025 spring and summer were the hottest and driest ever, sparking a record 27,000 grassland, woodland and crop fires. Fire crews fought more than four times the number of spring fires than in 2024 and tackled 14,000 in summer, a top figure since 2022. The effort stretched equipment, money and staff, with some incidents lasting days. Fire services urged better prevention—discarding cigarettes and leaving fires unattended can cause many of these blazes."
