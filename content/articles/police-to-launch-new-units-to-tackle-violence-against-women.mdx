title: "Police to launch new units to tackle violence against women"
summary: "By 2029 every police force in England and Wales will have a dedicated rape and sexual‑offence team. The government will also introduce domestic‑abuse protection orders that judges can use to ban abusers from places, put them on electronic tags or set exclusion zones, with jail terms up to five years for breaches. A £2 m fund will create covert online squads to hunt internet abusers, and training will focus on myths that hurt victims, but the plan has faced criticism for delays and no extra money."
