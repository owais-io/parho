title: "Plastic Production Keeps Rising, Making Recycling Efforts Hard"
summary: "Plastic production has doubled in the last two decades, driven by oil companies shifting to petrochemicals. Big mergers have created huge plastic producers, turning plastic into an energy‑driven industry rather than just waste. Recycling targets can’t stop the rapid growth of virgin plastic. The piece argues we need to curb new production, not just shift to paper or recycling, because both raise carbon footprints and harm forests."
