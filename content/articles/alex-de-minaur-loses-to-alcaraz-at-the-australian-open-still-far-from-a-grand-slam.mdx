title: "Alex de Minaur loses to Alcaraz at the Australian Open, still far from a Grand Slam"
summary: "De Minaur was beaten in the quarter‑finals by Carlos Alcaraz 7‑5, 6‑2, 6‑1, showing he can push top players but still falls short. He has never won a set against Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner and lacks the power of the world’s best. While he beats many top‑10 opponents, the top two stay out of reach. Australian men’s tennis remains in a slump, and de Minaur hopes to improve his game for a future chance."
