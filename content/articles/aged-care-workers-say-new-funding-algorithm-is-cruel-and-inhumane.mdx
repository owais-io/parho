title: "Aged Care Workers Say New Funding Algorithm is Cruel and Inhumane"
summary: "Aged care workers in Australia are warning that a new government‑run tool called the Integrated Assessment Tool (IAT) is making it hard to get proper home support. The computer‑based system takes over human judgement, often mis‑classifying patients' needs. Doctors say it gives too high or too low priority, forces them to “game” the data, and leaves vulnerable seniors without needed help. Politicians say it’s not transparent."
