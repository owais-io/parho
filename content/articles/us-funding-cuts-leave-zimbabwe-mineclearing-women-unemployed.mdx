title: "US Funding Cuts Leave Zimbabwe Mine‑Clearing Women Unemployed"
summary: "Hellen Tibu, a 22‑year‑old mine‑clearing worker, lost her job when the US stopped paying for demining work in Zimbabwe. She can no longer pay her rent, her sisters’ school fees or feed her family. The cut hit the whole sector: many women who worked for Apopo and Halo Trust were let go, and their households are now struggling to survive. Tibu sells second‑hand clothes to make ends meet."
