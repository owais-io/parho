title: "BBC Wants to Dismiss Trump’s $10 Billion Defamation Suit Over Edited Clip"
summary: "The BBC is trying to get a U.S. court to throw out Donald Trump’s $10 billion defamation suit over an edited clip from its Panorama show. The broadcaster says Florida courts have no jurisdiction and that Trump failed to show actual malice. Trump claims the clip made him look like he urged a Capitol riot. BBC says the episode never aired in the U.S. and apologised for the error. The case could go to trial in 2027 if it continues."
