title: "Trump officials say second strike was aimed at sinking drug boat, not crew"
summary: "Trump administration officials say the second missile strike on a drug boat in September was meant to sink the vessel, not kill the crew. They cite a Pentagon legal memo that says the U.S. can target unflagged drug boats because cartels use drug money to buy weapons. The memo also says people on board are not a protected target. The claim comes as lawmakers ask for more investigation."
