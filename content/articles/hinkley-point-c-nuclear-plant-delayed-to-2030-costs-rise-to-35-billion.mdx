title: "Hinkley Point C Nuclear Plant Delayed to 2030, Costs Rise to £35 billion"
summary: "Britain’s new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant will start in 2030, a year late, and its cost rose to £35 billion—almost double the 2016 estimate of £18 billion. French operator EDF says the delay and higher price are “more realistic.” The plant will supply about 7 % of UK electricity, but households will pay more for that power. The project stays key to Britain’s plan to cut fossil‑fuel use."
