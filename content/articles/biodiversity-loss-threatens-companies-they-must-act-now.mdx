title: "Biodiversity Loss Threatens Companies – They Must Act Now"
summary: "A new IPBES report says losing nature is the biggest danger to the global economy. Governments spend trillions each year subsidising activities that damage ecosystems, while only a few hundred billion help protect them. Most companies see it as cheaper to destroy wildlife than to save it, and less than 1 % talk about biodiversity in their reports. Business groups urge quick action, but say governments must lead the change."
