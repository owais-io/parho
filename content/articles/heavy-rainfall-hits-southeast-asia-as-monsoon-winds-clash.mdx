title: "Heavy Rainfall Hits Southeast Asia as Monsoon Winds Clash"
summary: "January storms in Southeast Asia bring over 250 mm of rain in just two days in places like Singapore. The weather is caused by the monsoon, a seasonal wind pattern that brings warm, moist air from the ocean. When north‑south winds meet in the intertropical convergence zone, the air rises, forms huge storm clouds, and dumps heavy rain. These monsoon rains are essential for crops but can also trigger dangerous flooding."
