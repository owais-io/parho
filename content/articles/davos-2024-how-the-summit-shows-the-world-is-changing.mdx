title: "Davos 2024: How the Summit Shows the World Is Changing"
summary: "At Davos 2024, the World Economic Forum felt more like a political showdown than a business conference. Former U.S. President Donald Trump stole the spotlight with his own “board of peace” and speeches that many saw as divisive. The summit highlighted a fading rules‑based global order, with leaders like Zelenskyy and Macron urging new alliances. While tech and AI panels ran, most conversations were about power shifts and the future of international cooperation."
