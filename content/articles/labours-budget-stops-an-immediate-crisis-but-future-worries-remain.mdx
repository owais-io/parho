title: "Labour’s budget stops an immediate crisis, but future worries remain"
summary: "Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves showed MPs a new budget that keeps the party together for now. It cuts some costs – energy bills, rail fares – raises the minimum wage, and ends the two‑child limit. But taxes will rise, especially for the wealthiest, and many MPs still worry about how it will affect voters and the economy. Markets calmed after a brief spike, and the budget stopped an immediate leadership fight, but future elections could still test the plan."
