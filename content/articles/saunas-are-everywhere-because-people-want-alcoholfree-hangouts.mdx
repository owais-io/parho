summary: "I've noticed saunas have popped up everywhere, and it's not just for health. After the pandemic, people started looking for places to hang out without alcohol. Now, friends meet in saunas for a relaxed, alcohol‑free vibe—think zero‑alcohol drinks or coffee instead of wine. The heat makes you feel calm, but it's not about losing weight or building muscle. It's simply a new, sober way to socialize and unwind."
