title: "Reddit Challenges Australia’s 16‑Year‑Old Social Media Ban"
summary: "Reddit has filed a high‑court case against Australia’s new rule that stops people under 16 from using social‑media sites. The company says the law forces confusing checks on everyone, hurts adults, and keeps teens from joining age‑appropriate chats. Reddit argues it’s about free political talk and that it mainly serves adults. While most users are grown‑ups, the court may hear the case next year. Law experts think the ban might survive."
