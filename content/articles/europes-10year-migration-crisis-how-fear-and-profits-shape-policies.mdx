title: "Europe’s 10‑Year Migration Crisis: How Fear and Profits Shape Policies"
summary: "For a decade, Europe has framed migration as a crisis, driving a boom in border‑security spending and a rise in far‑right politics. The EU’s new 2026 migration pact will make emergency powers easier to use, potentially normalising a “permanent crisis.” In Germany, the AfD and right‑wing leaders have amplified anti‑immigrant rhetoric, while the UK government introduced harsh asylum cuts. The article argues that such policies erode democracy and calls for resistance, rescue efforts, and solidarity to counter authoritarian trends."
