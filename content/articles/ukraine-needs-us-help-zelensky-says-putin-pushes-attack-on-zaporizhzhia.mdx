title: "Ukraine needs U.S. help, Zelensky says; Putin pushes attack on Zaporizhzhia"
summary: "Zelenskyy said Ukraine can’t beat Russia without U.S. help and called Moscow’s claim of a drone strike on Putin’s house a lie. He met Trump in Florida and urged continued U.S. support. Meanwhile, Putin ordered troops to advance toward Zaporizhzhia, a city Russia now controls most of. Russia says it has the battlefield edge. The IAEA finished power‑line repairs near the Zaporizhzhia plant, and a theatre in Mariupol reopened after the war."
