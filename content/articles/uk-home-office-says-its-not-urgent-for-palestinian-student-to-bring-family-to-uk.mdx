title: "UK Home Office says it’s not urgent for Palestinian student to bring family to UK"
summary: "A Palestinian academic, Bassem Abudagga, who is studying a PhD in England, asked the UK Home Office to let his wife and two children join him. The Home Office said the case was not urgent and that his kids should stay with their mother in a Gaza tent because no visa‑application centre is available there. Abudagga’s family is living in hard conditions after the home was destroyed. He now has a lawyer to challenge the decision."
