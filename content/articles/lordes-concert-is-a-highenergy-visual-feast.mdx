title: "Lorde’s Concert Is a High‑Energy, Visual Feast"
summary: "Lorde’s latest tour lights up a 21,000‑seat arena with bright lasers, quirky stage props, and rapid‑fire camera shots. She moves from rocking a treadmill to performing barefoot in baggy jeans, turning each song into a kinetic spectacle. The show mixes drum machines, analog synths, and eye‑catching graphics that pop like pixelated screensavers. Fans get a mix of powerful pop hits, personal confessions, and a dance‑filled, intimate experience that feels both nostalgic and fresh."
