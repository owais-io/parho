title: "Hillsborough law stalls, hurting Labour leader Keir Starmer"
summary: "A new law that would force police, NHS and other public bodies to give full, honest information in investigations has hit a snag. Labour added a clause forcing MI5 and MI6 to cooperate, then withdrew it after backlash from MPs and families of the 97 victims of the 1989 stadium disaster. The setback could damage Starmer’s credibility and delay the law’s passage."
