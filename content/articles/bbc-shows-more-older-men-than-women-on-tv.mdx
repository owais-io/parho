title: "BBC Shows More Older Men Than Women on TV"
summary: "An independent review of the BBC found that older men are far more common on TV than older women. While there are almost twice as many men over 50, and nearly four times as many men over 60, women often have to look younger or adopt a quirky persona. The study says there's no systemic discrimination, but highlights ageism and sexism. BBC officials plan to improve representation of older women and other under‑represented groups."
