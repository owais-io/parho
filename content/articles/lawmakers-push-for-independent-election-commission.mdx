title: "Lawmakers Push for Independent Election Commission"
summary: "MPs and peers are urging the Prime Minister to restore the Electoral Commission’s independence after it was placed under ministerial control. They plan to amend next year’s elections bill, which will also allow 16‑year‑olds to vote and tighten donation rules. Lawmakers argue an independent watchdog builds public trust and guards against corruption. Most voters back the move, while the government insists the Commission remains operationally independent."
