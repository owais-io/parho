title: "Google’s AI Summaries Give Dangerous Mental Health Advice"
summary: "A UK mental health charity, Mind, is investigating how Google's new AI summaries, shown to 2 billion people each month, can give wrong or harmful mental‑health advice. In tests, the AI told people that starvation is healthy, blamed mental‑health problems on brain chemistry, and claimed many patients fake their conditions. These short, confident snippets cut out nuance and can mislead or hurt users, especially those in crisis. Mind wants Google to provide accurate, balanced information instead of quick, risky answers."
