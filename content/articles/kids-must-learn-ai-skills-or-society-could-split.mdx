title: "Kids Must Learn AI Skills or Society Could Split"
summary: "In a Cambridge school, 10‑year‑old Joseph taught his AI to spot apples and smiles, showing kids can grasp AI basics. Experts warn that if children don’t learn how AI works, a big gap will form between those who can influence decisions made by automated systems and those who can’t. They argue AI literacy should be taught everywhere, like reading and maths, because AI is already shaping jobs, health and justice."
