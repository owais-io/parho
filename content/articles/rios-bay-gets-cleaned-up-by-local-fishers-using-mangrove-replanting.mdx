title: "Rio’s Bay Gets Cleaned Up by Local Fishers Using Mangrove Replanting"
summary: "Rio de Janeiro’s Guanabara Bay is one of Brazil’s most polluted waters, but in the protected Guapi‑Mirim area local fishers have turned the tide. They plant mangrove trees, pick up trash, and restore habitat, bringing back birds, crabs and fish. NGOs and Petrobras fund the work, and the mangroves now protect the community from storms. The project shows how community action can clean and revive a polluted bay."
