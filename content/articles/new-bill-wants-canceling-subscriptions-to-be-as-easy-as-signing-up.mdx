title: "New bill wants canceling subscriptions to be as easy as signing up"
summary: "Mark Takano, a Democrat, and Mark Amodei, a Republican, are bringing back a bill that would stop companies from making it hard to cancel subscriptions. The law would require firms to get clear permission before charging after a free trial and make the cancel process no harder than signing up. The bill comes after the FTC’s click‑to‑cancel rule was overturned in court. Consumer groups back it, while big industry groups oppose it."
