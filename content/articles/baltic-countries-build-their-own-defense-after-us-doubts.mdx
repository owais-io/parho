title: "Baltic Countries Build Their Own Defense After US Doubts"
summary: "When the US started to doubt whether it would defend Europe, small countries around the Baltic Sea stepped up. Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and others set up a shared sea‑watching centre, created a patrol called Baltic Sentry, and launched AI tools to spot threats to undersea cables and pipelines. They also started inspecting suspicious ships that may be hiding Russian weapons. These local moves show how Europe can keep its security even if the US pulls back."
