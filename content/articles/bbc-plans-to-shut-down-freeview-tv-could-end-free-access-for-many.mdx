title: "BBC Plans to Shut Down Freeview TV Could End Free Access for Many"
summary: "In 2034, the BBC wants to turn off Freeview, forcing everyone to pay for broadband just to watch BBC programs. That would cost over £500 a year, cutting off the poorest and oldest who rely on free TV. Critics argue it would break the BBC’s promise of a universal, free service. Keeping Freeview would keep the BBC accessible and cost only a small slice of its income."
