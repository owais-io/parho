title: "Student loans keep working‑class graduates in debt for life"
summary: "When the UK tried to make university cheaper in 1998, it introduced low‑interest loans that were meant to be paid off quickly once you earned enough. But for students from poorer families, the debt sticks around until age 65. Interest has more than doubled the original amount, and there’s no cut‑off like newer loans. The Guardian letters argue for zero‑interest loans to level the playing field and ease the long‑term burden."
