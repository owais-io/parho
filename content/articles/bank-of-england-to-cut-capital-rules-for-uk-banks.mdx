title: "Bank of England to Cut Capital Rules for UK Banks"
summary: "The Bank of England is reducing the amount of extra money banks must keep on hand by about one percentage point, from roughly 14% to 13%. This change is aimed at freeing up funds for loans to homes and businesses. The move follows recent stress tests showing the country’s biggest banks can weather a serious downturn. While regulators and the chancellor see it as a boost for growth, critics worry it weakens safety nets against bank failures."
