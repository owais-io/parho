title: "California Gov. Newsom Refutes Claim That 33,000 Undocumented Criminals Will Be Released"
summary: "California Governor Gavin Newsom said the Trump administration’s claim that the state will release 33,000 undocumented criminals from its jails is false. The claim came after a DHS statement that ICE had asked the state to honor detainers for that many people. Newsom explained that California only hands over convicted non‑citizens who have finished their sentences, and the actual number in state custody is far lower. The governor’s office said the president’s remarks were a distraction."
