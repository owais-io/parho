title: "Labour’s Workers’ Rights Bill Costs Businesses About £1 billion"
summary: "Labour's workers' rights bill has been trimmed to cut business costs to about £1 billion, the government says. The original plan could have cost up to £5 billion, but ministers will roll out changes over several years and changed a key rule: workers can only claim unfair dismissal after six months instead of from day one. Some unions say the bill is weaker, but the government says the extra costs are small and the benefits for workers outweigh them."
