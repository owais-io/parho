title: "Facebook Will Charge Users to Post Links, Which Could Hurt News Sites"
summary: "Facebook is testing a rule that only lets users who don’t pay for a Meta Verified account post two free links per month. If you need more, you’ll have to buy a subscription that starts at £9.99. The test targets personal profiles and Professional Mode pages, but not news outlets right now. Still, the move could make it harder for journalists to share stories, especially after Facebook cut news traffic last year."
