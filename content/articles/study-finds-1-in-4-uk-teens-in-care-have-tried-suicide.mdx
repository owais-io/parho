title: "Study Finds 1 in 4 UK Teens in Care Have Tried Suicide"
summary: "Researchers looked at a large UK study of 19,000 people born in 2000‑2002 and found that 26% of 17‑year‑olds who had lived in foster or residential care had tried to kill themselves. That's almost four times the 7% rate for teens who never went into care. The same group also had higher rates of self‑harm, depression, early sex and pregnancy. Experts say this shows a national emergency and that more mental‑health help is urgently needed for care‑experienced youth."
