title: "Will the BBC keep the licence fee or switch to a new funding plan?"
summary: "The BBC could keep the current licence fee, but the government is also looking at other ways to pay for the broadcaster. Options include funding from taxes, a subscription plan, advertising, extra charges for premium shows, a household levy or small tweaks to the licence fee. Most experts think the licence fee will stay, with only minor changes, because it lets the BBC serve everyone. The other ideas face political and practical hurdles."
