title: "Court Blocks VAT on Private School Fees, Puts Parents in Tough Spot"
summary: "An appeals court said the government can keep adding a 20% VAT to fees at independent Christian schools. Families and school leaders argued the tax would make small schools unviable and remove a right to faith‑based education. Judges said there’s no law protecting a specific kind of schooling and that parents could instead home‑school. The schools already charge far lower fees than most private schools, so the extra tax could push them into closure."
