title: "Manchester Museum Seeks Public Help to Tell the Stories of Its African Collection"
summary: "Manchester Museum has an Africa Hub where it invites people to help fill gaps in the history of its 40,000 African objects. Many items have no maker or cultural background recorded because they were traded or taken during the British Empire. The museum is showing pieces and asking visitors and online users to share names, origins and stories. Working with the local Igbo community, curators hope this collaboration could lead to better records, returns and stronger ties with African diaspora."
