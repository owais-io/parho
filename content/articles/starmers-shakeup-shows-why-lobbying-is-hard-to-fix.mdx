title: "Starmer’s shake‑up shows why lobbying is hard to fix"
summary: "Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, fired a top civil servant after a scandal involving Peter Mandelson, who used to be a UK ambassador and now runs a lobbying firm. The emails showed how lobbyists can give inside political teams private advice and gifts. Despite promises to tighten rules, the system still lets lobbyists keep close ties with government. A big example is Palantir, a tech company that won more than £500 million in NHS and Defence contracts. Because politicians value the briefings that lobbyists give, they keep hiring them, even though it can undermine public trust. The scandal has hurt Starmer’s popularity and left many wondering if real change will happen."
