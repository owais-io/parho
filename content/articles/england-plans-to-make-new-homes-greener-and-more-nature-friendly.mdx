summary: "The UK government has released new guidelines that want every new housing development in England to include green spaces, local shops, schools, and preserved heritage sites. Examples like King’s Cross, Bath, Manchester and Newcastle are highlighted as models. The rules are advisory, not compulsory, so developers could ignore them. Experts say nature‑friendly features, such as wildlife corridors and sustainable building tech, must become mandatory to protect the environment and help communities."
