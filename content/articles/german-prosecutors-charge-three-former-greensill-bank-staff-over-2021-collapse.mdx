title: "German prosecutors charge three former Greensill Bank staff over 2021 collapse"
summary: "German prosecutors have charged three former Greensill Bank managers and board members for their role in the bank’s 2021 collapse. They are accused of hiding the real risk of a €2.2 bn loan to the Gupta family’s steel business, which caused the bank to fail. The charges say the officials misled the bank’s records to make the loan look safe. The case follows a long legal mess from Greensill’s fall, but the Gupta group itself is not part of this German case."
