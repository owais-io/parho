summary: "A cartoon in Charlie Hebdo that painted journalist Rokhaya Diallo in a racist, exoticizing image caused a huge backlash. Diallo called it a racist throwback to colonial stereotypes, and millions shared her criticism online. The magazine fired back, accusing her of distortion and calling her a foreign “sweetheart.” The debate highlighted how black women face both racism and sexism, and how the paper’s response undermined its own anti‑racist claims."
