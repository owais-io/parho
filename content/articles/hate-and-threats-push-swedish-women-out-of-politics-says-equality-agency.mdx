title: "Hate and threats push Swedish women out of politics, says equality agency"
summary: "In Sweden, more women in politics are being threatened, harassed and scared to speak out. The government’s equality agency says this is hurting democracy. About a quarter of female politicians report threats, higher than men, and many feel unsafe, especially younger women. The result is that women step down or stay silent, which weakens debate and policy. Sweden is calling on the government and social media to stop the abuse."
