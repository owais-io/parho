title: "Students Are Reforming How Economics Is Taught"
summary: "After the 2008 crash, students in the US and UK began protesting economics classes that stuck to narrow, maths‑heavy theories. In 2013 they launched Rethinking Economics at LSE, a student group that now has members in over 40 countries. The movement pushes for courses that cover history, politics, inequality and real‑world problems, and has helped redesign programmes in universities across Europe, South Africa and beyond."
