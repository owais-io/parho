summary: "Cairn follows Aava, a top climber, as she tackles the never‑climbed Mount Kami. Players guide her hands and feet on rock, juggle limited pitons, hunt water, and manage injuries, all while feeling the real tension of a free‑solo climb. The game mixes survival mechanics with a deep emotional story, pushing you to question Aava’s obsession. It’s tough, realistic, and ultimately moving, ending in a tear‑jerking moment that left the reviewer on the sofa."
