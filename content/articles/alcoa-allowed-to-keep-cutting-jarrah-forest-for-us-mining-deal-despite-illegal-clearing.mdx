title: "Alcoa Allowed to Keep Cutting Jarrah Forest for US Mining Deal, Despite Illegal Clearing"
summary: "Australia’s government has let Alcoa keep cutting the western Australian jarrah forest, even though the company has been clearing illegally for 15 years. The decision was tied to a 2023 US‑Australia minerals deal that sells gallium for defence and clean‑energy use. A $55m penalty was applied to only six years of illegal work, sparking outrage from conservationists who say the move favors corporate and foreign interests over the forest’s endangered species."
