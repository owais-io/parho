title: "Super Bowl 2023: A Quiet Game Without Trump or Politics"
summary: "The 2023 Super Bowl was a low‑key event in Santa Clara. President Trump didn’t appear, and the planned fighter‑jet fly‑over was cancelled. The game itself was a defensive battle with little drama, and there were no big protests during the half‑time show, which featured Bad Bunny. Broadcasters focused on the play rather than politics, aiming for a normal, calm experience. Viewers also noticed that the national anthem was performed quietly by Charlie Puth."
