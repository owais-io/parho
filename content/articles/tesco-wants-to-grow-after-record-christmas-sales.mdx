title: "Tesco wants to grow after record Christmas sales"
summary: "Tesco’s shares fell after the company said its third‑quarter sales were a bit weaker than expected, even though it just hit its best market share in a decade over Christmas. Tesco holds 29% of the UK market and beat rivals like Asda, but sales in the UK, Ireland, Europe and its wholesale arm were below forecasts. CEO Ken Murphy said Tesco is comfortable, aims for about £3.1 bn profit this year, and will keep prices low to win more shoppers by 2026."
