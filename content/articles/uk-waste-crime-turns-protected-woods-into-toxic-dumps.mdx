title: "UK waste crime turns protected woods into toxic dumps"
summary: "In Kent, criminals dumped 35,000 tonnes of rubbish in a protected woodland, forcing a £15 m cleanup that started last summer. Residents and NGOs pushed the Environment Agency to act, but many other illegal dumps across the country still exist, with hazardous waste threatening rivers and wildlife. The agency lacks money and staff to clean up all sites, and the police say the problem is a growing crime network. People are calling for stronger action."
