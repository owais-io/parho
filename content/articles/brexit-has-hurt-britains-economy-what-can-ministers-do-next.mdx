title: "Brexit has hurt Britain’s economy – what can ministers do next?"
summary: "Brexit has taken a toll on Britain’s economy, especially in trade and growth. Trade with the EU fell sharply after the transition period, and businesses face extra rules and costs. Ministers are looking at options like a customs union or better‑trade agreements to ease barriers. A customs union could give a modest GDP boost, but it would mean tighter ties to Brussels and less trade freedom. The talks will take years."
