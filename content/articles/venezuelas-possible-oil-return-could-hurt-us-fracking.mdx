title: "Venezuela’s Possible Oil Return Could Hurt US Fracking"
summary: "US shale producers are already dealing with very low oil prices. News that Venezuela might restart its oil production worries them because it could add more supply to a market already overloaded. Prices are around $56 a barrel, while new wells need $61‑70 to break even. Small fracking companies could cut output and face losses if Venezuela’s oil floods the market. The industry is already tightening budgets and may see production dip in 2026."
