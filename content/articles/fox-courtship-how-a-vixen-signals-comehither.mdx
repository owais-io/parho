title: "Fox Courtship: How a Vixen Signals “Come‑Hither”"
summary: "While walking along a coastal path, the writer spotted a female fox and a large male dog‑fox watching her. The vixen performed a playful “come‑hither” smile, lowering her front legs and raising her tail. She then nudged the male, who quickly mounted her. They locked in a brief, involuntary mating tie that boosts the chance of a successful pregnancy. The whole exchange shows how foxes court and bond before a short fertile period."
