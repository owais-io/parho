title: "Ramadan’s Iftar Brings People Together"
summary: "In Ramadan, people stop eating alone and wait to break their fast together at sunset. This shared pause lets everyone eat at the same time, no matter where they live. It reminds us that eating isn’t just about food—it’s a social moment that brings strangers and friends close. The ritual shows how a simple, daily act can strengthen community and empathy, even in our busy, tech‑driven lives."
