title: "Quiet After the Storm"
summary: "A strong east wind rattled a house, knocked over plants, then settled by dawn, leaving a calm, clear morning. The storm left fallen branches in the lane and a trail of frost still covers the grass. Birds like jays, jackdaws, rooks, and a blackbird moved through the trees and pasture, adding life to the quiet, and the writer hopes spring will bring warmer days."
