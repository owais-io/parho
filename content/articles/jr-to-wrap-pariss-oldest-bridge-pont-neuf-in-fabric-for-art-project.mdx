title: "JR to Wrap Paris’s Oldest Bridge Pont Neuf in Fabric for Art Project"
summary: "French artist JR will cover the historic Pont Neuf bridge in Paris with fabric in June, a nod to the 1985 work by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. The 232‑metre long bridge will be wrapped for three weeks, creating a “cave” effect while still open for traffic. The project, called Pont Neuf Cavern, involves many engineers and workers, and is funded privately. It marks the 40‑year anniversary of the original wrap and celebrates public art."
