title: "41,000 People Crossed the Channel by Small Boat in 2025"
summary: "In 2025, 41,472 people crossed the English Channel in small boats, the second‑largest yearly total ever. The Home Office called the figure “shameful” and said the new “one‑in, one‑out” deal with France and tougher law‑enforcement powers will stop the flow. Labour’s immigration reforms aim to cut incentives, while critics like Nigel Farage call the plan a disaster. Human‑rights groups say there’s no proof that small‑boat arrivals commit more crime, and refugee advocates warn the policy punishes desperate people seeking safety."
