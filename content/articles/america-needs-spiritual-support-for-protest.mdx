title: "America Needs Spiritual Support for Protest"
summary: "Across the U.S., activists say the fight against injustice needs more than tactics; it needs a spiritual backbone. They point to Gaza, U.S. imperialism, and ICE as clear examples of evil. Nashashibi explains that while the Four‑D strategy tackles fear, power, defection, and rebuilding, the Four‑R plan adds spiritual depth—disruption, resonance, delegitimization, reigniting, reclaiming, and radical re‑imagination. Together they aim to renew moral courage and build a better future."
