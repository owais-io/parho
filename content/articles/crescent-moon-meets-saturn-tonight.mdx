title: "Crescent Moon Meets Saturn Tonight"
summary: "A thin crescent moon will glide past Saturn tonight, creating a lovely sky show. From London it can be seen around 6 p.m. GMT, and it’s visible from wherever the sun is setting. The moon is just under four days old and only 15 % bright, so you might catch the faint glow of Earthshine on its dark side. Saturn looks steady and bright, and you’ll also see new stars appear as the night deepens."
