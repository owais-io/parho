title: "Coal lobby heavily backs ads attacking Labor and Greens"
summary: "A grassroots group called Australians for Prosperity spent about $415,000 on online ads that targeted Labor, the Greens and independent candidates in the last federal election. Its funding came almost entirely from Coal Australia – about 94% of its $3.9 million receipts. The group is linked to the Liberal Party and has former Liberal MP Jason Falinski as a spokesperson. Critics say the ads spread misinformation and show how a coal lobby tries to shape elections."
