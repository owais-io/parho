title: "Can Parliament Fix Poverty in England’s Coastal Towns?"
summary: "MP Polly Billington of Ramsgate says England’s seaside towns are stuck in a cycle of poverty – poor transport, few jobs and low education opportunities. She and other coastal MPs want a cabinet‑level coastal minister to bring more money and plans to these places. The aim is to give young people clear training paths, better buses, and to recognise the creative strengths of these towns. If Parliament listens, the coast could finally get the support it needs."
