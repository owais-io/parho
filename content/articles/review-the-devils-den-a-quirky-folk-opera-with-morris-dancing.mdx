title: "Review: The Devil's Den – A Quirky Folk Opera with Morris Dancing"
summary: "Opera North’s first full‑length production of Isabella Gellis’s hour‑long opera, The Devil’s Den, blends folk horror, Morris dancing, and quirky characters like a talking rabbit and a fire‑breathing toad. Set on a Wiltshire dolmen, the story follows a child judged “bad” by a druid and the devil. The performance mixes traditional music with inventive instrumentation and a lively cast, though some scenes feel a bit long. Overall it’s a strange, entertaining mix of folklore and modern theatre."
