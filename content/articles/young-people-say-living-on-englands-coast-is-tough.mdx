title: "Young people say living on England's coast is tough"
summary: "Young people in England’s seaside towns say life there is hard. On the Isle of Wight most houses are taken by retirees, leaving few jobs and no clubs for 18‑to‑35‑year‑olds. In Berwick‑upon‑Tweed, friends leave because of no jobs but love the community, so they hope to stay if new gigs appear. In Great Yarmouth, a conservative vibe makes it hard for LGBTQ+ teens to feel at home. Ilfracombe and Eastbourne have low‑pay, seasonal work and high housing costs, so many go away to university or other cities."
