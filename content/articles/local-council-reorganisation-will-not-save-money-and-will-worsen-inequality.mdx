title: "Local Council Reorganisation Will Not Save Money and Will Worsen Inequality"
summary: "A Guardian letter argues that cutting local councils into big “super councils” won’t cut costs. The writer says the changes would make services less responsive, especially in poorer towns that already have fewer resources. Rich suburban councils can raise more money for local amenities, while the cuts will hurt libraries, playgrounds and youth clubs in disadvantaged areas. The letter warns that the plan will mainly benefit the government’s growth agenda, not residents."
