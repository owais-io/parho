title: "Humanities programs cut at U.S. universities, sparking protests"
summary: "At Montclair State University, students staged a mock funeral to protest the school’s plan to merge 15 humanities and social science departments into four new schools. Their action mirrors a national trend of universities cutting or consolidating programs, especially in the humanities, to trim budgets and follow market‑driven goals. Critics say the moves erase essential critical‑thinking skills, while administrators claim they’re boosting efficiency. The fight shows how higher‑education budgets and politics are reshaping what students study."
