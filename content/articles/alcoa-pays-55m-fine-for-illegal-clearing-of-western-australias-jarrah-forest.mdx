summary: "The Australian environment minister fined the U.S. mining giant Alcoa $55 million for illegally clearing over 2,000 hectares of jarrah forest near Perth, a habitat for endangered cockatoos. Alcoa must fund large conservation projects, but the minister also gave the company an 18‑month exemption to keep cutting for bauxite while the government reviews a 2045 expansion. Environmental groups warn the move sets a dangerous precedent, while the mining sector stresses job security and mineral supply."
