title: "Antarctic Ozone Hole Shrinks to Its Smallest Size Since 2019, Scientists Report"
summary: "The hole in the Antarctic’s protective ozone layer was its smallest and ended early this year, scientists say, a sign the layer is healing. It covered 21 million square kilometres—below the 26‑million peak last year—and shut down sooner than expected. The drop comes after the 2022 volcano blast that enlarged the hole in 2023. Thanks to the Montreal Protocol, the layer should reach 1980 levels by 2066."
