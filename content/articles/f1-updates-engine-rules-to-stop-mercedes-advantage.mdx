title: "F1 Updates Engine Rules to Stop Mercedes Advantage"
summary: "The FIA and car makers have agreed to change the rules about engine compression ratios, which some say gave Mercedes an unfair boost. The new rule will lock the compression ratio in all temperatures from 1 June 2026, and only in operating conditions from 2027. The change comes before the season starts in Australia, and it should level the playing field for all teams. Meanwhile, F1 is keeping an eye on travel safety in the Middle East."
