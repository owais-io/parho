title: "Ursid Meteor Shower Follows Geminids – Watch It Tonight"
summary: "The Ursids meteor shower is next, after the Geminids. They produce up to 10 meteors per hour, less than Geminids, but still worth seeing. The meteors come from comet 8P/Tuttle. The peak occurs on the night of Dec 22‑23. Their light comes from Ursa Minor, the little bear, which is circumpolar in the UK, so you can see it right after sunset. Bring warm clothes, a chair and a blanket for a relaxed night, but it won’t be visible from the Southern Hemisphere."
