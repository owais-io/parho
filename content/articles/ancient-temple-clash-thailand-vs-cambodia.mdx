title: "Ancient Temple Clash: Thailand vs. Cambodia"
summary: "Thailand and Cambodia have fought over the same border for over a hundred years. Colonial treaties in 1904‑1907 moved the line north, giving Cambodia more land and putting a famous 11th‑century temple, Preah Vihear, near the edge of both countries. A 1907 French map put the temple inside Cambodia, while Thailand says the border follows a natural ridge. The UN court said the temple is Cambodian, but the surrounding area remains disputed, keeping tensions alive."
