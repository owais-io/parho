title: "Labour Adds More Members to the House of Lords, Escalating the Battle"
summary: "Sir Keir Starmer has appointed 96 new life peers, more than any recent Conservative prime minister. While Labour campaigned on reforming the House of Lords, it has done little except push a bill that will remove hereditary peers. The Lords now number around 850, larger than before, and the government wants more Labour peers to outvote the 282 Conservatives. Critics say this only fuels anger and argue the chamber should be capped at the size of the Commons."
