title: "Kraków’s Clean‑Air Policy Saved Nearly 6,000 Lives"
summary: "Since 2013, Kraków banned burning coal and wood for home heating, cutting soot (black carbon) levels dramatically. Health experts say the move saved about 6,000 early deaths in ten years and cut asthma and allergic rhinitis in children by 17% and 28% respectively. The city subsidised clean heating, introduced a low‑emission zone, and its success sparked similar bans across Poland."
