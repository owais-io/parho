title: "Iran’s Internet Shut Down, But a Few Still Connect via Smuggled Starlink"
summary: "Iran cut almost all internet after protests, but some people still get online. They use smuggled Starlink satellites, tiny terminals that bring outside internet to homes. The government hunts for these devices and may jail users. Only a few hundred thousand out of 90 million can use them. Iran is also building its own closed internet with local apps and a national streaming service. This new network would replace the global web. Whether the old internet will return remains uncertain."
