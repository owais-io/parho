title: "Trump Is Trying to Erase Jan. 6 from History"
summary: "Five years after the Jan. 6 attack, Trump and Republicans are trying to erase the event. They gave pardons to about 1,500 people, paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit over a rioter’s death, and fired DOJ staff who worked on Jan. 6 cases. They also blocked a plaque honoring police. Trump’s political comeback followed his 2020 impeachment acquittal, and the Supreme Court said the attack didn’t disqualify him. Ongoing investigations keep the story alive."
