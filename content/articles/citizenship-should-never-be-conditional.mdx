title: "Citizenship should never be conditional"
summary: "The letter argues that citizenship must be a guaranteed right, not something that can be taken away. While the Home Office says it won’t strip Alaa Abd el‑Fattah’s status over past tweets, new laws could let others lose citizenship. Labour’s 2025 policy assumes anyone who entered illegally can’t be naturalised, and a deprivation order stays in force during appeals. This makes citizenship a privilege for some and a right for others, deepening inequality."
