summary: "According to a new report, U.S. journalists have been hit with far more assaults this year than in the last three combined, especially while covering protests about Trump’s immigration rules. The Freedom of the Press Foundation says the attacks are linked to the president’s hostile comments toward the media and the police’s heavy‑handed tactics. Several reporters are suing police and ICE, and a federal judge has stopped the authorities from striking journalists without proof of a crime."
