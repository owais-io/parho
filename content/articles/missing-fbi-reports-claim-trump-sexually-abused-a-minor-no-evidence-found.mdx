summary: "Three FBI interview reports that were not released with the bulk of Jeffrey Epstein files say a woman said President Donald Trump sexually abused her when she was a minor in the early 1980s. The claims are not backed by evidence, and the FBI never charged Trump. The missing reports sparked a congressional investigation after journalists and NPR discovered them.
