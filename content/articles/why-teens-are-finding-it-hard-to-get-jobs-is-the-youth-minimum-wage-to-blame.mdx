title: "Why teens are finding it hard to get jobs – is the youth minimum wage to blame?"
summary: "Teenagers in the UK are finding it harder to get jobs. Unemployment for 18‑24‑year‑olds is at its highest since 2015. A new rule raises the minimum wage for under‑20s to £10 an hour, while employers already feel it costs too much to hire young staff. Some politicians say the wage hike might push teens out of work, but others argue it should be part of a wider review of youth poverty. The debate shows how complex the problem is."
