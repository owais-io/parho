title: "UK shoppers avoid high streets on Boxing Day"
summary: "On Boxing Day, UK shoppers stayed away from high streets. Foot traffic fell a little overall – just 0.3% less – and in central London it dropped 7.7%. Retail parks were an exception, seeing a 6.9% rise as people prefer the easy parking and car access. Warmer days in the south and online deals made many buy from home instead. Even though the average shopper will spend a bit more, fewer people are turning out because of cost worries."
