title: "Australia’s Winter Olympians Set New Goals After Successful Milano Cortina Games"
summary: "Australia finished 14th in the 2026 Winter Olympics, earning three golds, two silvers and a bronze, a best‑ever result. Teen freestyle skier Indra Brown finished fifth, just 5.5 points from a medal and landed a first‑ever 1080‑spin in competition, setting a record for an Australian under 18. The success was helped by new training centres in Brisbane and Jindabyne that let athletes practise year‑round. Yet many athletes say funding is still tight and more support is needed."
