title: "Ocado’s Canadian partner shuts its automated warehouse"
summary: "Ocado said its Canadian partner, Sobeys, will close a robotic warehouse in Calgary. The move was driven by the slow growth of Alberta’s online grocery market and a smaller than expected customer base. Shares fell nearly 10% after the news. Ocado will still supply technology to Sobeys’ other delivery centers in Toronto and Montreal, and expects £18 million in compensation. The closure is part of a broader shift in Ocado’s North‑American strategy."
