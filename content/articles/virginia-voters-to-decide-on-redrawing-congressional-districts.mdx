title: "Virginia Voters to Decide on Redrawing Congressional Districts"
summary: "Virginia lawmakers have moved a plan that could let Democrats redraw the state’s congressional maps, potentially adding up to four Democratic‑leaning seats. The plan sends a constitutional amendment to voters in April, skipping the bipartisan panel that usually sets the lines. With Democrats controlling the legislature and governor’s office, the vote could give them a big boost in the mid‑term election cycle, as other states are also reshaping districts to favor one party."
