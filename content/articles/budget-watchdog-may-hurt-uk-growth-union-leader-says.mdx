title: "Budget watchdog may hurt UK growth, union leader says"
summary: "The Trades Union Congress says the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the body that checks the government’s spending plans, is stuck in an “austerity” mindset that could choke economic growth. The OBR’s new productivity forecast could cost the UK up to £20bn, forcing the chancellor to raise taxes or cut services. The TUC wants the OBR’s role reviewed, maybe publishing one forecast a year instead of two."
