title: "Garang Kuol: From 2022 World Cup hope to playing in Europe"
summary: "Garang Kuol was a wonder in Australia’s 2022 World Cup, and he soon moved to Europe. He signed with Newcastle United but found it hard to break into the first team, so he went on loans to Hearts in Scotland and FC Volendam in the Netherlands. Injuries and limited playing time have slowed his progress, but he has kept his drive and intelligence. Today he plays for Sparta Prague, hoping to turn his promise into a European career."
