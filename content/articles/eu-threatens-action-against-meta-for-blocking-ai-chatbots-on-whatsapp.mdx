title: "EU threatens action against Meta for blocking AI chatbots on WhatsApp"
summary: "EU warns Meta could face penalties for blocking other AI services on WhatsApp Business. The European Commission says the change to the app last year lets only Meta’s own AI chat assistant run on the platform, hurting competition. Brussels wants to enforce antitrust rules and could take action if Meta doesn’t open its API to rivals. Meta says other AI options exist. This move adds to tensions between EU regulators and US tech firms."
