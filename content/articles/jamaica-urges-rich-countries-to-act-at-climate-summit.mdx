summary: "At COP30 in Brazil, Jamaica led a group of vulnerable countries to ask rich nations to cut emissions and give more money to fight climate damage. Jamaica’s minister blamed Hurricane Melissa, which cost about $10 billion, on the changing climate. Leaders from Cuba, Mauritius, and Brazil echoed that climate change is a survival issue. While some topics like food security were agreed, key points on finance, trade and keeping warming below 1.5 °C still have no progress."
