title: "Cricket Match Rebuilds Fire‑Damaged Community"
summary: "Australia’s 2024 bushfires have turned small towns like Sarsfield and Clifton Creek into rebuilding projects. A volunteer fire‑brigade idea turned into the Sandhill Ashes cricket match, bringing people together after the 2019‑20 fires. The game drew locals, club players and national cricket icons for a fun, charity‑style match that lifted spirits and helped reconnect the towns. Today, the two clubs play on new ovals, and the community watches for the next fire."
