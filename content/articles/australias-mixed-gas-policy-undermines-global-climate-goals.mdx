title: "Australia’s Mixed Gas Policy Undermines Global Climate Goals"
summary: "Australia is set to lead next year’s climate talks, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s confusing stance on gas is a problem. While the IEA says new oil and gas projects aren’t needed and that gas use should drop fast, the PM keeps saying Australia’s gas will help power renewables. He also supports new gas fields that could lock in extra emissions. This back‑and‑forth weakens Australia’s push for a global fossil‑fuel phase‑out and threatens things like coral reefs that need 1.5 °C cooling."
