title: "Are Self‑Driving Taxis Safe for London?"
summary: "London is set to welcome driverless taxis from Waymo by the end of 2026. The idea sounds great – no drunk or distracted drivers, cheaper fares – but real‑world tests in the U.S. have caused traffic jams, minor accidents, and even a cat’s death. London’s streets are narrower, people jay‑walk, and the city is already cutting car use. Citizens and policymakers worry about safety, fairness, and how the tech will fit into the city’s transport plan."
