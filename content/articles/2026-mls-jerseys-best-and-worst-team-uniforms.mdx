summary: "With MLS’s 2026 season coming, teams have unveiled new jerseys that mix pop culture, history, and bold design. San Jose’s tie‑dye “Dead” kit nods to the Grateful Dead, while Houston’s skyline photo and Philadelphia’s 1776 flag‑filled shirt try to capture local pride—though some look clunky. LAFC keeps it sleek with holographic logos, and St. Louis honors Tina Turner with a shiny gold print. A few, like DC United, miss the mark."
