title: "Stop Feeding Pigeons to Control Their Numbers"
summary: "The letter argues that pigeons thrive because people feed them. Experiments in London and New Zealand show that things like nets, hawks, or giving eggs don’t cut numbers – the birds just keep coming if food is available. The real solution is to stop people from feeding them and, where it works, to set up controlled feeding points or by‑laws. Some writers suggest dovecotes or remembering war pigeons, but the writer says humane control means tackling human behaviour."
