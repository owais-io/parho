title: "Australia's Big Inheritance Wave Threatens Equality"
summary: "Australia is set to hand over about $5.4 trillion in inherited wealth over the next two decades, mainly from boomers to their children. This huge transfer will make home ownership easier for some, but will also widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Older generations hold most of the property, so younger Australians who rent may miss out. The growing inequality could erode trust in the system and threaten social mobility and democracy."
