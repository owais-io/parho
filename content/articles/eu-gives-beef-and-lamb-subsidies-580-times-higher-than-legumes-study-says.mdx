title: "EU gives beef and lamb subsidies 580 times higher than legumes, study says"
summary: "A new report shows EU farmers get far more money for beef and lamb than for plant foods. In 2020, subsidies for cattle and sheep were 580 times higher than for legumes, while pork got 240 times more. Dairy also received 554 times the support of nuts and seeds. The Common Agricultural Policy gives most money based on farm size, not on health or climate. Experts say this needs to change to encourage plant‑based diets."
