title: "School PE Cuts May Drive Up Obesity Costs"
summary: "A plan to slash the money the UK government gives to physical education in schools could make the obesity problem worse. New NHS data shows two‑thirds of adults in England are now overweight or obese, with a third actually obese. The health survey says the disease costs the NHS £6.5 billion a year, but the real cost to society – lost jobs, extra welfare payments – is far higher. Prevention, like encouraging kids to play, is cheaper than treatment."
