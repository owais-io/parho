title: "Wales Approves England’s Assisted‑Dying Law"
summary: "The Welsh parliament voted 28‑23 to let the NHS provide assisted dying under England’s law. Members debated constitutional worries because criminal law isn’t devolved in Wales. The vote was free, so parties could decide individually. If passed, the law will go through the House of Lords next, after which Wales can choose to keep the service in the public system and stop relying on private providers."
