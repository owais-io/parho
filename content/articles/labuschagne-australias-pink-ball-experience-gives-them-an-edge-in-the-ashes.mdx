title: "Labuschagne: Australia's pink ball experience gives them an edge in the Ashes"
summary: "Labuschagne says Australia’s experience with day‑night Tests gives them an advantage in the Ashes because they play the pink ball all the time at home. He explained that the pink ball behaves differently from the red one and that Australian bowlers, especially Mitchell Starc, have learned how to use it. His own batting average is higher in pink‑ball matches, showing they’ve adapted. He also said that the order of batting still matters."
