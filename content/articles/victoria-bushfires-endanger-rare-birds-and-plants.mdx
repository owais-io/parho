title: "Victoria Bushfires Endanger Rare Birds and Plants"
summary: "The February–March bushfires in Victoria scorched more than 435,000 hectares, destroying homes for endangered species like the eastern bristlebird, dingoes, and rare plants such as the southern shepherd’s purse. Rescue teams couldn't reach many hotspots because the fires were still active, so scientists can’t yet count survivors. The damage could push some species closer to extinction, and experts say better fire‑control, rapid response and climate action are urgently needed."
