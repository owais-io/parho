title: "Declan Rice: From Chelsea Reject to Arsenal’s Star Midfielder"
summary: "Declan Rice was let go by Chelsea when he was 14 and later given blunt, honest coaching at West Ham. That “clean feedback” helped him grow into a top midfielder. He joined Arsenal for £105 m, where he’s become a key playmaker and set‑piece expert. Coaches call him a “lighthouse” on the pitch, and some say he could win a Ballon d’Or if he keeps winning trophies."
