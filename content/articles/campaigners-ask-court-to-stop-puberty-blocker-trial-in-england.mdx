title: "Campaigners Ask Court to Stop Puberty Blocker Trial in England"
summary: "A group of parents, a psychotherapist and a former teen who used puberty blockers have begun a legal case to halt an NHS‑funded study that will give these drugs to children with gender dysphoria. They worry the treatment could permanently damage fertility and that the research lacks enough safety evidence. The trial, run by King’s College London, plans to test the drugs on 226 youngsters aged 10‑15 over three years. NHS officials say the study has full approvals and will add much-needed evidence."
