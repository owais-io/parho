title: "New rules will cut mental‑health support for NSW workers"
summary: "In New South Wales, a deal between the Labor and Coalition parties will change the workers’ compensation system in 2026. The new rules raise the threshold for a permanent psychological injury from 15 % to 25 % (later 28 %). Workers with less impairment will get only a limited period of benefits and must join a return‑to‑work program. The aim is to keep insurance premiums steady and help businesses, but unions say it hurts injured workers."
