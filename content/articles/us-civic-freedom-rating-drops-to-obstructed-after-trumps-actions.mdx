title: "US civic freedom rating drops to “obstructed” after Trump’s actions"
summary: "Civicus, the group that watches civic freedom, cut the US rating from “narrowed” to “obstructed” after a year of Trump‑led actions. The downgrade points to tighter rules, police crackdowns on protests, ICE raids, limits on college groups that speak out, and attacks on media. It says the government is spying on NGOs, harassing them and using force against peaceful protesters. The US joins 39 other countries now marked “obstructed.”"
