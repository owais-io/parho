title: "Labour’s biggest hurdle: Lords slow government’s plans"
summary: "Labour’s win in the Commons hasn’t helped get laws passed. In the House of Lords, former Tory MPs and cross‑bench peers use tactics that slow debates and force extra votes, causing the government to lose over 100 bills this session. A key fight is the plan to remove all hereditary peers, sparking protests and money‑spending to keep them out of the vote. Labour has added new peers to balance numbers, but the Lords still push back hard."
