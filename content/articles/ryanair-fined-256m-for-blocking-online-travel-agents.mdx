title: "Ryanair fined €256m for blocking online travel agents"
summary: "Italy’s competition watchdog fined Ryanair €256m for blocking online travel agencies. The airline built technical hurdles that forced customers to buy tickets only through Ryanair’s own site. Chief Michael O’Leary says it was fighting ‘pirate’ agents that add extra fees. Ryanair will appeal the ruling. The fine covers actions from April 2023 to at least April 2025. The move could hurt competition and slow sales for third‑party sites."
