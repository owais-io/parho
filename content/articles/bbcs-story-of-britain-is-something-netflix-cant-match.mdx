title: "BBC’s Story of Britain Is Something Netflix Can’t Match"
summary: "Tony Hall, the former BBC chief, says the BBC is more than a TV channel – it’s a national institution that tells Britain’s story. He argues that Netflix can’t match the BBC’s local news, drama, and cultural shows that keep people informed, entertained, and united. Hall warns that President Trump’s $5 bn claim should not distract from the real debate about how the BBC should be funded and run. The BBC also helps the UK’s economy and global reputation."
