title: "Gallup Ends 88‑Year Presidential Approval Poll"
summary: "Gallup announced it will no longer track presidential approval ratings, ending an 88‑year tradition. The change is part of a shift toward longer‑term, issue‑focused research. Trump has often criticized polls that show him low approval and has threatened lawsuits. While the popular presidential poll will disappear, Gallup will keep other surveys like its World Poll and Quarterly Business Review. This move reflects Gallup’s focus on long‑term studies of issues that shape people’s lives."
