title: "Syria’s former IS camps: women and children start returning home"
summary: "Humanitarian groups warned that the camps in north‑east Syria holding thousands of family members of suspected IS fighters were a “ticking time bomb.” Since 2019, about 8,000 women and children from more than 40 countries have been stuck in camps like al‑Hawl and al‑Roj. Recent weeks have seen a few women smuggle themselves to Turkey and back to their home countries, while governments scramble to organize safe, coordinated repatriation. The process remains chaotic, raising fears of new radicalisation or exploitation."
