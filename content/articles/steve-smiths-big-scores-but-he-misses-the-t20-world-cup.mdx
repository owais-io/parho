title: "Steve Smith’s big scores, but he misses the T20 World Cup"
summary: "Steve Smith has been scoring heavily for the Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash, with a recent 65 from 43 balls taking his team to the final. His impressive form comes after a long absence from Australia’s T20 squad, and it is too late to earn a spot for the 2026 World Cup. Instead, Smith is eyeing new opportunities in U.S., England and European T20 leagues and wants to stay fit for future events."
