title: "England’s Social Housing Is Letting the Poor Fail"
summary: "England’s social homes were made for the poorest people, but a new report says the system is now cutting them off. Housing associations use strict income checks that leave many with rent arrears out of the queue. Low benefits and a shift to profit‑driven landlords mean people can’t afford even modest rents, so homelessness rises. Scotland still gives priority to homeless households. The article calls for a big rebuild of social homes and better welfare support."
