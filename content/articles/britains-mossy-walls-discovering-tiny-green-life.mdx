title: "Britain’s Mossy Walls: Discovering Tiny Green Life"
summary: "Bryophytes, tiny plants like moss and liverwort, have lived on Earth for almost half a billion years. In Britain, they’re surprisingly common—nearly 300 species of liverwort and 770 of moss, about a twentieth of the world’s total. They thrive in damp places, covering tree trunks, woodland floors, and even limestone walls. In Derbyshire’s Priestcliffe parish, a single wall can host dozens of moss species, each tiny but wildly varied, creating a living, green serpent across the stone."
