title: "Trump Plans to Redesign Washington: White Walls, New Arch, and Selling Old Buildings"
summary: "Trump wants to paint the Eisenhower Executive Office Building white, fix the Lincoln Memorial pool, and build a new Arc de Triomphe in Washington. He’s also looking to sell off 45 federal buildings, many with historic murals and art. Critics say this move erases government history and serves Trump’s ego. The GSA has already pulled back its list of properties, and Trump has fired officials who advise on design."
