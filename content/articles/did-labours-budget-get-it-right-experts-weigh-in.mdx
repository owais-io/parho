title: "Did Labour’s Budget Get It Right? Experts Weigh In"
summary: "Labour's new budget, led by Rachel Reeves, cuts the child benefit cap and gives extra money to low‑paid workers, but critics say it still leaves the rich untouched. The plan freezes prescriptions, rail fares and green levies, and adds a small tax on homes over £2 m. Supporters praise the help for families and children, while opponents argue the tax changes are too weak and ignore young workers' needs."
