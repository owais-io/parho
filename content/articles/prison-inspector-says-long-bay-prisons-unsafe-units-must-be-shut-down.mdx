title: "Prison inspector says Long Bay prison’s unsafe units must be shut down"
summary: "A New South Wales prison inspector says two sections of Long Bay Correctional Centre are unsafe and must be closed permanently. The units, built in 1909 and used for vulnerable inmates, are dilapidated, have ligature points and can’t meet safety or humane standards. Staff have also failed to follow proper procedures for transgender prisoners. While some upgrades have been made, the inspector found little progress since 2015 and urges the government to shut these sections for good."
