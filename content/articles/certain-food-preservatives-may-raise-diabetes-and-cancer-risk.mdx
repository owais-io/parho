title: "Certain Food Preservatives May Raise Diabetes and Cancer Risk"
summary: "Two French studies of over 100,000 people found that eating more food preservatives can raise the chance of getting type‑2 diabetes and some cancers. The research looked at 17 additives over 14 years and saw higher risks for cancers of the breast, prostate and overall, and a 40‑50% rise in diabetes risk with certain preservatives. The authors say companies should cut back on unnecessary additives and that people should choose fresh, less‑processed foods."
