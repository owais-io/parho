title: "Australia replaces 13 call‑centre workers with contractors, union warns"
summary: "The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) is ending short‑term contracts for 13 call‑centre staff and will hire a private firm to fill the jobs. A union says this could affect people who rely on government help, as the new workers will have to start over. The move goes against a promise to stop outsourcing core work, and the union fears the private staff may lack the experience to handle calls from vulnerable people."
