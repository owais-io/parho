title: "9,000+ Gaza Children Treated for Severe Malnutrition in October, UN Reports"
summary: "Even after a ceasefire, Gaza still faces a nutrition crisis. In October, more than 9,000 kids were hospitalized for severe malnutrition, the UN said. The shortages stem from Israeli restrictions on aid and a lack of food for a population that has lived in shelters for two years. Though aid trucks have increased, only about 140 arrive a day, far below the 600‑truck target. The situation also risks low‑birthweight babies for months."
