title: "Wood‑burning stoves could triple children’s indoor air pollution"
summary: "A new study in Wales measured air pollution on 53 primary‑school children wearing sensor backpacks. It found that homes with wood‑burning stoves had three times higher particle pollution than homes without, especially during winter. Urban kids were cleaner than rural ones because more rural homes used wood burners. The findings warn about asthma and cancer risks and showed parents could change habits after seeing the data."
