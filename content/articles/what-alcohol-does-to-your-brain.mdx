title: "What Alcohol Does to Your Brain"
summary: "Alcohol moves into the brain in minutes and changes how chemicals talk to each other. It boosts the calming GABA, slows down thinking and memory, and at high levels can make you blackout, lose balance, and even choke. Women, light‑weight people or those drinking fast feel it more. Genetics can make some people enjoy alcohol more and risk addiction. Even adults should be careful—there’s no truly safe amount, especially for teens."
