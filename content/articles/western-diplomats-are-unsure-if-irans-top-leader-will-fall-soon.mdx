title: "Western diplomats are unsure if Iran’s top leader will fall soon"
summary: "Western diplomats are reluctant to say whether Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei might soon be toppled. They remember how 1979’s fall of the Shah was missed by many officials. Today, protests in Iran are huge, but experts see no mass defections inside the regime. The government’s leaders, including the IRGC and the Supreme Council, stay united, so any change in power would be hard to predict. The situation remains uncertain."
