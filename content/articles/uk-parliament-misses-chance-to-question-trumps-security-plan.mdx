title: "UK Parliament Misses Chance to Question Trump’s Security Plan"
summary: "Before Christmas, Labour MP Matt Western asked urgent questions about President Trump’s new national security strategy. But many MPs, including Nigel Farage, Kemi Badenoch and even senior ministers, were absent or spoke poorly. The article ridicules how Parliament let Trump’s plan—promising to destabilise European democracies—go unchallenged. It lampoons the lack of accountability and the sleepy attitude of UK politicians. Readers see a warning that politicians can ignore urgent threats."
