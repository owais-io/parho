title: "Union Elections Drop 30% in 2025 as Trump Weakens Labor Board"
summary: "Union elections fell by 30% in 2025, and the number of workers voting dropped 42%, the Center for American Progress says. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) lost many staff and a balanced board when Trump fired a member and then filled the seats with Republicans. This shift made the board less friendly to unions. Despite higher public support for unions, the board’s weakened power and fewer staff mean fewer elections and lower success rates."
