title: "BBC World Service Must Be Funded, No Matter What"
summary: "The Guardian letter argues the BBC World Service is a key global news outlet that has been cut by the government’s budget cuts. The writer says the service should be funded from the licence fee or defence budget, not left to the BBC to pay. Former journalists and listeners describe how the World Service gave news in Spain, helped soldiers in the Cold War, and kept people in Guyana connected. It’s a vital voice of freedom that must be protected."
