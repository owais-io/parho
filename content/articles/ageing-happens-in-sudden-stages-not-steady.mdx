title: "Ageing Happens in Sudden Stages, Not Steady"
summary: "New studies show that ageing isn’t a slow, steady slide but a series of sudden shifts. Brain scans split people’s brains into five stages, with big changes at ages 9, 32, 66 and 83, and a long “teen‑to‑early‑adult” period that stretches to 32. Other organs jump around ages 44, 50 and 60. The message? Ageing is patchy, so we could target health checks better and focus on wellbeing, not just longer life."
