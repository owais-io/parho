title: "UK wants to change human rights law to make deportations easier – can it succeed?"
summary: "UK wants to change how the European Convention on Human Rights is read, so it can deport illegal migrants more easily. Keir Starmer said the rules need urgent reform. UK ministers went to a Council of Europe meeting where 27 countries called for changes to Articles 3 and 8, protecting against torture and family life. A follow‑up meeting in May could issue a declaration to guide judges, though it isn’t legally binding. Some want the UK to quit the treaty."
