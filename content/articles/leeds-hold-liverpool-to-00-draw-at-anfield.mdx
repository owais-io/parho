title: "Leeds hold Liverpool to 0‑0 draw at Anfield"
summary: "Leeds managed a 0‑0 draw at Anfield, the first scoreless game for Liverpool under manager Arne Slot in 84 matches. Leeds’ defence kept Liverpool to a low‑key game, and the visitors missed chances even with good possession. Coach Daniel Farke left top scorer Dominic Calvert‑Lewin out, and the striker’s late goal was disallowed for offside. Liverpool’s star keeper Alisson earned his 100th clean sheet, but the match was a quiet one."
