title: "Shoppers still see no change after WH Smith sells stores to TG Jones"
summary: "Six months after WH Smith sold its high‑street shops to Modella Capital, they now trade as TG Jones. For many customers the layout and product mix look the same, and some can’t spot the new name. Modella plans to refit stores and add services like post‑offices and hobby sections, but only a few shops have been updated and 24 have already closed. With cheaper rivals and rising costs, shoppers are moving online or to discount stores."
