title: "Teenagers Turning to AI Chatbots for Mental‑Health Support"
summary: "A recent study shows about one in four teens (and 40 % of those in violent situations) turn to AI chatbots for help with mental‑health problems, instead of waiting for a clinic. With NHS wait lists around 400 days, chatbots are 24/7, easy to access, and feel private. But there are worries about privacy, lack of human judgment, and legal gaps, plus rising lawsuits over bot‑related suicides."
