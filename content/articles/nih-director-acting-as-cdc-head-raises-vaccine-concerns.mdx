summary: "NIH chief Jay Bhattacharya has been named the acting director of the CDC, the U.S. public health agency, a move that has raised alarms. Experts say he is closely linked to vaccine critic Robert Kennedy Jr. and may push tighter rules on shots. Staff worry he will be too hands‑off and that the dual job could hurt daily operations. The appointment also means he could keep changing vaccine schedules, which many scientists fear will undermine trust."
