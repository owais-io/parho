title: "Killing dingoes after backpacker’s death could threaten island’s dingo population"
summary: "After a Canadian backpacker died on K’gari, Queensland officials killed part of a 10‑dog dingo pack. Experts say taking out ten animals from a population of only 70‑200 is risky and could push the island’s dingoes toward extinction. The move angered traditional owners and the victim’s family, who said the animals shouldn’t be harmed. Scientists argue culling won’t solve human‑dingo clashes and could worsen genetic problems."
