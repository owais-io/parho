title: "Why my baby’s pockets made me mad"
summary: "I was shocked when I saw my baby's pants had way more pockets than mine. It made me think about how women's clothes have long been missing real pockets, and how new mums need practical pockets for diapers, wipes, and other things. The author jokes she’d put her AirPods in the baby's pockets and calls on designers to add more pockets to maternity wear."
