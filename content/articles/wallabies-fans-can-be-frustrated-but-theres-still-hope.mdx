title: "Wallabies fans can be frustrated, but there’s still hope"
summary: "Australia’s rugby team has been exhausted by a packed European tour, leading to careless mistakes and shaky finishes. Still, there were bright moments – a great try from Max Jorgensen and signs that new players could turn things around. The squad needs a solid playmaker and a reliable centre, but the core of the team is improving. With a World Cup home in 2027, the Wallabies aren’t finished yet – they just need a break and more consistency."
