title: "Inflation dips, but RBA unlikely to cut rates"
summary: "Australia’s latest inflation report shows a smaller rise than expected – 3.4% year‑on‑year, down from 3.8% in October. The data, released monthly, are less influential than quarterly figures, so the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) probably won’t cut rates next month. The drop is mainly because electricity prices and rents were hit by rebates in some cities, especially Brisbane, which saw a 5.1% rise. Black‑Friday sales didn't distort the numbers. The RBA is likely to keep rates steady until the February CPI."
