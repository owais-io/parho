title: "Spain’s Prime Minister Calls Out Trump and US Actions"
summary: "Spain’s PM Pedro Sánchez, who usually avoids naming Trump, has taken a bold stand against the U.S. for its moves in Venezuela, Greenland, and other conflicts. He called the Venezuelan intervention a dangerous precedent and defended the idea that countries should follow fair rules, not aggression. While Spain’s critics worry the U.S. might retaliate, no concrete punishment has come yet. The PM’s outspoken words echo strong Spanish public support for Ukraine, Gaza, and a critical view of Trump."
