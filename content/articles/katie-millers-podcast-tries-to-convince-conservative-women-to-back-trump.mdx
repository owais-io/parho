title: "Katie Miller’s Podcast Tries to Convince Conservative Women to Back Trump"
summary: "Katie Miller, wife of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, runs a podcast that features conservative politicians and their wives. She asks light, family‑focused questions instead of hard‑hit topics, like how guests honor God or raise kids. The show sells Trump‑style “family values” to women, pushing them to support the administration. Critics say it’s shallow and avoids controversial issues, making it feel more like a promotional spot than a real interview."
