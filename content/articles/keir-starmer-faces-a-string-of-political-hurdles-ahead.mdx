title: "Keir Starmer faces a string of political hurdles ahead"
summary: "Starmer must tackle a string of political hurdles. First, documents about Peter Mandelson’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein could hit his credibility. Then a close Labour byelection in Manchester could see him lose support. A white paper on special educational needs will test his budgeting skills. The spring statement may rattle markets, and the May local, Scottish and Welsh elections could deliver a big blow to his popularity. All could threaten his time in office."
