title: "China slaps 55% tax on Australian beef, angering producers"
summary: "China has imposed a 55% tariff on Australian beef that exceeds its 2026 import quota, part of new “safeguard” rules to protect its domestic cattle sector. The quota is set at 2.7 million tonnes, less than the 2.9 million tonnes Australia imported in 2024. Beef producers are furious, saying the move hurts trade ties and limits access to China. Canberra says it will keep beef competitive worldwide."
