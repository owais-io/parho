title: "BBC World Service Faces Funding Cut – May Shut Down in 7 Weeks"
summary: "The BBC World Service, which reaches 313 million people in 43 languages, will run out of money in just seven weeks. Its £400 million budget is mainly paid by licence fees, and the £137 million that the Foreign Office provided last year will finish in March. Without a new funding plan, the service could close. Meanwhile, state‑run media in Russia and China are expanding, while U.S. news outlets struggle. The World Service is key for emergency coverage in places like Iran, Afghanistan and the Middle East."
