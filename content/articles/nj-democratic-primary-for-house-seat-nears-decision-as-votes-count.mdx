title: "N.J. Democratic Primary for House Seat Nears Decision as Votes Count"
summary: "After former Rep. Mikie Sherrill resigned to become governor, New Jersey’s 11th‑district Democrats held a special primary. Eleven candidates ran, but the race came down to progressive activist Analilia Mejía and former congressman Tom Malinowski. As votes counted, Mejía led by hundreds, a win that could energise Democrats’ progressive wing heading into the mid‑term elections. The contest also drew heavy negative ads from a pro‑Israel super‑PAC. The winner will face a Republican in the April general election."
