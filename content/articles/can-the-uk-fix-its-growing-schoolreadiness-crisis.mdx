title: "Can the UK fix its growing school‑readiness crisis?"
summary: "In the UK, almost 40 % of four‑year‑olds arrive at school without basic skills like toilet training and dressing. Teachers spend over an hour a day on these tasks, leaving less time for learning. The problem is linked to cuts to early‑years services such as Sure Start, parents’ long working hours, rising costs, and high screen use. Experts say clear information for parents, better support and new guidance could help reverse the trend."
