title: "Car‑Sharing Companies Eye London After Zipcar Shuts Down"
summary: "Zipcar is closing its UK business, leaving a big gap in London’s car‑sharing market. Several rivals – Free2Move, Enterprise Car Club, Co Wheels, Hiyacar and Turo – are looking at opening or expanding fleets in the city. London’s mixed parking rules and high fees make it hard, but the city’s large, public‑transport‑heavy population keeps it attractive. Peer‑to‑peer firms can grow faster because they don’t need to buy cars."
