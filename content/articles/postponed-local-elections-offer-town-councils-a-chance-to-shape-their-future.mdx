title: "Postponed Local Elections Offer Town Councils a Chance to Shape Their Future"
summary: "Local elections across England have been pushed back to 2027 because of a new devolution plan. Town and parish councils could lose the chance to vote for their own leaders for years. Some see this as a chance to rethink how local government works, with residents leading the way. In Lewes, council members talk about using the pause to create community‑driven solutions. Critics say canceling elections is undemocratic and worry about unelected officials holding power."
