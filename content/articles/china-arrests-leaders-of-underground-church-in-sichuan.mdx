summary: "Police in Sichuan’s Deyang city arrested Li Yingqiang, the head of the underground Early Rain church, and his wife, along with two other members. This is part of a broader government crackdown on unregistered churches. Many leaders face vague charges like “picking quarrels.” While China says it protects religious freedom, the state only officially recognizes five religions, and it’s tightening control over private gatherings.
