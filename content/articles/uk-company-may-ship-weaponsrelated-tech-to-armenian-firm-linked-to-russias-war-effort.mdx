title: "UK company may ship weapons‑related tech to Armenian firm linked to Russia’s war effort"
summary: "The UK government has given Cygnet Texkimp permission to send a high‑tech machine that makes carbon‑fibre prepreg to an Armenian firm called Rydena. Rydena’s leaders once worked for Russia’s major war‑machine supplier, Umatex, which the West has sanctioned. Experts worry the move could help Russia get parts for its weapons. The UK says it did checks, but critics say more scrutiny is needed."
