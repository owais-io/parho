title: "US Faces Criticism Over Zambia Health Aid Deal"
summary: "US faces criticism for a $1bn health aid deal with Zambia that includes a 10‑year data‑sharing clause and a link to the country's mining sector. Zambia’s health workers and civil‑society groups say the terms are harsher than in other African deals and could endanger HIV treatment. The US wants Zambia to hire 40,000 new staff and invest more, while threatening to pull funding if targets aren’t met. Activists want the data‑sharing removed."
