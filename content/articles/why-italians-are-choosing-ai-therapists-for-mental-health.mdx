summary: "Many people in Italy are using AI chatbots as therapists. The reason? Real therapy is expensive, and talking about mental health can feel embarrassing. The article follows a woman in Rome who learns that her friends all have AI therapists named “Sol.” A survey shows most Italians see mental illness as a weakness and can’t afford care. AI therapy offers free, judgment‑free help, especially in towns where stigma and cost keep people from seeing a human therapist."
