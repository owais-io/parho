title: "Offenders in England and Wales will be monitored for alcohol use during the New Year"
summary: "Starting this New Year, the UK will check the alcohol levels of thousands of offenders who have been fitted with sweat‑monitoring tags. If the tags detect alcohol, a probation officer gets an alert and can send the person back to court or prison. The system has kept 97% of users sober since 2021, cutting drink‑driven crime. Some experts worry about withdrawal risks, but the government plans to tag many more people as part of a crime‑prevention push."
