title: "COP30 Draft Leaves Out Plan to Phase Out Fossil Fuels"
summary: "At COP30, the draft outcome misses any plan to shut down fossil fuels, even though almost 30 countries said they would refuse a deal without it. The Brazilian organizers sent a text that left out the roadmap, drawing criticism from a coalition of nations. Those in favour of a clear phase‑out see the roadmap as a must‑have, while Saudi Arabia, Russia, and others push back. A fire delayed talks, but the debate over fossil‑fuel policy still dominates."
