title: "Is cold weather linked to more flu cases?"
summary: "While winter is when flu is common, being cold itself doesn’t make you sick. Flu viruses spread by droplets and can survive longer in cold, dry air. Cold weather also pushes people indoors, where crowded, poorly ventilated spaces let viruses spread more easily. Less sunlight in winter drops vitamin D, which can weaken immunity. To stay healthy, improve indoor air flow, keep humidity up, and keep vitamin D levels high."
