title: "New South Wales Premier Uses Special Police Powers to Control Protests During Israeli President's Visit"
summary: "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns has given police special powers to keep the city calm while Israeli President Isaac Herzog visits. The move could limit protests, but police say it won’t ban them – just close sites, direct crowds and fine people up to $5,500 if they break orders. 13 state MPs asked the police to allow a march from Town Hall to Parliament, some even joining the rally. Protesters fear the extra powers could shut down demonstrations."
