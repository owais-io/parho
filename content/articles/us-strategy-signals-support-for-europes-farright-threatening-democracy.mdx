summary: "The Trump administration’s new national‑security plan shows it wants to help European far‑right groups like Hungary and Italy, using ideas such as the “Great Replacement” to blame liberal democracies for Europe’s problems. It pushes for tighter free‑speech rules, a closer relationship with Russia, and a view that a democratic Europe will soon be weakened. The document warns Europe that the US now sees itself as an ally of nationalist forces, not just a reluctant partner."
