title: "UK to give pubs £100 million a year in tax support"
summary: "UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce a £100 million‑a‑year package to help pubs hit by higher business rates and cost rises. The move comes after the government realised the tax change would hurt many pubs, causing closures and job cuts. The relief will give cash back to pubs, but does not lower beer VAT or extend to hotels. The plan is part of a broader effort to keep pubs open in the UK."
