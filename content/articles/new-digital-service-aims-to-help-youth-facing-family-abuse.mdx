title: "New Digital Service Aims to Help Youth Facing Family Abuse"
summary: "In Australia, many young people don’t want to call abuse helplines because they’re used to texting and chatting online. Safe Steps, a state support service, is planning a national “support multiverse” that would let kids and teens find help through social media, games, forums and messaging apps. The idea is to design the service with young people and pair it with real‑world, trauma‑informed help, since funding for child‑focused support is scarce."
