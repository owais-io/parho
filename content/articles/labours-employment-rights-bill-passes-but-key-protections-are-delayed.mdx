title: "Labour’s Employment Rights Bill Passes, but Key Protections Are Delayed"
summary: "Labour’s new employment rights bill passed Parliament, but it was trimmed. The powerful clause that would protect workers from unfair dismissal on their first day now starts after six months, a compromise with the Tory majority in the Lords. The bill still tightens zero‑hour contracts, expands parental leave, gives sick pay from day one, and lets unions enter workplaces to recruit. Critics call it a ‘shell’, but supporters say it’s a big step for fairer jobs."
