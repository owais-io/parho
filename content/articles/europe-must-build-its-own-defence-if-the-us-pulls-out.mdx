title: "Europe Must Build Its Own Defence if the US Pulls Out"
summary: "Europe is learning it can’t rely on the US for defence anymore. Leaders say they need a stronger, independent European military, which means higher budgets, new weapons, training, and possibly conscription. Current NATO and EU structures are slow and split, so a new “coalition of the willing” has been suggested to act quickly. This could become the core of a future European defence union, giving Europe faster decision‑making and a real security footing."
