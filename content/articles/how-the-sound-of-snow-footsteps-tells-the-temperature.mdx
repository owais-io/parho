title: "How the Sound of Snow Footsteps Tells the Temperature"
summary: "New research shows that the way snow makes noise when you walk on it can hint at the temperature. When it’s just above –10 °C, your foot melts a thin layer, creating a crunch. Near 0 °C it sounds more like a squelch. As it gets colder, the ice crystals break apart, producing a squeak that gets louder as the snow gets colder and sticks together. Factors such as snow depth, the surface below, and how long the snow has been on the ground also affect the sound. This means experienced walkers might learn to guess the temperature just by listening to the crunch or squeak under their feet."
