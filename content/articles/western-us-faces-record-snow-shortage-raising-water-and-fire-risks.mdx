title: "Western U.S. Faces Record Snow Shortage, Raising Water and Fire Risks"
summary: "A massive snow drought is hitting the western United States, with snow cover at about one‑third of normal for this time of year. The low snowpack means less meltwater for millions who rely on the Colorado River, threatening agriculture and water supplies. Warm winters have left snow only at high elevations, raising the chance of an early, longer wildfire season. Water‑use talks are in a tight race, or the government could step in, risking more uncertainty."
