title: "How Anti‑Woke Liberals Helped Trump Win"
summary: "After a year of Trump’s return, many people still see the world as shifting to the right. But a new idea called “reactionary centrism” shows that some moderates blame the left while ignoring the right’s real actions. They claim only liberals have agency, while the GOP is just reacting. This false balance keeps people thinking Trump’s win was just a backlash, and it weakens democracy."
