summary: "Eleven Australian women, along with their 23 children, are held in a Kurdish‑run camp in north‑east Syria. They say the kids’ mental health is breaking down and they would let the children leave for Australia even if it meant being separated. The Australian government refuses to help the family return, while human‑rights groups warn the children face abuse, trafficking and radicalisation.
