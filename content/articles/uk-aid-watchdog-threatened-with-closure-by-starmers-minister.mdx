title: "UK Aid Watchdog Threatened With Closure by Starmer’s Minister"
summary: "Jenny Chapman, a close aide of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is looking at shutting down the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), the body that checks how the UK spends its £14bn aid budget. MPs from both sides are furious, saying it would hide the damage from big aid cuts and break Labour’s own election promise. Critics argue that, with aid already being trimmed, an independent watchdog is more important than ever."
