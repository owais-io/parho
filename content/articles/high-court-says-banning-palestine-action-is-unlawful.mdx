title: "High Court Says Banning Palestine Action Is Unlawful"
summary: "High Court judges ruled that banning the pro‑Palestine group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act was unlawful. They found the Home Secretary’s decision broke policy and violated freedom of expression and assembly. The court dismissed arguments about procedural fairness and the claim that the group’s aims mattered. Although the court orders the ban quashed, it stays in force until the government appeals. Police say they will not arrest supporters until the case is decided."
