title: "Labour MPs push for a ban on social media for kids under 16"
summary: "More than 60 Labour MPs have written to Prime Minister Keir Starmer asking him to support a ban on social media for people under 16. They want a law that would let tech firms enforce age limits, following Australia’s example. The MPs argue that children are anxious, unhappy and distracted by social media. Starmer says he’s open to a ban but wants more evidence and careful planning before acting. The House of Lords will vote on an amendment this week that could force the government to act."
