title: "Trump Pushes Drilling, Overlooks Climate Crisis"
summary: "Trump’s State‑of‑the‑Union speech skipped the phrase “climate change” but kept the topic in the background as he celebrated a “drill, baby, drill” push. He praised record oil and gas output while rolling back wind, solar and offshore wind projects, costing thousands of clean‑energy jobs. Trump promised to cut electricity prices with new “ratepayer protection” deals for tech firms, but critics say it only favors big data centres and won’t curb climate damage."
