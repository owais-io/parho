title: "Zillow Removes Climate Risk Info From Listings After Sellers Say It Hurts Sales"
summary: "Zillow, the big US real‑estate site, took out a feature that showed how much a home could be affected by climate threats like wildfires and floods. Sellers and agents said the ratings made homes harder to sell, so the company removed the tool. Zillow now points buyers to a partner called First Street for risk info. Climate‑risk experts warn that without the data buyers might find problems after buying, but some say the models are still unreliable."
