title: "Trump’s Military Options Against Iran Are Very Limited"
summary: "Trump’s White House says the president could use force against Iran, but in reality there are very few practical options. No aircraft carriers are in the Middle East, and U.S. air strikes would need to use bases in other countries, risking retaliation. Even a missile attack could hit civilians, and the Iranian regime is tough and already survived Israeli strikes. Cyber attacks have been suggested but may not help the protestors. This limits any U.S. military move."
