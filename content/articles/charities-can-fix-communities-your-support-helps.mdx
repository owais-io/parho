title: "Charities Can Fix Communities – Your Support Helps"
summary: "Charities can fix communities – your support helps. Austerity and lack of investment have hurt many UK towns, making people feel hopeless and turning them toward far‑right politics. The Guardian appeal asks for donations to charities that rebuild trust and bring neighbours together. Projects like Back on the Map in Sunderland, Citizens UK training organisers, and Hope Unlimited’s anti‑hate work are funded. While they can’t replace government, the money raised (over £500k so far) helps mend social bonds."
