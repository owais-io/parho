title: "Small Class Sizes Aren’t the Key to Better Schools"
summary: "I retired head of a small school, I think we shouldn’t see small class size as a cure‑all for education problems. While parents want smaller classes, it drives up costs and the real issue is teacher quality. Good teachers and a positive culture can work well with 30 students. Workload is driven by school culture, not just class size. Small groups can limit friendships, while a class of 30 helps kids find peers."
