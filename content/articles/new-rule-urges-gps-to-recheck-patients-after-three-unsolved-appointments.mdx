title: "New rule urges GPs to re‑check patients after three unsolved appointments"
summary: "In England, a new “Jess’s rule” will be posted in every GP office. If a patient’s symptoms haven’t been diagnosed after three visits, doctors must rethink the case – get a second opinion, do a physical exam or order extra tests. The rule was created after 27‑year‑old Jessica Brady died of cancer that was missed in her routine appointments. The posters aim to catch serious illnesses early and save lives."
