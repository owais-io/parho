title: "Will Europe Boycott the World Cup if Trump Tries to Take Greenland?"
summary: "European football groups are debating a World Cup boycott if U.S. President Donald Trump tries to annex Greenland. The idea surfaced after a meeting of national soccer leaders in Hungary, where officials said they need a united stance. They compare the situation to Russia’s 2022 ban after its war in Ukraine. While some governments say no, others leave it to the federations. Public petitions in the Netherlands back a boycott, but no decision yet."
