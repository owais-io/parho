title: "Bondi Beach Shooting Shows Why We Must Address Antisemitism"
summary: "The Bondi beach shooting was not an isolated event but the result of years of ignoring antisemitism, especially when it comes from the left. Progressive groups and some media have downplayed hate words, saying they’re just criticism or nuance, even when those words would be hateful against other minorities. This let warnings slip and created an environment where violence could happen. The letter writers also emphasize the need for respect and safety for both Jewish and Muslim communities in a diverse Australia."
