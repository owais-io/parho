title: "Trump’s plan to drill in Venezuela could damage the climate, experts warn"
summary: "Trump wants to boost oil production in Venezuela after seizing the country, but climate scientists say it would add huge carbon emissions and hurt global warming efforts. Venezuela’s heavy, dirty oil would release more CO₂ than the UK or Brazil with just a modest increase. Oil companies would need billions to repair old rigs and face political risks. Experts say the short‑term money isn’t worth the long‑term climate damage."
