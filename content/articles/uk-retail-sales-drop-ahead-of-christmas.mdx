title: "UK Retail Sales Drop Ahead of Christmas"
summary: "Retail sales in Britain fell just 0.1% in November, the first decline in two months, even though analysts expected a rise because of Black Friday. The discounts didn’t push shoppers as hard this year, and online sales dropped almost 3%. Supermarkets and jewellery also slipped, but non‑food stores like department shops saw a small 1% lift. Weather, possible tax hikes, and uncertainty before the budget dampened confidence, though it may lift again in December."
