title: "US bans five Europeans for trying to silence American voices on tech platforms"
summary: "The U.S. State Department has barred five Europeans—including former EU commissioner Thierry Breton—from entering the country. Officials say they worked to pressure tech companies to censor or silence American viewpoints, part of a broader fight against the EU’s Digital Services Act. The five were named by the administration: Breton, Imran Ahmed, Josephine Ballon, Anna‑Lena von Hodenberg, Clare Melford. The move is seen by Washington as a defense of free speech against European regulation."
