title: "Tech Firms Profit From Trump’s AI Order"
summary: "Tech companies have won by backing Trump’s order that stops states from regulating AI, giving them a boost and letting them avoid new rules. They’ve donated money, hosted dinners, and lobbied hard, warning that rules could let China get ahead. Meanwhile, OpenAI is feeling pressure after Google’s new AI Gemini, so it’s boosting ads and TV spots. Some firms are even building data centers in space to cut cooling costs and use solar power."
