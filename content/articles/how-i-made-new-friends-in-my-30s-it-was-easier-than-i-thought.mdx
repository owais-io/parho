title: "How I Made New Friends in My 30s – It Was Easier Than I Thought"
summary: "Many people think it’s hard to make friends after 30, but I found it was actually easier. I joined apps like Bumble BFF and Timeleft, met strangers who wanted new friends, and a few became close pals. I also used everyday spots—coffee shops, festivals, co‑working spaces—to meet people. The key was staying open and giving myself time. Now I have a small, happy circle of friends in my city."
