title: "EU and India Sign Major Free‑Trade Deal"
summary: "India and the EU have just finished a big trade deal that will cut tariffs and open markets for both sides. European products like cars and wine will face lower duties in India, while Indian goods such as textiles and pharmaceuticals will be easier to sell in Europe. The deal could double EU exports to India by 2032, saving European companies billions in taxes. It still needs approval from EU states, the parliament, and India before it takes effect."
