title: "UK Plans to Lower Train Driver Minimum Age to 18"
summary: "Britain is planning to lower the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 to fight a looming driver shortage. Less than 3% of current train drivers are under 30, and a quarter will retire before 2030. The move, backed by the Aslef union, hopes to bring fresh talent, increase diversity, and keep trains running smoothly. Drivers in other European countries can start at 18, so the UK is catching up."
