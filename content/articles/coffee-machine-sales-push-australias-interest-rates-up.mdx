title: "Coffee Machine Sales Push Australia’s Interest Rates Up"
summary: "Last year, many Australians used tax refunds and lower mortgage rates to buy big items like coffee machines, armchairs and air fryers. These purchases lifted prices, especially for durable goods and housing. The Reserve Bank of Australia said this extra demand was widening inflation, so it raised interest rates after a long period of cuts. Even though household debt is high, people are still buying, which may keep prices high."
