title: "Measles Outbreak Swells Across the U.S., Threatening to End Eliminated Status"
summary: "A measles outbreak that started in Texas last year is now spiking to 664 cases in South Carolina alone, and the virus has spread to 15 states, including North Carolina, Ohio, Washington, Arizona and Utah. Most of the people infected are unvaccinated children, and the rise in cases could mean the U.S. loses its measles‑elimination status. Public health officials say misinformation from anti‑vaccine voices and higher school exemptions are driving the spread."
