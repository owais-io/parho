title: "Trump Shuts Down Key Climate‑Science Center"
summary: "The Trump administration announced it would close the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), a top U.S. climate‑science lab. The move is part of a broader effort to cut climate research funding and downplay climate change, with officials saying the center fuels “alarmist” claims. Many scientists lost jobs or budgets, and the decision follows ties between the president and oil‑gas interests. Experts say the shutdown hurts climate science and could increase climate risks."
