title: "Voters Share Responsibility for Britain’s Decline"
summary: "Right‑wing populists blame outsiders and the elite for Britain’s problems, but the article shows that voters have helped make those problems happen. People’s changing habits—shopping online, eating imported foods, fewer children, and a desire to travel abroad—have hurt pubs, local shops and manufacturing. By voting for leaders who pushed austerity, Brexit and a hard‑border stance, voters made the very problems they now scold. This shows voters share responsibility."
