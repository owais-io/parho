title: "UK should stay in European human rights treaty, says equalities chief"
summary: "Mary‑Ann Stephenson, chair of Britain’s Equality and Human Rights Commission, says leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) would be a mistake. She argues the convention protects basic rights that people rely on, and that calling migrants villains hurts both them and ethnic minorities. Removing the ECHR would weaken protections in areas like police accountability and family rights, and the government’s asylum rule changes risk undermining these rights."
