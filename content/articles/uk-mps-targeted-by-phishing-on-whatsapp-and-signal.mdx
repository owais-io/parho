title: "UK MPs Targeted by Phishing on WhatsApp and Signal"
summary: "UK MPs and officials are getting more phishing attacks on WhatsApp and Signal, mainly from Russian-based hackers. The messages look like official support requests and trick users into giving codes, clicking links, or scanning QR codes. If they do, attackers can read private messages and see contacts. Parliament warns people to stop using commercial apps for work, use Teams instead, turn on two‑factor authentication, check for unknown devices, and sign up for NCSC alerts."
