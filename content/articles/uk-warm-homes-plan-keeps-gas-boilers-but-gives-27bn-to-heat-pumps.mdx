summary: "The UK government’s new £15bn Warm Homes Plan will keep gas boilers in homes but will give £2.7bn to heat pumps and insulation. It aims to cut energy bills by up to £1,000 a year and help 1 million people out of fuel poverty. The plan also offers loans, subsidies, and requires landlords to make rentals energy‑efficient. It’s a big push for greener homes, even though no ban on new gas boilers is set."
