title: "Survivors of abuse need safe homes first"
summary: "The UK’s new plan to protect women and girls from violence is promising, but it falls short if it doesn’t provide enough safe housing. Without a secure home, survivors can’t rebuild, find work or get support. Housing associations can offer safe accommodation plus trauma‑informed care. The government must fund long‑term, inclusive housing solutions so everyone—men, children, disabled people and minorities—has a place to start over."
