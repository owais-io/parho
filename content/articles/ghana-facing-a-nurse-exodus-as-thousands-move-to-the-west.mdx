title: "Ghana Facing a Nurse Exodus as Thousands Move to the West"
summary: "Ghana is losing thousands of nurses to countries like the US, UK, and the Caribbean. They leave because they earn very little, sometimes get no pay, and hospitals are badly equipped. The government says it has too many nurses and is sending them abroad, but health workers warn it’s a crisis. Some nurses, like Bright Ansah, stay to help at home, while others like Nana Yaa Mills move to the US for a better life."
