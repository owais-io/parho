title: "Some Exams Might Move to Laptops by 2030, Says Ofqual"
summary: "England’s exam regulator, Ofqual, is asking the public for opinions on letting students take some GCSE and A‑level exams on laptops by the end of the decade. The idea is to create on‑screen tests for subjects that don’t attract many candidates, like German, while keeping papers for maths. Schools would decide whether to offer laptop or paper versions. The move raises worries about device access, security, and fair treatment, so Ofqual is being cautious."
