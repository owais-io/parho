title: "Norway Sold Only 7 Petrol Cars in January"
summary: "In January, Norway registered just seven new petrol cars, while more than 2,000 electric vehicles were sold. Sales of all types were low because people bought in December to avoid a tax hike. The tiny number of petrol cars shows how fast Norway is moving away from fossil‑fuel cars, with electric cars making up almost 96% of new sales last year. The trend is also seen in the used‑car market, where electric cars grew 22.7%."
