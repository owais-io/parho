title: "International Humanitarian Law Is at Risk, but Still Relevant"
summary: "Kenneth Roth argues that while wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and the DRC are showing shocking attacks on civilians, international humanitarian law (IHL) is not dying. He explains that the law is still being enforced through UN condemnations, ICC charges and global protests. But the response is uneven, especially when powerful countries use vetoes or ignore abuses. Roth calls for stronger, consistent action to protect civilians and keep IHL alive."
