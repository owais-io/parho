summary: "Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, says the UK’s new tax and wage rules are hurting young workers. National insurance for employers jumped and the minimum wage is being equalised, which has pushed 16‑24‑year‑old unemployment to 16.1%—the highest in a decade and above the EU average. The overall jobless rate hit a five‑year high of 5.2%. Policymakers fear a long‑term hit to the next generation’s chances of finding work."
