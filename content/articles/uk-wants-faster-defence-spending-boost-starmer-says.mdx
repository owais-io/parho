title: "UK Wants Faster Defence Spending Boost, Starmer Says"
summary: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain must speed up defence spending, but an immediate jump to 3% of GDP by 2029 is unlikely. The Treasury and Ministry of Defence are still arguing over the investment plan, which affects jobs like the 3,000 at Leonardo’s Yeovil factory. Starmer wants quicker budget moves, citing Russia as an ongoing threat, the plan could cost £13‑17bn, and the need for European self‑reliance."
