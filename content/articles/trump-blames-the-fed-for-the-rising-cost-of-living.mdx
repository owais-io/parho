title: "Trump Blames the Fed for the Rising Cost of Living"
summary: "Trump is pointing the finger at the Federal Reserve, saying the Fed’s policies are hurting Americans’ budgets. He wants voters to see him as the solution to the cost‑of‑living crisis, even though his own tax cuts mainly help the rich and he hasn’t passed laws to lower housing, childcare, or health costs. Critics say his attacks on the Fed are just political spin, not real change."
