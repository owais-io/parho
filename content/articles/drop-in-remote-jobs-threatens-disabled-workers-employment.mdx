title: "Drop in Remote Jobs Threatens Disabled Workers' Employment"
summary: "A two‑year study found that fewer jobs are offering fully remote or hybrid work, which is a problem for people with disabilities who need home‑based jobs. The research shows that almost nine in ten disabled job‑seekers say remote work is essential. With only about 4 % of UK job ads now fully remote, unemployment among disabled people has risen sharply. Employers cutting remote roles could push many disabled workers out of work."
