title: "Nigel Farage Turns Reform Party into a Game Show"
summary: "Farage staged a press conference that looked like a new version of The Weakest Link, turning his Reform party into a game‑show set. He gave his staff odd titles – from business and trade to shadow chancellor – and pushed people into roles that suited him. The event was all about Farage, with his team getting short introductions and then being pushed back into the background. He was visibly arrogant, dismissing questions and mocking reporters."
