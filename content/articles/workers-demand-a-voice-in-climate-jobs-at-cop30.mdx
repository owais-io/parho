title: "Workers Demand a Voice in Climate Jobs at Cop30"
summary: "At the Cop30 climate talks in Brazil, workers from all over the world are saying their jobs matter. They want a say in how new green jobs are made and how old, polluting jobs change. A plan called the Belém Action Mechanism (Bam) would let workers help shape policies, making sure jobs are good, safe, and fair. A big group of countries even backed the idea, hoping the shift to a green economy is just for everyone."
