title: "Scientists Warn Earth May Slip Into Unavoidable Climate Chaos"
summary: "Scientists say the world is nearing a “point of no return” where runaway warming will become unstoppable. Even a 1.3 °C rise is already causing deadly extreme weather. If temperatures reach 3–4 °C, society could collapse, and beyond that a “hothouse Earth” could lock in much higher heat for thousands of years. The study highlights several tipping points—ice sheets, forests, oceans—that may already be shifting. Current pledges are far too low to avoid this outcome."
