title: "UK pickup trucks double in a decade"
summary: "The number of US‑style pickup trucks in the UK has almost doubled over the past ten years, rising 92% to about 600,000 cars. They’re larger and more polluting than normal cars and create big blind‑spots that hide children from drivers. In cities the trucks are too big for narrow streets and can cause more serious injuries to pedestrians. Campaigners want higher parking fees and stricter safety tests."
