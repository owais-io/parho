title: "EU weakens 2035 car ban, hurting climate goals"
summary: "The EU had promised to stop selling new petrol and diesel cars by 2035 to help hit climate targets. But now, after pressure from German and Italian car makers, Brussels is proposing a loophole that would let these cars be sold past the deadline. This move could delay Europe’s push toward electric vehicles, hurt its climate goals, and give an advantage to Chinese rivals."
