title: "One in Six Autistic Kids in the UK Haven’t Been to School Since September"
summary: "A new survey by Ambitious About Autism shows that about 16% of autistic pupils in the UK have not attended school at all this year. Most absences are blamed on mental‑health problems, anxiety, sensory overload or unsuitable school settings. Parents feel the government is “blaming” them and worry that planned changes to the SEND system won’t give enough support. The government plans to increase training and specialist places, but many families fear the reforms won’t be enough."
