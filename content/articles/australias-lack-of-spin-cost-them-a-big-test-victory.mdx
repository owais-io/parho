title: "Australia’s Lack of Spin Cost Them a Big Test Victory"
summary: "Australia’s Ashes team used only fast bowlers, leaving out specialist spin. This made their attack one‑dimensional, so England piled up a huge first‑innings score of 384, with Joe Root smashing 160. The selectors and captain, convinced seamers were best on the Sydney pitch, kept spinners off the field, even turning to part‑timers who couldn’t offer real variation. The missing spin meant Australia had fewer options and struggled to break England’s long partnership."
