title: "French Island: A Quiet, Remote Escape From Melbourne"
summary: "French Island is a quiet, 70‑km‑away haven that you can reach only by a small ferry or barge. With just 139 people, no council, no mains water or police station, residents live off‑grid and love the wildlife—ibises, spoonbills, and many koalas that now over‑populate the trees. The island resists big development, keeping it natural and fox‑free. Locals cherish the peace but wish more young families and schools would move in."
