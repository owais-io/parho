title: "Native American Patrols Guard Minneapolis Neighborhood from ICE"
summary: "In Minneapolis, Native American residents set up community patrols to watch for ICE agents during a federal immigration crackdown. Volunteers gather around a fire pit, keep a lookout, and help people who might be stopped. Many Native people were detained even though they are U.S. citizens, so tribal leaders issued new tribal IDs on the spot. The patrols also provide hand‑warmers and whistles, and try to keep kids and elders safe."
