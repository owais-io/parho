title: "Tiny Tomato Planters and Drought‑Resistant Roses Are Next Year’s Garden Hits"
summary: "The Royal Horticultural Society says next year gardeners will ditch cut‑flower bouquets for small pots of tomatoes, peppers, chillies and aubergines that grow on kitchen windowsills. They’re also getting better at picking roses that can survive hot, dry weather by crossing them with a tough Asian type. Other trends include plants that can move indoors and outdoors, and clever ways to save water like small water‑butts and even smart AI systems. These ideas are already boosting sales this year."
