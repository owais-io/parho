title: "UK Students Can Join Erasmus Again After Brexit – £570m Cost"
summary: "From 2027 the UK will re‑join the EU’s Erasmus+ programme, letting students, apprentices and adult learners study or work abroad. The government will spend £570 million, partly funded by a 30 % discount negotiated with Brussels. About 100,000 people could benefit in the first year. The deal was part of Labour’s promise to improve ties with the EU, but critics say it is too expensive."
