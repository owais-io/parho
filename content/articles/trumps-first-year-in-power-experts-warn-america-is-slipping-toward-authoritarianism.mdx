title: "Trump’s First Year in Power: Experts Warn America is Slipping Toward Authoritarianism"
summary: "Donald Trump was re‑elected and in his first year back at the White House, scholars say he has moved the U.S. toward authoritarianism. He fired watchdogs, cut federal agencies, and used federal force in protest cities. Ratings of American democracy fell sharply, with some experts calling the country “competitive authoritarian.” While some say the decline is overstated, others warn that the loss of checks could be reversed if voters stay engaged. The next mid‑term election may be key."
