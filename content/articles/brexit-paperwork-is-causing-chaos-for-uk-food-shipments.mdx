title: "Brexit paperwork is causing chaos for UK food shipments"
summary: "Toby Ovens told MPs that the post‑Brexit paperwork is a nightmare. His loads of lamb and beef were stuck in Calais for weeks because UK paperwork didn’t match EU stamps, costing him £16,000 to keep a truck in the port. The system now needs 26 stamps, compared with one before Brexit. MPs say the extra red tape is costing the UK £8.4 bn and hurting trade. Brussels and London will meet next week to try to cut the bureaucracy."
