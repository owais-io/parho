title: "UK Unpaid Carers Need More Support, Report Says"
summary: "Researchers say about 1 million people in the UK give unpaid care for 35 hours a week or more. Most of them are from low‑income families and find it hard to work. The study shows a third of carers in poorer households can’t work because of care duties. The government has increased the carer's allowance threshold and offers breaks, but it still faces problems like overpayments and the need for paid leave. The report urges better help for these unpaid “unsung army” carers."
