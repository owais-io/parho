title: "Teenagers Share Shabana Mahmood’s Immigration Views"
summary: "Twenty years ago, I interviewed 15‑year‑olds in a Manchester school that mixed white British and second‑generation immigrant kids. I was surprised when the immigrant children said, “The country is full,” echoing Shabana Mahmood’s hard‑line stance on immigration. I’d thought they were just copying their parents. The white kids were more welcoming. The author notes that past Conservative ministers, like his late father‑in‑law Robert Carr, showed empathy toward refugees, while newer leaders have adopted a “drawbridge” approach."
