title: "Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, will meet Donald Trump in Florida."
summary: "The meeting will happen at Mar‑a‑Lago, the former president’s home.   It is the first time they will talk face‑to‑face since October. Why are they meeting?   Russia has been fighting in Ukraine for almost four years.   Both sides want a peace plan.   Trump helped draft a plan, but Russia has not agreed to it yet. What will they talk about?   1. **The Donbas region** – the area in eastern Ukraine.      Russia wants all of it.      Ukraine says it will not give up any land it still controls.   2. **The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant** – the biggest nuclear site in Ukraine.      Both sides want to know who will run it after the war.   3. **Security guarantees** – Ukraine wants a promise from the U.S. or NATO that it will be protected if Russia attacks again.   4. **Money for rebuilding** – how much money Ukraine will get to fix the war damage. Russia keeps saying it will stay in the Donbas, even the parts still held by Ukraine.   Zelenskyy says he wants a free economic zone instead of giving up land.   Trump says he is open to a good meeting but has not yet approved the plan. In short:   - Trump and Zelenskyy will meet.   - They will discuss how to end the war.   - The big issues are territory, the nuclear plant, and future protection for Ukraine."
