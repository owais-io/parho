title: "Gavin Newsom’s 2028 Presidential Bid: Broken Promises and Trump‑style Tactics"
summary: "Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, is eyeing a 2028 presidential run. He’s been copying Trump’s style—shouting and insulting on social media—to win voters, but his record as governor is full of broken promises. He once pledged a single‑payer health plan, 3.5 million homes, a homeless czar, and a reparations task force, yet most of those promises fell through. Critics say he’s hypocritical, bowing to big‑tech donors while shaming other leaders. The article questions whether voters will accept such a pattern."
