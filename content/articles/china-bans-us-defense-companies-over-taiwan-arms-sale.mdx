title: "China bans U.S. defense companies over Taiwan arms sale"
summary: "China slapped sanctions on 10 people and 20 U.S. defense firms, including Boeing, after Washington approved a $10 billion arms package for Taiwan. The penalties freeze assets in China and stop Chinese firms from doing business with the targets. The deal, the biggest in U.S.–Taiwan history, included missiles and drones. China says any support for Taiwan is a “red line” and will retaliate. U.S. law requires it to help Taiwan defend itself."
