title: "Reddit Faces £14.5m Fine Over Kids' Data Use"
summary: "The UK regulator, the Information Commissioner’s Office, fined Reddit £14.5 million for illegally collecting data from users under 13. The fine follows findings that Reddit relied on self‑declared ages, which is unreliable, and that it failed to assess risks to children. The court said the data was used without children’s consent, potentially exposing them to harmful content. It’s the third‑largest fine the regulator has issued, and Reddit will appeal."
