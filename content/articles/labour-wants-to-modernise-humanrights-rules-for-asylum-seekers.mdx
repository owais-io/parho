title: "Labour Wants to Modernise Human‑Rights Rules for Asylum Seekers"
summary: "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says Europe’s human‑rights treaty (ECHR) needs updating because today's migration is different from when it was written. He wants stricter asylum rules so that people who use the system for economic reasons can be deported. He warns that ignoring the problem lets right‑wing politicians threaten refugees' rights. Critics say the move looks political, not a real defence of core values."
