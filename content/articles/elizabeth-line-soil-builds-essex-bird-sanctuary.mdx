title: "Elizabeth Line Soil Builds Essex Bird Sanctuary"
summary: "A huge amount of soil moved from London’s new Elizabeth line was used to build a wetland on Wallasea Island, Essex. The RSPB turned the land into a bird haven, removing a sea wall, making islands, lagoons and salt marshes. Now more than 39,000 birds, including avocets and waders, live there each winter. The project also helps keep the island safe from floods, showing that big construction projects can help nature too."
