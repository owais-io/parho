title: "Britain’s Reparations Debate: What Happens Next?"
summary: "A book called The Big Payback explains reparations simply, showing it’s not about guilt but responsibility. In 2025 Caribbean and African leaders pushed Britain to act, but the UK’s response was lukewarm, even ignoring a Caricom delegation. Meanwhile the African Union announced a decade of reparations, and the UK’s immigration rules have become harsher for former colonies. Reparations are no longer a fringe idea – they’re now a central question about Britain’s future ties with Africa and the Caribbean."
