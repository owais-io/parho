title: "Assisted Dying Bill Faces Deadline as Lords Stall"
summary: "Supporters of a law that would let people with a terminal illness choose assisted dying say it may not finish in time. The House of Lords is using long debates to block it, leaving only a few days before Parliament ends in May. The bill has passed the Commons and similar laws in Jersey and the Isle of Man, but the Lords’ opponents are using procedural tricks to delay it. If it fails, it could be re‑introduced next session."
