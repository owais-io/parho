title: "England lose to Sri Lanka, opening choice backfires"
summary: "England lost to Sri Lanka in the opening ODI, extending their home losing streak to 11. The team had brought back opener Zak Crawley after two years out of the format, hoping a new partnership would help. Crawley was out cheaply, showing the deeper problems in England’s selection process and the lack of a regular domestic 50‑over competition. The only bright spot was Ben Duckett’s 62. The match highlighted cracks in how England builds its one‑day team."
