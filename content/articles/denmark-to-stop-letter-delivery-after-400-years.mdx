title: "Denmark to Stop Letter Delivery After 400 Years"
summary: "Denmark will stop delivering letters next week, ending 400 years of post service and cutting 1,500 jobs. The move shows a bigger trend: more countries are trimming mail services as people use email, online payments and instant messaging. France is removing postboxes, Germany is cutting thousands of jobs, and the UK’s Royal Mail has dropped letter volumes from 20bn to 6.6bn. The decline is driven by digital convenience, though some people still rely on physical mail."
