title: "Syrian Army Seizes IS Camp; Riots and Escape Attempts Follow"
summary: "In north‑eastern Syria, the Syrian army seized al‑Hawl, the world’s largest camp for people suspected of joining the Islamic State. The takeover came after Kurdish guards left, sparking riots, a burning bakery, and escape attempts by women and children. Camp residents—many of whom have no real ties to the group—are living in harsh, overcrowded conditions with little food or water. The government says it will guard the camp and release those without evidence of crimes."
