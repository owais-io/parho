title: "Trump’s Attempt to End Thailand‑Cambodia Conflict Fails"
summary: "Donald Trump recently claimed he helped end wars in places like the Congo, but his promise to stop fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has already collapsed. The two sides stopped fighting in July, but clashes restarted soon after. About half a million people fled the border, and more than 20 people died. The dispute is old, fueled by national pride, and politics in both countries keep the tension alive."
