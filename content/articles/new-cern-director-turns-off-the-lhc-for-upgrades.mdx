title: "New CERN Director Turns Off the LHC for Upgrades"
summary: "New CERN director Mark Thomson will shut down the Large Hadron Collider to upgrade it. The LHC will stop running for months while scientists install new magnets that make collisions ten times more frequent. Thomson, a Cambridge professor, sees the upgrade as a chance to find new physics and to prepare for the future, possibly the 91‑km Future Circular Collider. He’s also juggling Europe’s big science budget and the race against other countries."
