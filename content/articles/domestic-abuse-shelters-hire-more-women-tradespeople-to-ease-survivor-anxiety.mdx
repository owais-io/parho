title: "Domestic abuse shelters hire more women tradespeople to ease survivor anxiety"
summary: "Domestic abuse shelters are hiring more women tradespeople because men in the trade can trigger trauma in survivors. Refuge runs 64 homes and only 4 % of UK trades are women, but the numbers are rising. The charity works with the online directory TaskHer to find female electricians, plumbers and decorators, easing residents’ anxiety. This helps LGBTQ+ clients and those with religious reasons avoid male contractors. Despite some sexism, the growing presence of women in construction is a positive change."
