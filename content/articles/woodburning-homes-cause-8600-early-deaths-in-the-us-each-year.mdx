title: "Wood‑burning homes cause 8,600 early deaths in the US each year"
summary: "A new study shows that burning wood in homes kills about 8,600 Americans before their time every year. Although only a small fraction of houses use wood for heating, the smoke makes up 21 % of winter pollution. The problem hits suburbs, cities, and even warm places like Los Angeles. People of colour are more exposed and hurt. Switching to cleaner heating could save many lives. The UK faces a similar issue."
