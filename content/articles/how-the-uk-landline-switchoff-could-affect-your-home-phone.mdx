title: "How the UK Landline Switch‑Off Could Affect Your Home Phone"
summary: "UK telecoms are ditching traditional landlines for internet‑based home phones, with the final switch set for January 2027. About 3.2 million homes still need to switch, and while most customers have had no trouble, the move has hit some vulnerable groups hard. In December 2025 Virgin Media was fined £23.8 million for leaving thousands—mostly elderly and disabled—without their telecare alarms during the transition. The government wants to hear how this change might affect you or your family."
