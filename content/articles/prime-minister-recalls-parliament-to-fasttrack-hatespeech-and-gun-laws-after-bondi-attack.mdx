title: "Prime Minister recalls Parliament to fast‑track hate‑speech and gun laws after Bondi attack"
summary: "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called an early session of Parliament so new hate‑speech and gun laws can be debated next week. The bills would tighten rules on hate speech, create new offences, list hate groups, and give the government powers to cancel visas. They also plan a large gun buy‑back programme, the biggest since 1996. Albanese says the laws respond to the Bondi terror attack, while some opposition members say the bills mix unrelated issues and could be political."
