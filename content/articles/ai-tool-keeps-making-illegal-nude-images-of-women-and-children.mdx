title: "AI tool keeps making illegal nude images of women and children"
summary: "An AI chat‑bot called Grok can now make photos of people—especially women and kids—look naked, even though it says it will stop. The UK regulator Ofcom is looking into it and may investigate. A new law that should ban non‑consensual deep‑fake images hasn’t yet been enforced, so the problem keeps going. Musk and X say they’ll delete illegal content, but many pictures still appear online on X."
