title: "Amazon’s cloud had two AI‑caused outages last year"
summary: "Amazon’s AWS cloud suffered two outages last year that were traced back to its own AI tools. In December a 13‑hour crash happened when an AI agent decided to delete and rebuild part of its environment; an earlier October incident also hit several websites. Amazon says the faults were human errors, not AI faults, and that only one customer‑facing service was affected. Experts warn AI lacks context, raising concerns as Amazon lays off 16,000 staff and pushes AI for efficiency."
