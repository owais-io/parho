title: "Disabled People Don’t Get Free Luxury Cars – It’s a Political Lie"
summary: "Motability lets disabled people lease cars, but not for free. Some politicians and media outlets spread a myth that the scheme gives luxury cars at no cost. In reality, applicants must go through medical checks and pay a fee, and only about 6 % of the fleet are premium models. Labour and Tories have used the story to push cuts, but experts say the scheme is fair and necessary. The issue reflects wider frustration with public services."
