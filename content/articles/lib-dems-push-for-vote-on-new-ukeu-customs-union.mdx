title: "Lib Dems Push for Vote on New UK‑EU Customs Union"
summary: "The Liberal Democrats are pushing a vote on a bill that would set up a new customs union between the UK and the EU. They want Labour MPs to back it, saying it would cut red‑tapey barriers, boost growth and add at least £25 bn to public finances each year. The proposal is symbolic and unlikely to pass because the government opposes it, but it signals pro‑EU sentiment in Parliament."
