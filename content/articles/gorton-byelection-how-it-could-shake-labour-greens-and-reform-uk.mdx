title: "Gorton Byelection: How It Could Shake Labour, Greens and Reform UK"
summary: "The Gorton byelection is a tight race that could shake up Labour, the Greens and Reform UK. A win for Reform would show Farage’s support and split the left, hurting Labour’s lead. A Green victory would hit Labour’s coalition and raise doubts about its ability to unite progressive voters. If Labour keeps the seat, it would keep Prime Minister Starmer’s premiership safe but keep tensions high."
