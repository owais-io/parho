title: "California GOP asks Supreme Court to stop voter‑approved redistricting map"
summary: "In California, the Republican Party wants the state Supreme Court to block a map that voters approved last November. The new map could give Democrats up to five seats in the U.S. House. Republicans argue it uses race to favor Latino voters and violates federal law. A federal court rejected their claim, but the GOP now seeks a quick injunction before the next primary. The decision could affect control of Congress in 2026."
