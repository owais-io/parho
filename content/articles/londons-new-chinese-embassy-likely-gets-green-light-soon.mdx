title: "London’s new Chinese embassy likely gets green light soon"
summary: "After years of back‑and‑forth, the UK is expected to approve China’s huge new embassy in London next week. The project sits on a £255 million site near the Royal Mint and has stalled since 2018 when the local council refused permission. Approval would ease tensions before UK Prime Minister Starmer visits Beijing, but security and protest concerns remain."
