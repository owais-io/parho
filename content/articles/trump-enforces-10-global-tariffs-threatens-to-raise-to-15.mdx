title: "Trump Enforces 10% Global Tariffs, Threatens to Raise to 15%"
summary: "Trump has put a blanket 10% tax on imports from most countries after a court stopped his earlier tariffs. He says he might raise the rate to 15% if the deal backfires. The move throws uncertainty on businesses that export to the U.S., especially in the UK and Europe, and could push prices higher. Oil prices are already high because of Middle‑East tension, adding pressure."
