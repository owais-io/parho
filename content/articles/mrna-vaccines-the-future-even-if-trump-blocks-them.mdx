title: "mRNA vaccines: The future, even if Trump blocks them"
summary: "The Guardian says mRNA vaccines, born from quick Covid trials, could change medicine forever. But Trump’s government is cutting funding, backing anti‑vaccine voices, and slowing approval. The cuts threaten US leadership and could hurt trust in vaccines. Europe and the UK could step up, with new money and facilities, to keep mRNA research alive. The technology still looks promising for flu, cancer, and HIV, but it needs steady support and regulation. That’s the gist."
