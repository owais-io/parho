summary: "A measles outbreak in London is hurting unvaccinated kids under 10, and worldwide cases are climbing. The UK lost its measles‑free status, and experts urge higher vaccine rates. Measles spreads through coughs, sneezes and close contact, and can cause serious illness or death, especially in babies and the immunocompromised.
