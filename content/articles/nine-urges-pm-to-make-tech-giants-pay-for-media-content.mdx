title: "Nine Urges PM to Make Tech Giants Pay for Media Content"
summary: "Nine CEO Matt Stanton told investors that the Australian prime minister must act to make tech giants pay for news. He said a new news‑bargaining law should be pushed through before 2026, because AI and “zero‑click” searches cut traffic to news sites. Nine also announced deals to train its own AI models and said its revenue fell 4 % but profits rose thanks to cost cuts. The company is shifting to digital and subscriptions."
