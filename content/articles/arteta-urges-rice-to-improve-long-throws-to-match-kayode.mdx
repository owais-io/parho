summary: "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has urged midfielder Declan Rice to work on his long throw‑ins, saying they should reach the level of Michael Kayode, the Premier League’s best thrower. Kayode can deliver throws over 30 metres, which have helped Brentford score three goals this season. Arteta said the weapon is chaotic and hard to predict but can be trained.
