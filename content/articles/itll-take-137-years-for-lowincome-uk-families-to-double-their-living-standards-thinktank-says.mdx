title: "It’ll Take 137 Years for Low‑Income UK Families to Double Their Living Standards, Thinktank Says"
summary: "It will take more than 137 years for the living standards of the UK’s lowest‑income families to double, a Resolution Foundation study finds. Since 2005, disposable incomes have barely grown – just 0.5% a year – after a 20‑year boom. The thinktank says 13 million working‑age households are stuck, with many caring for disabled relatives and paying high council taxes, while wage growth stalls and benefits cut."
