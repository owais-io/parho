title: "US lied about Iraq, so Europe ignored its warning on Ukraine"
summary: "The Guardian article explains how U.S. intelligence agencies, the CIA and MI6, had warned Europe that Russia would invade Ukraine, but many European leaders chose to ignore those warnings. They did so because the U.S. and U.K. had lost trust after lying about weapons in Iraq. The result was that when Russia attacked Kyiv in 2022, Europe was unprepared. The article says that losing credibility hurts power, and that Ukraine is now paying the price."
