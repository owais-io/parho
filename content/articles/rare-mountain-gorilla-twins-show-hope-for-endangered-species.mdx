title: "Rare Mountain Gorilla Twins Show Hope for Endangered Species"
summary: "In Virunga National Park, a mother gorilla named Mafuko has given birth to twins – the first double birth in 2024. Rangers watch them closely as newborns face high risk. The twins are healthy so far, but gorilla babies often die from disease or injury. The event is a bright spot in a long conservation story that has raised the mountain gorilla population from 250 to over 1,000. Yet the park remains dangerous for staff."
