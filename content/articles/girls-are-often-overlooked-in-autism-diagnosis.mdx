title: "Girls Are Often Overlooked in Autism Diagnosis"
summary: "A new Swedish study looked at more than 2.7 million people born between 1985 and 2020 to see who was diagnosed with autism. It found boys are diagnosed about three years earlier than girls and are three to four times more likely to get a diagnosis before age 10. By age 20 the gap almost disappears, meaning girls are often diagnosed late or not at all. Doctors and tests may be biased, leaving many girls without needed support."
