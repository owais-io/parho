title: "Britain Won’t Strip Activist Alaa Abd el‑Fattah’s Citizenship Over Old Tweets"
summary: "Britain decided not to take away the citizenship of Egyptian‑British activist Alaa Abd el‑Fattah, even though he posted hateful tweets a decade ago that many call racist and violent. The Home Office said the law requires stronger evidence, like fraud or terrorism, before revoking citizenship. Critics say using citizenship as punishment is a slippery slope, and politicians should not have the power to strip it. The activist has apologized for his old posts."
