summary: "Nigel Farage said he was “sorry” if he had hurt anyone, but denied that his past behaviour was racist or antisemitic. The comment came after a Guardian investigation that named 34 former Dulwich College classmates who say he bullied them with racist and antisemitic language. Filmmaker Peter Ettedgui, one of the accusers, demands a full apology and questions how Farage’s old views shape his politics."
