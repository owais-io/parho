title: "Original Factory Shop Goes into Administration, 1,200 Jobs at Risk"
summary: "The home‑ware chain Original Factory Shop has entered administration, putting about 1,200 staff jobs in jeopardy. The 137‑store retailer, bought by Modella Capital less than a year ago, said higher costs, weak consumer confidence and government policies pushed the business into a loss. Interpath will run the shop while looking for a way forward, and orders placed before 28 Jan will still be delivered. The move highlights the struggle of high‑street retailers amid rising inflation and shifting consumer habits."
