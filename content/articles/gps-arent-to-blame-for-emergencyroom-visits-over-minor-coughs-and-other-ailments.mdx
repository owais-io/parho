title: "GPs Aren’t to Blame for Emergency‑Room Visits Over Minor Coughs and Other Ailments"
summary: "GPs aren’t to blame for emergency‑room visits over minor coughs and other ailments. In England, more people go to A&E because hospital beds are scarce, not because GPs can’t help. The system is stretched with 250,000 extra GP appointments a day. Yet there are 750 fewer GPs than a decade ago, and each earns only 34p a day. More doctors and funding are needed for real change."
