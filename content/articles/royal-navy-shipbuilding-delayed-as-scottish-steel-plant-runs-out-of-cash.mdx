title: "Royal Navy shipbuilding delayed as Scottish steel plant runs out of cash"
summary: "A Scottish steel plant, Liberty Steel Dalzell, can’t buy the slabs it needs because it has no cash, which delays the supply of 34,000 tonnes of steel for three Royal Navy warships. The plant, owned by Sanjeev Gupta, is in financial trouble and has not filed accounts for years. Sir David Murray has offered to take over the plant, and the UK government has spent £274 m on it. Workers are still paid 80 %."
