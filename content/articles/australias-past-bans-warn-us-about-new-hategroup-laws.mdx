title: "Australia’s Past Bans Warn Us About New Hate‑Group Laws"
summary: "Australia has banned political groups before, like the Communist Party and others, often during war. Courts said many of those bans were unfair and overstepped the law. Now the government wants to ban groups that spread hate, even if they haven’t committed a crime, and without a fair hearing. The new rules rely on treaty promises, not wartime powers. History shows such bans can be abused, so people are worried."
