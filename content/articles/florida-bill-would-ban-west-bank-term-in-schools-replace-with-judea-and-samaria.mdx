title: "Florida Bill Would Ban “West Bank” Term in Schools, Replace With “Judea and Samaria”"
summary: "Florida lawmakers want to ban the term “West Bank” in public schools, state agencies, and universities. The bill would force all materials to use “Judea and Samaria” instead. The move reflects a broader push by some Republicans to change how the territory is called, but critics say it erases Palestinian history. The proposal has passed a committee and is waiting to be debated in the House. Republicans control both chambers."
