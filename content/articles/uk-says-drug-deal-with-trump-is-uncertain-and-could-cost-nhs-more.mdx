title: "UK Says Drug Deal with Trump Is Uncertain and Could Cost NHS More"
summary: "UK ministers warn that the new pharmaceutical deal with Donald Trump is fragile because it has no formal legal document—just press releases. The NHS would pay higher drug prices in exchange for zero US tariffs, but the UK has not yet signed a binding agreement. Similar worries surround the paused tech deal and unfinished farmer quotas. MPs fear the UK is relying on promises that Trump may not keep, putting the NHS and businesses at risk."
