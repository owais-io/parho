title: "Can you solve these eleven puzzles?"
summary: "The piece gives three puzzles that all revolve around the number eleven. First, it asks you to split a football team’s shirt numbers 1‑11 into defenders, midfielders and forwards so each group’s total is a multiple of eleven. Next, it asks how many multiples of eleven up to 11×99 are palindromes. Finally, it challenges you to create the largest 10‑digit number using each digit 0‑9 once that’s divisible by eleven. It also mentions UK University Maths Schools and invites applications."
