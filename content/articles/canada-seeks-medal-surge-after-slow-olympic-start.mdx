title: "Canada Seeks Medal Surge After Slow Olympic Start"
summary: "Canada’s opening Olympic days were more memes than medals, with a slow start and a curling controversy that sparked a lot of online jokes. But the country’s chances are getting brighter. Freestyle skiers and curlers still have several medals left, and Canadian short‑track skaters and hockey teams can add more. The nation could finish with 20‑plus medals, though it’s unlikely to hit the 14‑gold record of 2010. The U.S. still leads in total medals."
