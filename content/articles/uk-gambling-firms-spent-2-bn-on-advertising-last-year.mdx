title: "UK gambling firms spent £2 bn on advertising last year"
summary: "British gambling companies spent about £2 bn on ads in 2023, far more than the £1.2 bn the Treasury collected from the sector. The figure has politicians and think‑tanks urging the chancellor to raise gambling duties to help public finances. Industry groups say the spend is closer to £1 bn and warn that higher taxes could hurt jobs and push people to illegal operators. The debate continues as the government plans its budget."
