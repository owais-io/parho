summary: "US employers added 130,000 jobs in January, beating the 70,000 forecast and pulling unemployment down to 4.3%. The good monthly bump, however, trims 2025 job growth to just 181,000 – the weakest pace since the pandemic. The report also records a jump in January layoffs and the lowest job openings since 2020, leaving the Fed cautious about cutting rates."
