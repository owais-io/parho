title: "London’s crime rates are at their lowest in history, says Mayor Sadiq Khan"
summary: "London has the lowest rate of murders in its recorded history, Mayor Sadiq Khan says, countering claims that the city is becoming a 'warzone'. The drop comes after the city doubled police funding, added more officers and technology, and launched a Violence Reduction Unit that works with schools and charities to give young people other choices. London’s crime rates are lower than cities like New York and Chicago, but Khan says we must keep working to keep the city safe."
