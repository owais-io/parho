summary: "A federal judge in Maryland freed Kilmar Ábrego García from ICE detention in Pennsylvania after he had been wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador. The judge said the U.S. had no lawful authority to hold him because no final removal order existed. Ábrego, a Salvadoran construction worker living in Maryland with his wife and child, is set to return home. The Department of Homeland Security plans to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism.”"
