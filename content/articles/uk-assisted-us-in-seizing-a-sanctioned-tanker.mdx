title: "UK Assisted US in Seizing a Sanctioned Tanker"
summary: "Britain’s Defence Ministry said it helped US forces take a Russian‑flagged tanker, the Marinera, north‑west of Britain and Ireland. The UK gave the US aircraft bases to plan, extra surveillance flights, and naval refueling, but no British troops boarded the ship. The tanker, once called Bella 1, had been sanctioned for links to Iran and Hezbollah and had changed names and flags to dodge law. Britain says the move was legal, though some MPs ask for clarification."
