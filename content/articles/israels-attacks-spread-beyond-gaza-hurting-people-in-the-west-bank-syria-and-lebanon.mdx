title: "Israel's attacks spread beyond Gaza, hurting people in the West Bank, Syria, and Lebanon"
summary: "After a ceasefire in Gaza, fighting has not stopped. Israel still hits Palestinians daily, killing and wounding hundreds, while blocking aid. The violence spreads to the West Bank, where many homes are demolished and people are being moved out, and to Syria and Lebanon, where Israeli troops have raided villages and bombed towns. Human rights groups say these actions are war crimes and that Israel keeps pushing its power across the region."
