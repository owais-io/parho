title: "Israeli troops launch big raid on Tubas in the West Bank"
summary: "Hundreds of Israeli soldiers with armored vehicles raided the Palestinian town of Tubas near Nablus, the largest deployment since the Gaza ceasefire. A curfew was imposed, roads blocked, and families moved so troops could use houses. The army says it’s a counter‑terrorism operation after leaflets warned the town was a “terrorism haven.” In Gaza, six Hamas fighters were killed near Rafah, while UN and Human Rights Watch report many civilian deaths and displaced thousands, calling forced relocations war crimes."
