title: "Justice Department Lawyers Quit Over Decision Not to Probe ICE Agent Shooting"
summary: "Four top lawyers in the Justice Department’s civil‑rights division left after the division decided not to investigate the January 7 shooting of unarmed Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE agent. The move followed the appointment of Harmeet Dhillon, who shifted the division’s focus away from civil‑rights work. While the FBI is looking into Good’s alleged activist ties, the DOJ said the resignations were unrelated to the shooting. The departures add to a wave of exits after the Trump‑era shift."
