title: "Flooding in Somerset Turns Some Birds into Winners, Others into Losers"
summary: "Heavy winter rain has flooded Somerset’s fields, turning the area into a large wetland. This change has helped some birds, like gulls and lapwings, by providing fresh food and space. A white‑tailed eagle even showed up, but hasn’t caught anything yet. Barn owls struggle because their feathers aren’t waterproof and prey is hidden in the water. When the flood recedes, some species will thrive, while others may be left behind, raising concerns about future storms."
