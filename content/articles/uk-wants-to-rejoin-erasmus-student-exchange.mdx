title: "UK Wants to Rejoin Erasmus Student Exchange"
summary: "The UK is working to get back into the EU’s Erasmus student‑exchange programme. Negotiations aim to finish a deal by January so UK students can travel abroad again from 2027, and UK students can go to Europe. This move is part of the new “reset” talks with Brussels after a recent hit‑and‑miss over defence funding. The talks also cover food rules, carbon plans and other small‑scale deals that could be wrapped up quickly."
