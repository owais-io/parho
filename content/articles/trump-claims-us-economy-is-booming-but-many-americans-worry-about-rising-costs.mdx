title: "Trump claims U.S. economy is booming, but many Americans worry about rising costs"
summary: "Trump told a Detroit audience that the first year of his second term was the best ever, saying prices fell and growth jumped. He ignores data that shows inflation still high and the job market weak. Trump blames Biden for past problems, pushes for tariffs, and keeps attacking the Fed, even after a probe into the Fed chair. He promises new housing rules, credit‑card caps and drug‑price cuts to ease living costs, while polls show many Americans feel poorer."
