title: "Why Paying for Kidney Donors Won’t Fix the Shortage"
summary: "Many argue that allowing people to sell kidneys would shorten transplant wait times. Experts counter that the real issues are late diagnosis, unequal access, and a system that doesn’t support voluntary donors. Paying donors could also exploit those in financial need. The focus should be on prevention, better public awareness, and fair, voluntary donation programmes instead of creating a market."
