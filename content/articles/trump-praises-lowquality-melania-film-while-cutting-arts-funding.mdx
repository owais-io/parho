summary: "A new documentary about former first lady Melania Trump pulled in about $7 million in its opening weekend but critics say it’s a dull, poorly made movie. Despite its weak reception, Trump and his supporters went to the premiere and praised the film, even though he’s been slashing arts grants and closing venues like the Kennedy Center. The contrast between the movie’s success and his arts cuts fuels criticism."
