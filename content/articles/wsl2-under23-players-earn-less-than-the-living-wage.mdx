title: "WSL2 Under‑23 Players Earn Less Than the Living Wage"
summary: "WSL2 clubs have set a minimum salary for players aged 18‑22, but the pay is still below the UK’s living wage. For 18‑20‑year‑olds the floor is £17,500 a year, and £22,200 for 21‑22‑year‑olds. That falls short of the £23,810 a year that the living wage would give a 37.5‑hour worker. Many clubs pay more, but the rule means young footballers may still need part‑time jobs."
