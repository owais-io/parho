title: "BBC’s New Tennis “Battle of the Sexes” Is a Problematic Stunt"
summary: "The BBC plans to show a tennis match where top‑ranked woman Aryna Sabalenka will play against Aussie player Nick Kyrgios. They’ll tweak the rules – a smaller court for the woman and only one serve – to make it seem like a fair contest. The article argues this gimmick is sexist, will give bad men a platform, and risks making people doubt women’s tennis. It calls the event a waste and harmful to the sport."
