title: "OECD urges Australia to raise GST and boost affordable housing"
summary: "The OECD said Australia should raise the goods and services tax (GST), cut carbon emissions and build more social housing. It warned that high housing costs hurt families and workers and that Australia’s climate plans still need more work. The report suggests replacing stamp duties with a land tax, increasing public housing and using a higher GST to help balance the budget. The changes could grow the economy by about 1.6% over ten years."
