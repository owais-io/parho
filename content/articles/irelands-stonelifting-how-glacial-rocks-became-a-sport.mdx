title: "Ireland’s Stone‑Lifting: How Glacial Rocks Became a Sport"
summary: "The letter explains that Ireland’s ancient stone‑lifting competitions use boulders that are actually glacial erratics – rocks carried and smoothed by ice sheets. Their rounded edges come from being ground against other stones during transport. The writer also shares family history, noting a great‑great‑grandfather who worked as a ballast‑getter in 1861 London, linking hard physical labor to the sport’s origins. The piece highlights the natural and cultural roots of the activity."
