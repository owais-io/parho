title: "US Spent $32M to Deport 300 Migrants to Five Countries"
summary: "A Senate report says the Trump administration paid more than $32 million to send about 300 migrants to five foreign countries, many of them corrupt or hostile. The money covered flights and the host nations’ acceptance fees, but most people were quickly sent back to their own countries, wasting taxpayers’ dollars. The report also found little oversight on how the funds were spent."
