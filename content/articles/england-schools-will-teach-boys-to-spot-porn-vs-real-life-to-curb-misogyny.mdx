title: "England schools will teach boys to spot porn vs real life to curb misogyny"
summary: "England’s new plan will put classes in schools that help boys, starting at age 11, see the gap between porn and real relationships. It’s part of a £550 m effort to cut violence against women and girls. Teachers will also learn how to spot toxic behaviour, teach about consent, stalking and online harms like deepfakes. Critics say the money isn’t enough to help victims once they’re identified."
