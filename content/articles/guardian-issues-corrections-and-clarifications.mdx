title: "Guardian Issues Corrections and Clarifications"
summary: "Guardian’s corrections page clears up earlier reporting errors. It notes that a third of English GPs work outside NHS general practices, not in private practices. The Director of Public Prosecutions is actually the third‑ranked prosecutor, not the UK’s top. The page also corrects details in other stories—about a journalist’s death, an actor, an obituary, a poem, cancer facts, policing at a Muslim rally, a union’s cost, and how to file complaints."
