title: "Liverpool Tops Football Revenue List; No Premier League Club Makes Top Four"
summary: "Liverpool became the richest club in English football last season, topping Deloitte’s Money League with €836m in revenue. No Premier League team broke into the top four—a first in the report’s 29‑year history—because clubs like Manchester City and Manchester United fell behind in broadcast income and Champions League earnings. Liverpool’s climb was helped by strong on‑field results, Champions League money and extra events like Taylor Swift concerts at Anfield."
