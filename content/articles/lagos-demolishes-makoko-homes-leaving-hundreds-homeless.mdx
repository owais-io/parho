title: "Lagos demolishes Makoko homes, leaving hundreds homeless"
summary: "In December, Lagos police and bulldozers tore down houses in Makoko, an informal water‑based community. Residents were given little warning and no new homes. The government says it was a safety move because of a high‑voltage power line, but many say the demolitions were a human rights violation. People lost their homes, schools, fishing nets and livelihoods, and now many live on boats or in shelters with no clear resettlement plan."
