title: "Supreme Court Lets Texas Use New Republican‑Friendly Congressional Map"
summary: "The U.S. Supreme Court has approved Texas’s new congressional map, which could add up to five districts that favor Republicans. The 6‑3 conservative majority overrode a lower court that had said the map was racist and forced the state to use an older one. The three liberal justices disagreed, saying the lower court interfered with the election process. The decision could help Donald Trump’s party win more seats in next year’s midterms."
