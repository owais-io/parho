title: "Roasted Pumpkin & Pickled Walnut Salad"
summary: "Mark Hix, a Dorset gardener and chef, has been struggling to grow squash. A friend gave him fresh plants, and he’s now experimenting with new varieties. Squash is versatile – he’s made cheesecake, pumpkin pie, and even a cocktail. In this recipe he roasts orange squash, shaves some ribbons, and tosses them with salad leaves, pickled walnuts, tarragon, and a dressing of cider vinegar and walnut liquor. Sprinkle toasted pumpkin seeds on top for crunch."
