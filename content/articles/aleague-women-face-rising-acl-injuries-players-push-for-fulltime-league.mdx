title: "A‑League Women face rising ACL injuries; players push for full‑time league"
summary: "The A‑League Women have seen a spike in ACL tears this season, with seven players now injured. There’s no official injury tracker and most research focuses on men. Players say tight match dates, hot weather, long travel and part‑time jobs make injuries more likely. Because recovery can take a year, the players want the league to become full‑time so they get better support and research to stop future injuries."
