title: "Humans Are Changing How Eagles Behave"
summary: "Scientists fit tiny GPS tags on raptors and see how people affect them. The data shows eagles travel farther on holidays when more hikers are out, and they skip breeding sites that feel too crowded. Many die on power lines or wind turbines. In Spain, 33,000 raptors are killed each year by electricity pylons. Scientists say better planning, retrofitted pylons and smart wind‑farm sites can save birds."
