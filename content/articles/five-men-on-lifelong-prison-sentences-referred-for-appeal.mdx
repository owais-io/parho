title: "Five Men on Lifelong Prison Sentences Referred for Appeal"
summary: "The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has sent five men’s lifelong prison sentences for review. These sentences, given under the now‑scrapped Indefinite Prisoner for Public Protection (IPP) and its child version, were originally set when the men were very young. A recent court decision found that age and maturity were ignored. The CCRC says the same issue could apply to others still serving IPP or DPP terms and is ready to help."
