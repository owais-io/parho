title: "Should Resident Doctors Strike for Higher Wages?"
summary: "Retired NHS anaesthetist says resident doctors deserve to strike because they’re underpaid and work long, unsafe hours. He spent 40 years in the NHS, often clocking 80‑100 hours a week with little pay, food and accommodation. He thinks the government has ignored doctors’ hard work and that better pay would help keep people in the profession. Some senior consultants, however, say they’re happy with their pay and don’t support striking."
