title: "Higher CO₂ Makes Food Calorie‑Rich but Nutrient‑Poor"
summary: "Scientists found that as the air gets more carbon dioxide, foods like rice, wheat, tomatoes and potatoes gain calories but lose important nutrients. In a big study that looked at 60,000 data points, the researchers saw drops in zinc, iron and protein, and even a rise in lead. With CO₂ already higher than the “safe” level, this could mean more “hidden hunger” and health risks. The study urges a rethink of farming and diets."
