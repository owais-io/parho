title: "A Family’s Cricket Dream Built From One Willow Tree"
summary: "In Victoria’s Central Highlands, Ian Tinetti grew a cricket field from a single willow cutting that came from the 1902 Ashes Test. Over decades the grove produced the wood for bats used by Don Bradman’s team. The Tinetti family turned the farm into a self‑made cricket ground, a bat‑making workshop, and a gallery that celebrates Swiss‑Italian migrant history. Now the community visits for matches and tours, but the future depends on whether younger family members will keep the site alive."
