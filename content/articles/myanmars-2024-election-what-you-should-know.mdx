title: "Myanmar’s 2024 Election: What You Should Know"
summary: "Myanmar is holding national elections after the 2021 military coup. The junta says it’s returning to democracy, but many countries say the vote is a sham that keeps the generals in power through military‑backed parties. Voting starts December 28, with three phases planned. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party is dissolved and she’s jailed, so her name won’t appear. The polls happen amid a civil war, with arrests for protests and harsh penalties for critics. China backs the election; Western governments strongly oppose it."
