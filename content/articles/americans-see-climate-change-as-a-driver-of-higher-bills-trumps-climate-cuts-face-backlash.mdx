title: "Americans See Climate Change as a Driver of Higher Bills, Trump’s Climate Cuts Face Backlash"
summary: "A Yale poll found that 65 % of voters think the climate crisis is raising everyday costs, from higher food and energy bills to insurance hikes linked to extreme weather. Trump’s moves to shut down climate research, cut renewables and block wind farms are widely opposed—almost eight in ten reject his cuts. Most Americans see climate action as a way to lower costs, even though only about one‑fifth of conservatives support a climate‑focused candidate."
