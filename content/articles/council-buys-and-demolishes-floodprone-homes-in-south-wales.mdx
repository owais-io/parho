title: "Council Buys and Demolishes Flood‑Prone Homes in South Wales"
summary: "Rhondda Cynon Taf council is buying and demolishing 16 terraced houses on Clydach Terrace in Ynysybwl because they can’t be protected from flooding. The move will cost over £2.5 million and is the first time a UK authority has bought so many inland homes for flood‑relief. Residents, who have suffered repeated floods and high insurance costs after Storm Dennis, welcome the decision. A new wall was too expensive and would still not help, so the council will relocate people instead."
