title: "Trump Cuts Trans Health Care, Scientists Say Science Is Misused"
summary: "Scientists and health experts warn that the Trump administration’s new rules are shutting down gender‑affirming care for kids and adults. The Health and Human Services order would stop Medicaid and Medicare from covering puberty blockers, hormones and surgeries for anyone under 18, and it could also limit care in prisons. Researchers say this misuse of biology hurts trans patients and could lead to more mental health problems, and it may set a precedent for other medical restrictions."
