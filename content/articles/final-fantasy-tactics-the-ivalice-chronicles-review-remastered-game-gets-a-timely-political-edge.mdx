title: "Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Review – Remastered Game Gets a Timely Political Edge"
summary: "The 1997 RPG Final Fantasy Tactics has been remastered for today’s players. It follows noble Ramza as he fights a civil war, uncovering class struggles and power grabs. The story is straight‑forward, not player‑dependent, and the voice‑acted dialogue feels very dramatic. Turn‑based battles let you mix jobs like a creative deck of cards, while the game’s bleak political theme feels even more relevant now, showing that the old story still matters. The game sells for £39.99."
