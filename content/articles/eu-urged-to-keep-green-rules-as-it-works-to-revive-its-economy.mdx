title: "EU urged to keep green rules as it works to revive its economy"
summary: "EU leaders are being warned not to weaken the bloc’s green rules while they try to revive a struggling economy. NGOs say energy‑intensive industries suffer from high fuel prices and market forces, not from climate policy. The EU’s economy has been hit by US tariffs and slow implementation of reforms, so the Commission is balancing new deregulation with a push for clean‑tech investment and a “buy European” preference."
