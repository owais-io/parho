title: "UK schools must build special rooms for students with extra needs"
summary: "UK schools must now set up “inclusion bases” – special rooms or spaces – for children with neurodiverse and SEND needs. The move is part of a £3.7bn push to give up to 60,000 new places in mainstream schools, plus a £700m repair fund to fix old buildings. Teachers say the plan could improve learning and safety, but schools also need clear rules, staff and training to make it work."
