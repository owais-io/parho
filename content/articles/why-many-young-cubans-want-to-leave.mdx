title: "**Why many young Cubans want to leave**"
summary: "People in Cuba today face many problems. Food is scarce. Electricity is often missing. Work is hard to find. These problems make many young people think: “I want to leave.” --- ### 1.  The economy is in trouble Cuba’s economy has suffered for years. The United States has put a long‑time embargo on Cuba.   Because of the embargo, Cuba cannot buy many goods from other countries.   Cuba also lost its Soviet Union friend after 1991. Now the country can make only a few jobs.   Most people feel the money they earn is not enough for food or medicine. --- ### 2.  The people have lost faith in the system The Cuban Communist Party runs the country. Some people say it should keep working.   Others think the party is too old and should change.   In July 2021, many people marched in the streets (the 11J protests).   The government stopped some reforms and imprisoned many protestors.   Human Rights Watch says over 700 people have been jailed for protesting. --- ### 3.  Climate and weather add danger Cuba is a small island. It can make only a small part of the world’s carbon.   Still, it can be hit by hurricanes. Hurricane Melissa hit 3 million people.   The country is still weak on food, medicine and power.   If another storm hits, problems will grow. --- ### 4.  Why young people leave Most young people want a better life. They do not always care if the government changes.   They want freedom, a decent job, and good health.   They feel the present system is unfair.   So they try to leave Cuba. Many go to places like Russia, Nicaragua, Mexico, or the United States. --- ### 5.  Life after leaving People who have left now can talk freely.   They say the protests showed how tough life is.   Leaving is not a political statement for them.   They simply want a better future.   Most say: “I would not go back to Cuba unless it becomes a true democracy.” --- **Key takeaway** - Cuba is facing economic and social problems. - Young people feel hope is low. - Many want to leave, hoping for a safer, better life. - They are not necessarily against the idea of democracy, but they feel that the present system cannot change itself."
