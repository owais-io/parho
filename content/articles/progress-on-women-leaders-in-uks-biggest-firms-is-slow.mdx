title: "Progress on women leaders in UK’s biggest firms is slow"
summary: "A new report shows that progress on putting more women into top jobs at Britain’s biggest companies has been slow. Only 10 out of 100 FTSE‑100 firms had a woman CEO last year, and the number of women in chief financial officer, chair and CEO roles is still very low. Even though women hold about half of board seats, they are under‑represented in senior executive teams. The government says it will push harder with new laws and better maternity protection."
