title: "Heavy Snow Hits U.S. States, Delays Denver Flights; Winter Storms Continue"
summary: "A cold spell kept parts of the U.S. covered in snow, with 20‑30 cm falling in Wisconsin and up to 30 cm in Colorado. Denver saw its first heavy snow, delaying about 1,000 flights. Fog made things worse in northern Colorado. Another storm will hit the Rockies this weekend, bringing blizzard‑like drifting snow. Meanwhile, the U.S. stays abnormally cold, while Australia’s south sees freezing mountain snow and the west faces a 40 °C heatwave, raising fire risks."
