title: "Online wellness sites let shoppers buy unapproved peptides without seeing a doctor"
summary: "Some Australian online wellness sites let shoppers browse and add experimental peptides—like MOTS‑c, BPC‑157 and NAD+—to their cart before even talking to a doctor. The products aren’t approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, but the clinics say they’ll still send a doctor’s prescription after the purchase. Health regulators worry the practice bypasses proper medical review and could promote unsafe drugs. Guardian Australia looked at three such sites and found similar concerns."
