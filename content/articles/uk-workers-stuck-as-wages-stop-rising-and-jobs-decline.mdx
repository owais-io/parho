title: "UK workers stuck as wages stop rising and jobs decline"
summary: "In December, private‑sector pay rose only 3.4%, the same as inflation, meaning workers’ real earnings are flat. Confidence is low, and unemployment hit a five‑year high of 5.2%. Firms are holding back hiring, while the Bank of England left rates unchanged at 3.75% to curb inflation. Mortgage costs have jumped, adding to household strain. Some signs of job gains hint the outlook could improve if inflation eases and rates fall."
