title: "Adani Donated Over $600,000 to Queensland Party Using Federal Loophole"
summary: "Adani, the mining giant, gave the Queensland Liberal National Party more than $600,000 just before the 2024 state election. The money was sent in large chunks through federal rules that let donors hide the donation for weeks. Queensland law, which says donations must be posted right away, wasn’t triggered because the money was marked as “federal purpose.” The Greens say this kept voters in the dark and want stricter rules. New laws will tighten disclosure."
