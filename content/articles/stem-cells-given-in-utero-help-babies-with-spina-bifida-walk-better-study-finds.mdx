title: "Stem Cells Given In Utero Help Babies With Spina Bifida Walk Better, Study Finds"
summary: "A small U.S. trial showed that putting placenta‑derived stem cells on the spina bifida‑affected spine during fetal surgery is safe and improves babies’ mobility and quality of life. Six unborn children were treated while still in the womb, and afterward they had less brain‑folding problems and better movement. Researchers say the results could make this approach a standard before birth."
