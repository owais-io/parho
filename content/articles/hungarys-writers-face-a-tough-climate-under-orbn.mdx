title: "Hungary’s Writers Face a Tough Climate Under Orbán"
summary: "Hungarian writer László Krasznahorkai won the Nobel Prize, but many writers now leave the country because of Viktor Orbán’s tightening control over books, media, and culture. The government funds right‑wing authors, censors LGBTQ content, and buys big publishers. Small independent outlets struggle, and young writers find it hard to earn a living. While the town of Gyula celebrates the Nobel, writers say life in Hungary has become difficult."
