title: "Schools Can Now Change Pronouns for Primary Students Who Question Their Gender"
summary: "The UK government has released guidance that lets primary schools use different pronouns for kids who question their gender, but only with parents’ and medical advice. The rules say teachers shouldn’t change a child’s name or pronoun on their own, and social transitioning is expected to be rare for young pupils. Schools must keep children safe, keep single‑sex spaces, and consult parents before making any changes."
