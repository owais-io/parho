title: "EU Plan to Boost Deportations Draws Rights Group Backlash"
summary: "Over 70 rights groups say the EU's new deportation rules could turn everyday places into immigration police stations, risking racism and fear. The plan would let police search homes without a court order, send people to offshore camps, and make public services report migrants. It could stop vulnerable people from getting health care and other help. Human rights experts warn it violates international rules and fuels far‑right hate."
