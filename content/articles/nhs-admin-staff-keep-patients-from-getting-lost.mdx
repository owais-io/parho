title: "NHS admin staff keep patients from getting lost"
summary: "About one in seven GP referrals in England disappear, harming patients, and hospital patients face similar gaps. Doctors and nurses have to add extra paperwork because the system doesn’t track appointments and cancellations well. The admin workers themselves are capable and dedicated, but the whole process isn’t managed properly. Better coordination and clear accountability are needed, or staff will keep taking on admin overload, increasing stress and burnout."
