title: "England Cuts Goals for Accessible New Homes, Disappointing Disabled People"
summary: "England’s government has lowered its target for new homes to include basic accessibility features to only 40% and removed any requirement for wheelchair‑friendly homes. Disability groups say this move betrays disabled people and reduces the hard‑won progress made under the previous government’s 100% M4(2) and 10% M4(3) plan. Local councils already set higher targets, but overall access to fully adaptable homes remains low."
