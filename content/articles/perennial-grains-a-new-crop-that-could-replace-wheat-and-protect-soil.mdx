title: "Perennial Grains: A New Crop That Could Replace Wheat and Protect Soil"
summary: "Scientists in Kansas are breeding a new grain called Kernza that lives for years instead of being planted each season. Because it keeps its roots in the ground, it protects soil, uses less water, fertilizer and pesticide, and stores more carbon. Kernza currently yields less than wheat but researchers hope to catch up in 10‑15 years. Farmers, big food companies and researchers worldwide are now testing and buying the crop, hoping it can feed people while healing the earth."
