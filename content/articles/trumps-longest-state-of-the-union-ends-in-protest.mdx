title: "Trump’s Longest State of the Union Ends in Protest"
summary: "Trump’s 107‑minute State of the Union was the longest in U.S. history, but it offered little new policy. He repeated familiar promises about jobs and lower prices while repeating divisive rhetoric on race and immigration. A lone Texas congressman held a sign saying “Black people aren’t apes!” and stayed in the chamber despite attempts to remove him. Democrats largely sat in silence or walked out, and the speech was widely seen as empty and polarising."
