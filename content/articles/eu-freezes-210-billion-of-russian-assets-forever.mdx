title: "EU freezes €210 billion of Russian assets forever"
summary: "The EU has used emergency powers to freeze €210 billion of Russian central‑bank assets for good. Moscow has threatened retaliation and sued Euroclear, the Brussels depository that holds the money. The frozen funds are meant to help pay for Ukraine’s defence. Some members, especially Belgium, worry about legal risks and want EU leaders alone to decide how to use the money. A summit next week will set the final plan."
