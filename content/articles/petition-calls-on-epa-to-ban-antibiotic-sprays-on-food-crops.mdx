title: "Petition Calls on EPA to Ban Antibiotic Sprays on Food Crops"
summary: "A coalition of health and farm‑worker groups has asked the EPA to stop allowing farms to spray antibiotics on fruits and vegetables. They say the practice fuels drug‑resistant bacteria, endangers workers, and can harm consumers and the environment. Studies link pesticide‑use antibiotics to health risks, and the groups warn this could create more serious infections than crop damage."
