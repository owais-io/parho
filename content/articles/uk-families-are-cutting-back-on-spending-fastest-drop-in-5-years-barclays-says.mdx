title: "UK families are cutting back on spending – fastest drop in 5 years, Barclays says"
summary: "Barclays found UK households spent less in November than in any month since 2019, with card payments down 1.1% year‑on‑year. Black Friday still drew the most shoppers, but the usual boost was smaller because people are nervous about the budget. Food sales rose 3%, but other goods barely moved. Retailers and pubs feel the hit, while streaming and travel bookings grew. Barclays warns that a weaker economy may keep spending low into 2026."
