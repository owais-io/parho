title: "FBI raid on Georgia election office fuels Trump’s fraud claims"
summary: "The FBI raided the Fulton County election office in Georgia, seizing 2020 ballots, voting tapes and voter rolls. The move is part of Donald Trump’s push to repeat the false story that the 2020 election was stolen. Giuliani had already paid a settlement for spreading lies. Courts have dismissed most of the legal challenges, and county officials say the raid took control of records they can’t access anymore. Trump’s allies use the raid to spread doubt before the 2026 mid‑terms."
