summary: "Scientists say that for most of the world, you can grow the economy and still lower or keep carbon emissions flat. Since 2015, 92% of global GDP has shown this “decoupling” – growth without extra emissions – especially in countries like Brazil, Colombia and Egypt. China’s emissions have stopped rising, and the US, EU, and several other nations have kept shrinking their carbon footprint while expanding their economies. Still, experts urge faster action to hit climate goals."
