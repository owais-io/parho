title: "Many Australians Miss Palliative Care at End of Life"
summary: "An Australian friend lost her mother three days after learning about palliative care. The story shows many people, especially those with dementia or organ failure, never get early palliative care. While 60 % of cancer patients receive it, only 28 % of organ‑failure patients and 22 % of dementia patients do. Late referrals lead to costly, uncomfortable hospital stays. Better funding, awareness, and early access could ease suffering and save money."
