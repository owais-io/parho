title: "Africa Cup of Nations 2027 May Be Postponed to 2028"
summary: "The Confederation of African Football (CAF) is considering moving the 2027 Africa Cup of Nations from its planned hosts—Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda—to 2028. Organisers are worried the three countries don’t have enough stadiums, security or ticketing systems to handle 24 teams in 10 cities. A delay would cancel the 2028 edition and push the new four‑year cycle to 2029, where CAF hopes to launch a new African Nations League."
