title: "Trump’s Visit to Davos Signals Trouble for the Global Rules System"
summary: "The World Economic Forum in Davos tried to make room for Donald Trump, who doesn’t like free trade or climate action and favors power over talk. His presence shows that the old post‑war rules—set up by the U.S. and Europe—are failing. Big countries like China, India and Brazil want a fairer system, but the U.S. still controls key institutions. The article argues the rules need major reform to work in today’s world."
