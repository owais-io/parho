title: "Trump’s moves could keep him in power or turn the U.S. into a rogue state"
summary: "Experts say Trump’s recent actions—cutting aid, seizing Venezuelan oil, and abandoning the UN—show a shift toward power‑first politics that may erode U.S. democracy. Peter Trubowitz notes the administration is unpredictable and regionally focused, especially in the Western Hemisphere. He warns that damage to institutions could be permanent, and that other countries may soon have to reckon with a U.S. that behaves more like a rogue state than a respected democracy."
