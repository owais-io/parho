title: "Canada in Record Cold, US Records Warmest Christmas"
summary: "Canada is in a deep freeze, with temperatures as low as -55°C in the Yukon. Over Christmas, many Canadian cities had sub‑zero lows, while the power grid is strained. At the same time, parts of the US had the hottest Christmas on record, with some places feeling like spring. The heat is caused by a big high‑pressure area, and the cold will stay until early next year."
