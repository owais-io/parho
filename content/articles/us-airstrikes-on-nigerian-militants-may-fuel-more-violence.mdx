title: "US airstrikes on Nigerian militants may fuel more violence"
summary: "U.S. airstrikes hit Islamic State camps in Nigeria’s Sokoto state. Nigerians liked the hits, but many are confused about why the U.S. said it was fighting a “Christian genocide.” In reality the strikes were against jihadists, not the herder groups that attack Christians. Nigeria’s leaders said the operation was approved. There were no reported civilian deaths, but the campaign might give extremists propaganda and won’t solve the deeper problems that fuel violence."
