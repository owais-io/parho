title: "Amsterdam to Ban Fatbikes From City Parks After Accident Surge"
summary: "Amsterdam is planning to ban heavy, electric “fatbikes” from its parks because accidents have risen sharply, especially among children. Riders can tweak the bikes to reach 25 mph, even though they’re meant to stay below 15 mph. Safety groups say 5,000 riders go to hospital each year, and many parents fear their kids can’t safely use them. While some riders oppose the ban, officials say it’s a necessary step to protect pedestrians and cyclists."
