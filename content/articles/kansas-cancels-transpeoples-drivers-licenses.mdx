title: "Kansas Cancels Transpeople's Driver’s Licenses"
summary: "Kansas has passed a new law that forces transgender residents to change their driver's licenses so they show the sex they were born with. The bill also bars trans people from using bathrooms that match their gender and lets citizens sue anyone who does for $1,000. Passed quickly by a Republican majority, the law overrides the governor’s veto. Transgender Kansans receive letters telling them to surrender their licenses by Thursday, with no grace period. Many fear the bill will be challenged in court."
