title: "Cheap car‑insurance ads may be fake scams"
summary: "Many people see social‑media ads that promise very low car‑insurance prices. These “ghost brokers” actually give you a fake certificate, leaving you uninsured. Young drivers, who already pay high rates, are the main targets. If the police stop you or you’re in an accident, you could be fined or lose your licence. Watch out for low‑price ads, check the broker is FCA‑registered, and report any scam to the Insurance Fraud Bureau or Action Fraud."
