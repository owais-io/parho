title: "Sydney May Hold 26 January Protests Even If New Restrictions Stay"
summary: "Police in Sydney say major protests on Australia Day could still go ahead, even if a new restriction on protests stays in place. The restriction, which was extended after a terror attack at Bondi, stops certain protest forms that help protect demonstrators from arrest. Police say they are working with organizers to plan for different situations. Groups plan rallies for Invasion Day, anti‑war, and other causes, and the city will watch how the laws affect these events."
