title: "Farmers Turn Wetland into Eco‑Friendly Farm"
summary: "Farmers in Somerset Levels have started growing bulrush, a plant that thrives in wet soil, instead of draining the land. The new technique, called paludiculture, keeps the marshy ground moist, reducing carbon release. After seeding, the bulrush is cut and its fluffy seed heads are turned into BioPuff, a natural insulation for jackets. The method shows how to use wetland plants for eco‑friendly products while protecting the environment."
