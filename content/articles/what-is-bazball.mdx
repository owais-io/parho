title: "**What is “Bazball”?**"
summary: "Bazball is a way England’s cricket team plays.   It is very fast and very loud. * The batters hit many big shots.   * They try to score runs quickly.   * They keep the ball going without many stops.   * They try to win games in a short time. Think of it like a sprint in a race instead of a slow walk.   Bazball is about having a lot of fun, taking risks, and finishing games fast."
