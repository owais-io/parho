title: "England’s cricket story is long."
summary: "Cricket started in England over 200 years ago.   The Ashes is a series of five long games called Test matches.   Australia won most of the time, but England can still win.   England is good at running a big chase.   In 2022 they chased 378 against India.   They chased 373 at Headingley this summer.   That shows they can hit many runs when it matters.   The big Australian score they face is about 400.   It’s a tough job, but not impossible.   If England fails this time, the next step is to look at county cricket again.   They will try to change how the counties are run to help England next time.   So, yes, England has a chance.   They need to keep their focus and use their best bowlers.   Hope is still in the air."
