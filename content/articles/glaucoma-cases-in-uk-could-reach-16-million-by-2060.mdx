title: "Glaucoma cases in UK could reach 1.6 million by 2060"
summary: "Researchers say that by 2060, 1.6 million people in Britain could be living with glaucoma, the main cause of permanent blindness. The rise comes from an ageing population and a growing number of high‑risk ethnic groups. Most people don’t notice symptoms until the disease is advanced, so the study urges yearly eye checks for adults over 40 and bigger eye‑care services. Early detection and treatment could prevent most vision loss."
