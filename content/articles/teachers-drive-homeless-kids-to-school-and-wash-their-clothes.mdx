title: "Teachers Drive Homeless Kids to School and Wash Their Clothes"
summary: "A survey of 11,000 teachers found that schools regularly help children in temporary homes. About half of teachers say they send families to food banks, 41% help kids get to class, and a quarter wash uniforms for those without laundry facilities. The work shows the big impact of homelessness on attendance, grades and health. Experts say the government must build more affordable homes to stop this cycle."
