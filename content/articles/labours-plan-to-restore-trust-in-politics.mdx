title: "Labour’s Plan to Restore Trust in Politics"
summary: "The Transparency International report shows Britain has slipped to 20th in corruption, the worst in history. Scandals like Peter Mandelson and the “buy‑in” of politicians to private firms have hurt public trust. Labour leader Keir Starmer promises to clean up politics, but the reforms in the election bill are seen as weak. The biggest change people want is cutting the money that big donors give to parties."
