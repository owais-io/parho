title: "Australia’s Liberal Party Needs a New Economic Plan to Win Voters"
summary: "Australia’s Liberal Party has drifted from its strong economic focus, becoming too similar to the Nationals and losing appeal in cities. Polls show only a handful of urban seats, and voters are moving to the right‑wing One Nation party over concerns about jobs, housing and wages. To win back voters, the Liberals need a clear economic reform plan, united messaging, and a new promise of hope for everyday Australians."
