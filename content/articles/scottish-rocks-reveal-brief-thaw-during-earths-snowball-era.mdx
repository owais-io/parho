title: "Scottish rocks reveal brief thaw during Earth's “snowball” era"
summary: "In a study of layers in rocks from Scotland’s remote islands, scientists found evidence that the planet’s “snowball Earth”—a time about 700 million years ago when it was thought to have been completely frozen—experienced a brief thaw. By looking at 2,600 layers under a microscope, researchers spotted tiny climate changes that match today’s solar and El Niño cycles. The data suggest a few thousand‑year slushy period when some ocean water melted, showing Earth’s climate can still react to extreme shifts."
