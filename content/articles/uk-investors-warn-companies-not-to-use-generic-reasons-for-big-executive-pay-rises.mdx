title: "UK investors warn companies not to use generic reasons for big executive pay rises"
summary: "The Investment Association says companies shouldn’t rely on generic “benchmarking” to justify large executive pay hikes. They want clear evidence that higher pay is linked to better performance and shareholder value. The warning comes as the London Stock Exchange’s CEO saw his pay jump to £7.9 m in 2024, and FTSE 100 chief executives saw a 11 % rise last year. Investors want stronger accountability."
