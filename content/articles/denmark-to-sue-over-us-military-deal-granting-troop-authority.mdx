title: "Denmark to Sue Over US Military Deal Granting Troop Authority"
summary: "Denmark passed a defense deal that lets US troops operate freely on Danish soil, giving them control over local civilians and access to airbases. An MP says it violates the Danish constitution and will sue the state. The agreement was approved last year but raises concerns about sovereignty and accountability, especially after US talk of Greenland. Denmark’s government says it keeps ties with the US and supports Ukraine aid. Legal action could force a review of the deal."
