title: "US raid on Venezuela raises questions about China’s plans for Taiwan"
summary: "The US surprised everyone by raiding Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and taking him to the U.S. The move made Chinese officials think about what an attack on Taiwan might look like, even though Taiwan is a self‑governed island and China says it’s a domestic issue. Taiwan’s leaders point out they have U.S. backing, and the raid shows that even powerful weapons can be breached. China protested the raid but said it doesn’t change its plans for Taiwan."
