title: "NHS introduces a warning system to catch unsafe maternity care"
summary: "NHS England has launched a new “Moss” system that watches for higher-than‑expected deaths and serious injuries in maternity wards. It compares each unit’s data with others in real time and sends alerts when the chance of bad care is 95% or 99% certain. If an alert fires, the ward must investigate within eight days and the trust’s top leaders sign off the fixes. Moss is now active in all 119 NHS maternity units, aiming to stop preventable harm."
