title: "Russia keeps buying Michelin airplane tires even though sanctions forbid it"
summary: "Despite the EU and UK banning sales of airplane tires to Russia, customs data shows the country is still getting Michelin tires through middlemen. In 2023, $28m worth arrived, and in 2024 an extra $7m was sent by companies in Turkey, Spain, Saudi Arabia, India, and a UK‑based firm that isn’t officially registered. Michelin says it has stopped all business in Russia and is tightening its sanctions checks, but critics say its safeguards are not enough."
