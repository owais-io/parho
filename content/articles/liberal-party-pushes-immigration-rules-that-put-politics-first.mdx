title: "Liberal Party Pushes Immigration Rules That Put Politics First"
summary: "The Liberal Party, led by Tony Abbott and Angus Taylor, wants to tighten immigration by adding a test on ‘Australian values’. They propose banning migrants from certain countries and canceling visas for people who don’t live up to these values, even if they haven’t broken the current character test. The plan would be costly, slow the visa system, and could send people back to dangerous places. It risks harming Australia’s multicultural society and its own values of fairness and tolerance."
