title: "Bond markets could force Rachel Reeves to issue a new budget"
summary: "Bond investors warn that if the UK budget disappoints them, interest rates on government bonds could rise sharply. That would push Chancellor Rachel Reeves to deliver a second budget to keep borrowing costs low. The danger is 10‑year and 30‑year yields could hit unsustainable levels, especially if no spending cuts or real tax hikes are announced. Investors want more fiscal space—at least £20 bn—to steady the market."
