title: "U.S. Investigates Claim Meta Can Read WhatsApp Messages"
summary: "U.S. officials are looking into a lawsuit that says Meta, the owner of WhatsApp, can read users’ supposedly private encrypted messages. The suit, filed by Quinn Emanuel, alleges that Meta can access all WhatsApp chats, a claim the company calls false. Meta also says the lawsuit is tied to spyware firm NSO Group, which recently lost a case against WhatsApp. Experts say end‑to‑end encryption makes such reading impossible, and the Commerce Department says there’s no proof of a breach."
