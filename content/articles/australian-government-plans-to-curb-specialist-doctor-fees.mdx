title: "Australian government plans to curb specialist doctor fees"
summary: "Australia’s health minister, Mark Butler, is set to tackle specialist doctor fees that are climbing too fast. He will publish each specialist’s average cost so patients can compare prices, and may use laws to cap fees. The plan also includes training more specialists where they’re needed and linking funding to meeting those targets. Doctors and patient groups back the move, but some say Medicare and hospital budgets are also to blame."
