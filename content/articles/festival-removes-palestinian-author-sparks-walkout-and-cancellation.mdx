title: "Festival removes Palestinian author, sparks walkout and cancellation"
summary: "An Adelaide writers festival removed Palestinian author Randa Abdel‑Fattah from its lineup after the 2023 Bondi shooting, saying it was a cultural‑sensitivity issue. The decision caused a backlash: more than 180 speakers withdrew, the board and director stepped down, and the 2026 festival was cancelled. Famous writers such as Zadie Smith and former New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern left the program, and Abdel‑Fattah accused the board of anti‑Palestinian racism. The festival, a cultural event, was shut down amid controversy."
