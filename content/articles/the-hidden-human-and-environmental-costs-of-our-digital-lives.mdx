title: "The Hidden Human and Environmental Costs of Our Digital Lives"
summary: "People in rural India work from home, watching hours of violent and pornographic content to help train AI for big tech. They suffer emotional trauma. Meanwhile, electronics production and disposal hurt the planet: mining cobalt in Africa, lithium in Chile, and 62 million tonnes of e‑waste each year pollute developing countries. AI also uses huge amounts of water, with predictions that usage could rise from 1.1 bn to 6.6 bn cubic metres by 2027. We must recognise and tackle these hidden costs."
