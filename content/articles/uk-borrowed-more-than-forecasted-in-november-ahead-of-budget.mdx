title: "UK Borrowed More Than Forecasted in November Ahead of Budget"
summary: "Public sector borrowing reached £11.7bn in November, higher than expected. The figure is the lowest November borrowing in four years, but the yearly total is still high. It shows the budget will need to cut the deficit sharply. It comes just before Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her autumn budget. The Bank of England lowered rates again, while the economy slowed. Critics say the government is piling up debt, and the budget may miss official forecasts."
