title: "Building 1.2 Million Homes Won’t Fix Australia’s Housing Affordability"
summary: "A new study shows that even a massive effort to build 1.2 million homes in the next five years would only bring a small drop in house‑price ratios, from 8.0 to 6.7 nationwide and from 12 to 10 in Sydney. The problem isn’t the lack of houses; it’s how money, taxes, and borrowing make buying a home still too expensive. The report argues that policies must focus on who gets the new homes and how taxes influence demand, not just on building more."
