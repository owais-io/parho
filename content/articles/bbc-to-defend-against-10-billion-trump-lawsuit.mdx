title: "BBC to Defend Against $10 Billion Trump Lawsuit"
summary: "Donald Trump has sued the BBC for $10 billion, claiming the broadcaster defamed him by cutting his 6 January speech in a Panorama programme. The BBC says it will fight the case and has already apologised for an editing error, but insists there is no legal basis for defamation. Two senior BBC chiefs resigned last month over the controversy. UK politicians back the BBC, and some experts think the case will probably settle for a much smaller amount."
