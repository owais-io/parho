title: "UK keeps fuel duty steady, plans new 3p‑per‑mile fee for electric cars"
summary: "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said fuel duty will stay the same until September 2026, but the 5p cut that Rishi Sunak added will be taken away later that year. She also confirmed a new charge of 3p per mile for fully electric cars from 2028, plus 1.5p for plug‑in hybrids. The plan will fund road upkeep and encourage EV use, but it could slow electric car sales a bit. The freeze will cost the Treasury about £2.4 billion next year."
