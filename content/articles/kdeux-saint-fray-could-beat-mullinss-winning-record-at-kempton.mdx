title: "Kdeux Saint Fray Could Beat Mullins’s Winning Record at Kempton"
summary: "In the upcoming Ladbrokes Trophy Handicap Chase at Kempton, trainer Emmet Mullins will field two horses in a 13‑runner field. Mullins has won 3 of his 5 Kempton rides, and the race could offer big money on the relatively untested Kdeux Saint Fray, who is stepping up to three miles for the first time. Other possible winners include Rising Dust, Chance Another One, Katate Dori, and Hoe Joly Smoke, but Kdeux Saint Fray at 7‑1 odds looks most promising."
