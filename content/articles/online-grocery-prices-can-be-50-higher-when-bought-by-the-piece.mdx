title: "Online Grocery Prices Can Be 50% Higher When Bought by the Piece"
summary: "Supermarkets now price fresh fruit and veg online by the piece instead of by weight, which can make prices jump wildly—sometimes 50 % higher. A Sydney analyst compared online per‑piece prices to the in‑store kilo price for 15 items and found the differences arbitrary, calling it a “capsicum paradox.” Because shoppers can’t see a per‑kilo price or average weight, they can’t know if they’re getting a good deal. The ACCC says retailers should show unit prices, but it’s not required."
