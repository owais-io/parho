title: "Mental‑health bed shortage contributed to UK teen’s death"
summary: "An inquest in West Sussex found that a shortage of mental‑health beds and poor communication between hospital and NHS staff caused the death of 16‑year‑old Ellame Ford‑Dunn. She left an acute children’s ward multiple times and was never quickly found. The jury said putting her in a non‑specialist ward was inappropriate and that the lack of beds and unclear procedures contributed to her death.
