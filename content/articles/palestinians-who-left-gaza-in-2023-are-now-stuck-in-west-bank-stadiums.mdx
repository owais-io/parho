title: "Palestinians Who Left Gaza in 2023 Are Now Stuck in West Bank Stadiums"
summary: "After Hamas’s attack on 7 Oct 2023, Israeli forces rounded up many Palestinian workers who had been in Israel for jobs. Most fled to the West Bank, ending up in stadiums turned into makeshift camps, like the one in Nablus. They live in cramped, dusty rooms, receiving small cash payments that barely reach families back in Gaza. Their loved ones are still in the strip, many dead, and they can’t return or leave. The situation leaves them in a limbo of exile and war."
