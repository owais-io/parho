title: "UK MPs Accuse Student Loans of Scamming Graduates"
summary: "Backbench Labour MPs have blasted the UK student loan system, saying it scams graduates. They are furious because a plan 2 loan—taken by 5.8 million students—keeps growing as interest adds up while repayments are tied to earnings. The dispute was sparked by a decision to freeze the repayment threshold for three years. MPs want the system fixed, while the government says it is reviewing the scheme and protecting taxpayers."
