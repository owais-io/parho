title: "MPs Slam DWP Over Carer Allowance Scandal"
summary: "MPs slammed senior DWP officials, especially Sir Peter Schofield, for their conduct during the carer allowance scandal that left many unpaid carers with huge debts. A select committee said the department’s culture and competence were unacceptable. The review found systemic failures, wrong benefit rules and unlawful guidance that pushed carers into debt, despair and even suicide thoughts. DWP apologised, promised changes, and is re‑examining 200,000 cases, with 26,000 debts likely to be cancelled or reduced."
