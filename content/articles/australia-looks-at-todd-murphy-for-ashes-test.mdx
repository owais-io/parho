title: "Australia Looks at Todd Murphy for Ashes Test"
summary: "Australia is thinking about picking spin bowler Todd Murphy for an upcoming Ashes Test after Nathan Lyon’s injury. Murphy, who has a quiet style and played well in India, could replace Lyon as the main spinner. The selectors are also debating whether to field an all‑pace attack, which has worked in some recent Tests. England’s bowlers struggled before, and a new spin threat could change the game. The match will still draw large crowds."
