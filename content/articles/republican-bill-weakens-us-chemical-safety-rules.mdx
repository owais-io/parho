title: "Republican Bill Weakens U.S. Chemical Safety Rules"
summary: "A new House bill from GOP lawmakers would roll back many protections in the Toxic Substances Control Act, the law that sets safety standards for chemicals. It would give industry more say in reviewing new chemicals, lower the bar for what counts as a risk, and let companies sue the EPA earlier. Advocates fear the changes could let dangerous substances reach markets and reduce worker safety."
