title: "Andrew Gwynne’s Pension Deal Opens Door for Andy Burnham to Return to Parliament"
summary: "Andrew Gwynne has agreed with the Commons pension committee to retire on medical grounds, a move that could trigger a byelection in his Gorton and Denton seat. Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, may use that election to return to Parliament and challenge Labour leader Keir Starmer. Gwynne, who is suspended and under investigation, says he never agreed to a deal with Burnham. A byelection would cost the party millions and could see Reform UK fight back."
