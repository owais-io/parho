title: "Animal Testing Still Needed for Medical Research"
summary: "The writer supports developing animal‑free methods, but says we still need animals for complex medical research. New approaches like organoids can’t fully replace real biology, especially for the brain, immune system and cancer. They also rely on animal‑derived ingredients. Cutting animal work would hurt skilled technicians and UK science. More money could help speed alternatives, but animal testing will remain necessary for now."
