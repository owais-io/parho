title: "NSW Parliament rushes new anti‑protest laws that may fail in court"
summary: "NSW Parliament has rushed new anti‑protest laws that let police restrict gatherings after a suspected terror incident. While the rules don’t ban protests outright, they make it hard for organisers to get official approval, and non‑compliant crowds can be fined. Previous laws faced court defeats for over‑broad restrictions on free speech. Activists plan to challenge this one too, arguing it could cover huge areas and chill political expression. The government is hoping stronger scrutiny will make the bills survive."
