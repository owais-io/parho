title: "Driving examiners quitting leaves test waiting times long"
summary: "Driving examiners are leaving the DVSA job at a fast clip, pushing the average wait for a practical driving test up to 22 weeks. Despite government promises to cut waiting times to seven weeks by year‑end, the plan won’t be met until November 2027. Ex‑examiners say low pay (max £30,000) and a difficult schedule drive them away. Instructors earn more and have better flexibility, so they’re pulling the talent away."
