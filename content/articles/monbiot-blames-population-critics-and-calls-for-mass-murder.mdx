title: "Monbiot Blames Population Critics and Calls for “Mass Murder”"
summary: "George Monbiot has called people worried about the world's growing population—about 70 million new people a year—“obsessives.” He says they’re hypocritical and racist, blaming poor Black and Brown people in the Global South while ignoring how much rich countries like the UK consume. Monbiot also says only “mass murder” could curb growth, dismissing family‑planning as murder. He ignores climate science that links population and consumption to CO2."
