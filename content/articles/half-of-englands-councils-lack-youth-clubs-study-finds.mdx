title: "Half of England’s councils lack youth clubs, study finds"
summary: "A recent study shows that about half of England’s local councils have neighbourhoods with almost no youth clubs, even though young people need support. The biggest gaps are in the north, where cuts since 2010 have left many youngsters without a place to meet or learn. While the government pledged £500m to rebuild youth centres, the drop in council spending and the shift to charities mean many gaps will only be filled if funding is used wisely and locally."
