title: "Celtic’s New Manager Wilfried Nancy Uses a Venn Diagram to Focus on What He Can Control"
summary: "Celtic’s new coach Wilfried Nancy drew a Venn diagram showing “things that matter” and “things you can control”. Critics say he’s been unlucky and that his tactics don’t fit the squad, but the author argues managers should focus on what they can actually influence rather than just public perception. Nancy’s win‑rate is low and fans want him to use the diagram to pick up the team’s performance."
