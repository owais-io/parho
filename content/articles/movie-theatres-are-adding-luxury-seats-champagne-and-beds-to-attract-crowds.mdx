title: "Movie theatres are adding luxury seats, champagne and beds to attract crowds"
summary: "Cinemas are pouring money into fancy upgrades—like reclining seats with built‑in chillers, private pod suites and even beds—to lure people back after the pandemic slump. Chains such as Vue and Odeon offer seats that cost £10‑£35, while Everyman’s cosy sofas and food service have become hugely popular. Though overall admissions are still below pre‑COVID levels and costs are high, the industry expects a boost from big‑screen releases in 2025 and beyond, helping bring movie‑goers back."
