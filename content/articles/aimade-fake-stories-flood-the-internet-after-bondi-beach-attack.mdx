summary: "After the Bondi Beach terror attack, a wave of AI‑generated fake news spread online. False claims said the attack was a false‑flag psyop, that the killers were IDF soldiers, and that injured people were “crisis actors.” Deepfakes of Premier Chris Minns and doctored images of victims circulated, even targeting a Pakistani man wrongly identified as a suspect. The platform’s fact‑checking system was shut down, leaving users to sift through misinformation with little help."
