title: "Adults in England can wait almost two years for eating disorder care"
summary: "People with eating disorders in England are facing long waits for help. A new report shows adults can wait up to 700 days (almost two years) to start treatment, while kids get help much faster. The study found fewer adult teams than for children, and most waits happen because demand is higher than capacity. The charity Beat says the gap is worrying and urges faster, local services for all ages."
