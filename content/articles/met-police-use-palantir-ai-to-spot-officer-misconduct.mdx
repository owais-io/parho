summary: "The Metropolitan Police are using Palantir’s AI to comb through data on sickness, absences and overtime, looking for patterns that could signal low standards or misconduct. The Police Federation warns the system risks unfairly flagging officers and calls for human oversight. The Met says the pilot helps find issues early, but critics worry about privacy and “automated suspicion.” Palantir has contracts with other UK forces, the NHS and the defence ministry."
