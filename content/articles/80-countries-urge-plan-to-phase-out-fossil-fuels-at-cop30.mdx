title: "80+ Countries Urge Plan to Phase Out Fossil Fuels at Cop30"
summary: "At the Cop30 climate summit, more than 80 countries from every region demanded a clear roadmap to stop using fossil fuels. The group pushed back against oil‑rich nations that want to keep the status quo. Brazil’s hosts drafted a tentative plan, but many said it wasn’t strong enough. The push shows that while most nations want a phase‑out, getting everyone to agree is still a tough challenge."
