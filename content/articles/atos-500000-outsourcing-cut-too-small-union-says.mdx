title: "ATO's $500,000 Outsourcing Cut Too Small, Union Says"
summary: "The Australian Taxation Office says it will cut outsourced work by $500,000 this year, but the union thinks that figure is too small – even a typo. A senator said the target is ‘woefully inadequate’ and that the ATO should be leading the way in bringing jobs back in-house. Other government agencies are also slow to cut consultants, and outsourcing has led to poor service and low pay for workers."
