title: "Scrapping India’s rural job guarantee could spark a revolt"
summary: "India’s MGNREGA gives rural adults a guaranteed job for up to 100 days, boosting wages, supporting women and keeping people from moving to cities. The government now wants to replace that with a centrally run plan that limits funding and gives Delhi more power. Critics say it turns the right into a conditional promise. If states cut work, farmers and women could feel cheated, leading to protests and even a revolt."
