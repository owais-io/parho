title: "US bans UK anti‑hate campaigners, sparking a free‑speech debate"
summary: "A senior Labour MP said the US was attacking free speech after the Trump administration announced visa bans on five Europeans, including two UK anti‑hate activists. The ban was aimed at people who criticize the US tech industry, especially social‑media owner Elon Musk. The MP argued that banning them is wrong and that a wider debate about regulating social media is needed. The UK government has defended the activists, while the US says they are trying to censor American views."
