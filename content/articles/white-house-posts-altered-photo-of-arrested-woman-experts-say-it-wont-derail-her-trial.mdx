title: "White House posts altered photo of arrested woman; experts say it won’t derail her trial"
summary: "The White House shared a digitally‑altered picture of Nekima Levy Armstrong, a woman arrested in Minneapolis during a protest, showing her with a darker skin tone and tears. Legal experts say the image is unlikely to stop her criminal case, but it could give the defense a chance to challenge the credibility of government evidence and argue that the case has been unfairly biased. Some lawyers think the photo will have little impact on the trial itself."
