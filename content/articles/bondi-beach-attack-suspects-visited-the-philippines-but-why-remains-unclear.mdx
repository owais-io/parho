title: "Bondi Beach attack suspects visited the Philippines, but why remains unclear"
summary: "Police are looking at why two men who shot 15 people at a Jewish festival on Bondi Beach had recently been in the Philippines. They visited Mindanao, an area that has struggled with Islamic State militants. The men returned just weeks before the attack, but investigators don’t know if they received training or simply were influenced by extremist ideas. The attack was simple – shooting a crowd – and shows how IS ideology still attracts Australians."
