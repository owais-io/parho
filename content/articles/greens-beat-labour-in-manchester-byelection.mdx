title: "Greens Beat Labour in Manchester Byelection"
summary: "The Greens won the Gorton and Denton by‑election, their first seat in the north and the biggest byelection result ever. The victory shows progressive voters can choose the Greens instead of Labour, hurting Labour’s support in strongholds. Labour’s loss fuels questions about Jeremy Starmer’s direction. Reform came second, and the Conservatives performed poorly, winning only 1.9%."
