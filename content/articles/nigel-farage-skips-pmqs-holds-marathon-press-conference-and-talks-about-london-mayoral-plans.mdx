title: "Nigel Farage skips PMQs, holds marathon press conference, and talks about London mayoral plans"
summary: "Nigel Farage, who just won a seat in Parliament after many attempts, is avoiding his duties in the Commons. He chose to sit in the gallery instead of the opposition benches and skipped the first PMQs of the year, preferring to appear on radio instead. He then gave a long press conference, focusing on a 2027 London mayoral election he claimed is coming early, and introduced a candidate who said he would drastically change the city’s policing and transport. Farage’s comments were often confusing and drew criticism."
