title: "UK inflation drops to 3%, may trigger early interest‑rate cut"
summary: "UK inflation fell to 3% in January, the lowest since March 2025, thanks to cheaper petrol, food and airfares. Core inflation slid to 3.1%, boosting hopes that the Bank of England could cut rates to 3.5% as early as March. The move would help households, who also benefit from the government’s energy‑bill cuts and rail fare freeze. Growth is sluggish, unemployment is high, and some economists want more proof before cutting rates."
