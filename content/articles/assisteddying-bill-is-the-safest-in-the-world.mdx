title: "Assisted‑dying bill is the safest in the world"
summary: "Dr Lucy Thomas says the House of Lords is over‑reviewing the assisted‑dying bill, with 1,000 changes that block progress. She calls odd rules—like asking dying patients to give a negative pregnancy test—unnecessary. The bill, she argues, is safer than any other worldwide and lets doctors refuse if they wish. Opponents are stalling, hurting patients who want relief from unbearable pain, like Tony Nicklinson, and the law should move forward without those limits."
