title: "A&E staff shouldn’t have to accept abuse"
summary: "At Swindon's Great Western Hospital, a staffer named Hugo was verbally abused and threatened by a drunken patient. He had to call security and the police were needed to stop the attack. Surveys show a quarter of A&E workers have faced bullying or violence, but most don’t report it. In response, the hospital has launched a “Never OK” campaign with police training, a new reporting email, and a seven‑point action plan to change the culture, support victims and make violence unacceptable."
