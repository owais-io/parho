title: "Australian cars use far more fuel than lab tests say"
summary: "The Australian Automobile Association tested 141 cars and found that 76% use more fuel on the road than lab tests say. Models like GWM Tank 300, Honda HR‑V and Hyundai Santa Fe ran 11‑25% higher fuel use. The test also showed electric cars fall short of their claimed range. The findings highlight the gap between lab results and real‑world driving and could affect government emissions targets and penalties."
