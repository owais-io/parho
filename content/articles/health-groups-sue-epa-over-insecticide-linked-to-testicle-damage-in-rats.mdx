title: "Health groups sue EPA over insecticide linked to testicle damage in rats"
summary: "Health groups are suing the EPA after it approved the insecticide isocycloseram, a PFAS “forever chemical”. Lab tests on rats show the pesticide shrinks testicle size, lowers sperm and harms the liver. Groups say the EPA ignored child‑safety rules and relied too much on industry data. The lawsuit also points to the agency’s leadership, which many say is run by former industry lobbyists."
