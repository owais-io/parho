title: "Energy bills to drop £138 a year from April"
summary: "From April, the UK’s energy price cap will fall by 8%, saving the average household about £138 on its yearly bill, bringing the cost down to roughly £1,620. The change follows the autumn budget, which moved some energy‑related charges to general tax and cut the renewables‑obligation fee. However, the government will still pay for £28 bn of grid upgrades, adding about £108 a year to bills by 2031. The aim is a £300 cut by 2030, but many costs simply shift to taxpayers."
