title: "UK Restaurants Cut Vegetarian Options as Meat Grows Popular"
summary: "In 2021 UK diners loved plant‑based meals, but by 2026 many fast‑food and restaurant chains are pulling back their veggie menus. McDonald’s, Domino’s and others have removed most vegetarian options, keeping only the McPlant burger. Data shows pubs, bars and restaurants now favour meat, especially chicken, as costs rise and customers look for higher‑margin, protein‑rich dishes. Some experts say the shift is a market correction, not a loss of interest in plant‑based food."
