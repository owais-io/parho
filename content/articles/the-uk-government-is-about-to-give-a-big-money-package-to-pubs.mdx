title: "The UK government is about to give a big money package to pubs."
summary: "Why? Pubs will face higher business‑rate bills in this year’s budget.   Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said in her 2021 speech that she would cut business‑rate costs for retail, hospitality and leisure properties. She promised lower rates for 750,000+ places, but the new cuts were erased by the end of Covid‑relief and a new re‑valuation that will increase rates for many pubs in 2026. The pub sector has been shouting for help.   The government is now changing its plans.   Details are not yet announced, but the rescue package will come soon. The government often changes its mind on big policy.   This is called a U‑turn.   Labour leader Anna Turley says it isn’t a U‑turn. She says it shows the government is listening.   That’s a normal thing for any government. Keir Starmer might look weak for doing many U‑turns.   Other news today:   – The Lords are debating the assisted dying bill again.   – Downing Street will have a lobby briefing at 11:30 a.m.   – The Commons is not sitting today.   If you want to contact me, put “Andrew” in your message so I’ll see it.   I will try to reply to as many questions as I can."
