title: "Government Cuts Energy Rebates, Treasurer Announces Tough Budget Choices"
summary: "Australia’s treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the government will stop the $7 billion energy bill rebate next year as the country faces higher inflation and possible interest‑rate hikes. The cut comes as part of a mid‑year budget update that will focus on savings, not new policies, because spending on veterans, disaster relief and other programs is running high. Economists say ending the rebates was sensible, and critics called the earlier scheme “political pork.”"
