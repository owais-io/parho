title: "Rupert Lowe’s bid to stop MP watchdog investigation fails"
summary: "A high‑court judge rejected MP Rupert Lowe’s attempt to block the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme from probing a complaint about him. Lowe, who has launched a new party, sought an interim injunction, but the court said the public interest in keeping the watchdog operational outweighed any harm to him. He still faces a legal challenge over the scheme’s procedures, but the investigation can proceed."
