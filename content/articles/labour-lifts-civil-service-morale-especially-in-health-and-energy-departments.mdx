title: "Labour lifts civil service morale, especially in health and energy departments"
summary: "Labour’s first year in power has nudged civil service morale up, rising from 60.7% to 61.2% on an employee engagement survey. The biggest lifts came in the Health & Social Care and Energy departments, up 5 and 7 points. Most other departments also improved a little, while four saw declines – the Foreign Office, HMRC, MoD and Transport, the latter dropping 3 points. Transport’s dip reflected staff worries about change and decision‑making."
