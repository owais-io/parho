title: "Instagram will notify parents when teens search self‑harm topics"
summary: "Instagram is adding a new feature that will send alerts to parents if their teens repeatedly search for terms linked to suicide or self‑harm. The alerts come only to parents who sign up for the platform’s parental‑supervision program and will be delivered via email, text or WhatsApp. Meta already blocks such content in teen accounts and points users to helplines. The move comes amid court cases questioning whether the company’s platforms harm children."
