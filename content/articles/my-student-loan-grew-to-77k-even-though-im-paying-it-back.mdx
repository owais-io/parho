title: "My student loan grew to £77k even though I'm paying it back"
summary: "My student loan started at £57k and now is over £77k, even though I’ve been paying back each month. The high interest rate—up to 8%—adds more to the debt than my payments reduce it. New rules keep the repayment threshold frozen until 2030, meaning more people will owe more as they earn. Experts say most borrowers shouldn’t overpay, and some want the debt rebranded as a graduate tax."
