title: "I got a £100 parking fine while charging my electric car"
summary: "I was charging my electric car at a 24‑hour station in a B&Q car park and got a £100 parking fine. The operator said parking was banned 9 pm‑6 am, but no clear signs explained this. The retailer admitted the 24‑hour claim was misleading and changed its website. The company later cancelled all PCNs for that spot, but the incident shows how confusing signs can lead to costly fines."
