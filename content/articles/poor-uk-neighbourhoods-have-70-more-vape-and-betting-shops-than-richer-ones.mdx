title: "Poor UK neighbourhoods have 70% more vape and betting shops than richer ones"
summary: "In the UK, the poorest neighbourhoods have about 70% more vape shops, off‑licences and bookmakers than wealthier ones, but they also have fewer cafés, gyms and community spaces, and higher shop vacancy rates. A study warns that government plans focusing only on town centres miss these local “shopping parades” where people shop. The £5 bn ‘Pride in Place’ programme aims to help communities take over empty units, but critics say policy coordination remains weak."
