title: "How a Tiny Swedish Town Became a Game‑Development Powerhouse"
summary: "A small Swedish town called Skövde, with just 58,000 residents, has turned into a major video‑game hub. In the early 2000s the university started a game‑development degree, saying “if we build it, they’ll come.” That idea sparked companies like Coffee Stain (Goat Simulator), Iron Gate (Valheim) and Stunlock (V Rising). Today almost 1,000 people study or work in gaming there, far more than in many larger cities. The city’s tight community and local support have made it a surprising industry success."
