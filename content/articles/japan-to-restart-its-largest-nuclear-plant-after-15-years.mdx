title: "Japan to restart its largest nuclear plant after 15 years"
summary: "Tepco plans to bring one of the seven reactors at the world’s biggest nuclear plant back online, even though the plant has been shut down since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The move could add about 2 % of Tokyo’s power and help Japan cut emissions, but many residents within 30 km say the plant is unsafe and that evacuation plans are weak. They want a vote, while Tepco says safety has improved."
