title: "Stop Fatbergs: Don’t Pour Cooking Oil, Milk, or Other Liquids Down the Drain"
summary: "Fatbergs block pipes when cooking oil, grease, milk, wipes, and chemicals mix in drains. The result is costly cleaning, overflows, and polluted waterways. To keep sewers clear, wipe oil with a paper towel and throw it in the bin, seal big amounts in a container, and use a sink strainer for food scraps. Don’t use a garbage disposal, and never flush medicine, paint, or motor oil. Dispose of leftovers through rubbish or a return program."
