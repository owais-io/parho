title: "DMT Shows Promise in Helping People With Depression"
summary: "A new study shows that a drug made from DMT, a chemical found in the Amazonian tea ayahuasca, may help people with depression. In a phase‑II trial, 17 patients got a DMT shot and 17 got a placebo, all with therapist support. Two weeks later, the DMT group felt noticeably better. The trial was small, so more research is needed."
