title: "Guardian Issues Corrections for Recent Articles"
summary: "The Guardian has announced a number of corrections to its recent publications. It clarified that Keely Hodgkinson’s indoor 800‑metre world‑record time was 1:54.87, not 1:54.88, and that the margin over the old record was 0.95 seconds. It also fixed a caption mistake in a biathlon photo where Jürgen Klopp’s bell‑ringing was mislabelled. Other corrections involve a picture caption about a biathlon relay, a report on Epstein’s influence, a flood vigil photo, an article about climate particulates, and several political pieces. The Guardian invites readers to submit complaints via email or voicemail to ensure accurate reporting."
