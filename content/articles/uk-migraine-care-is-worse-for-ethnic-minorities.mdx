title: "UK Migraine Care Is Worse for Ethnic Minorities"
summary: "A UK survey of 2,200 migraine sufferers shows that people from ethnic minorities often get poorer care. About 23 % of mixed‑ethnicity, 19 % of Asian and 16 % of black respondents said their background hurt their treatment, compared with just 7 % of white respondents. Black people were more scared of discrimination or job loss. Many also felt dismissed or misdiagnosed, and experts say the system must change to treat everyone fairly."
