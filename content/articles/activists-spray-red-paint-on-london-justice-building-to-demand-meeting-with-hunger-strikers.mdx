summary: "Pro‑Palestine activists sprayed red paint on the London Ministry of Justice building to ask the justice secretary, David Lammy, to meet with eight hunger‑striking prisoners. The paint was meant to look like blood. Two demonstrators were arrested. The prisoners, linked to Palestine Action, have been on hunger strike for over a month and could be held more than a year before trial. MP Jeremy Corbyn called Lammy’s refusal “outrageous”, while Lammy said prisoner safety is the priority."
