summary: "Trump’s draft plan to end the Ukraine war would hand over key Ukrainian territories to Russia, ban Ukraine from NATO, and let Russia join the G8 again. It would cut Ukraine’s army to 600,000 soldiers and give vague security promises. The deal would lift most sanctions on Russia but re‑impose them if it attacks Ukraine again. Some Ukrainian officials are furious, while President Zelensky plans to talk to Trump soon."
