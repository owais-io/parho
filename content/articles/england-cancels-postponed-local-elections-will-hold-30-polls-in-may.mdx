title: "England cancels postponed local elections, will hold 30 polls in May"
summary: "The UK government has decided to hold 30 local elections that were previously postponed, after legal advice said it could lose a court case. The elections will take place in May and involve councils mainly run by Labour. The original plan aimed to save money by merging councils into unitary authorities, but Reform UK’s legal challenge forced a change. Politicians and voters welcome the move, seeing it as a win for democracy."
