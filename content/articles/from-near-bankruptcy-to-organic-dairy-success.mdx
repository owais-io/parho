title: "From Near-Bankruptcy to Organic Dairy Success"
summary: "Bryce Cunningham, a former Mercedes engineer, took over his family's dairy farm after his father’s death. Facing a sharp milk‑price drop and heavy debt, he switched to organic milk, cut the herd, and used returnable glass bottles. He crowdfunded new equipment, helped the farm survive COVID and energy crises, and now processes 1.5 million litres a year, works with other organic farms, and powers operations with solar and biomass."
