title: "Wage hikes may keep the UK from cutting interest rates"
summary: "Bank of England policy maker Megan Greene says wages are rising again, which could keep inflation high and stop the bank from lowering rates this year. She worries that higher pay, coupled with slower productivity growth, will push prices up. Greene also notes that if the U.S. Fed cuts rates faster, UK inflation could rise because more money will chase UK goods. The bank has been caught underestimating past inflation."
