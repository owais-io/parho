title: "Dairy Farmers Lose £1,800 a Day as Milk Prices Drop"
summary: "Paul Tompkins wakes at 4.40 a.m. and already knows he’s losing £1,800 that day because milk sells for less than his production cost. Milk prices have fallen sharply, driven by too much supply from Britain, the US and New Zealand, while fuel, fertiliser and labour costs rise. More than a third of British dairy farmers have left, and the industry fears another 10 % may quit. Supermarket prices will drop slowly, with butter next spring and cheese a few months later."
