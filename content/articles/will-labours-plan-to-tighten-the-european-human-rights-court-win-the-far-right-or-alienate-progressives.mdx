title: "Will Labour’s plan to tighten the European Human Rights Court win the far right or alienate progressives?"
summary: "Labour wants the European Human Rights Court to change its rules so UK judges will be less likely to stop deportations. The move is aimed at calming voters worried about crime and immigration. Some left‑wing people fear it could hurt human‑rights principles and turn off progressive voters. While the Conservatives want to leave the court, Labour wants to stay but tighten its power."
