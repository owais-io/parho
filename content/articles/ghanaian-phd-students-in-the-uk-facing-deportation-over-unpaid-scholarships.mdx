title: "Ghanaian PhD Students in the UK Facing Deportation Over Unpaid Scholarships"
summary: "Ghanaian PhD students studying at UK universities are in danger of being deported because their scholarships and tuition fees haven’t been paid. About 100 students say the Ghanaian government owes roughly £32 million, and some universities have already cancelled their registrations. They’ve written to the UK government for help, but many have been evicted, faced court over rent, or had to rely on food banks. The Ghanaian scholarship office is still reviewing payments and has paused new aid."
