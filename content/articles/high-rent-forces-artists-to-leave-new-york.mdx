title: "High rent forces artists to leave New York"
summary: "Many New York artists are moving away because rent is rising faster than their income. A report says the city’s artist population fell more than 4 % since 2019, and places like Bushwick, Lower East Side and Upper West Side have lost many artists. The city promised 200,000 new units but has built no homes specifically for artists, so some are moving to Philly, LA and other cities that offer artist‑friendly housing. Galleries and musicians are following the trend as costs climb."
