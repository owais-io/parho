title: "Scabies Outbreak Forces Families to Take Extreme Clean‑Up Measures"
summary: "A 44‑year‑old mother in south‑west England had to take her kids into a caravan, change clothes at every doorway and wash everything in hot water to fight a scabies outbreak that spread through her home. The condition, caused by tiny skin‑burrowing mites, has risen sharply in the UK, especially in schools and hostels. Doctors say clean‑up, proper medication and quick treatment are key, but many people feel ashamed and delayed."
