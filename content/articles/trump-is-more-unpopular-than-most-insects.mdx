title: "Trump Is More Unpopular Than Most Insects"
summary: "A YouGov survey found that 86% of Americans dislike mosquitoes, 84% dislike cockroaches, and 76% dislike wasps. Trump’s current disapproval stands at 61%, higher than spiders (57%) and ants (52%) but lower than wasps. With all 435 House seats up for grabs in the 2026 midterms, the GOP’s slim advantage could shrink if voters reject an unpopular president. Republicans hold a fundraising edge, with over $600 m available compared to under $200 m for Democrats."
