summary: "The US and Britain said Russia’s Oreshnik missile attack on Ukraine was a dangerous escalation. In a UN emergency meeting, officials called it reckless and a threat to global safety. Russia says the missile hit an aircraft repair shop, but Ukraine hasn’t confirmed the damage. Analysts think the missiles were likely dummies. Meanwhile, Russian forces struck Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa, killing and injuring civilians, and also hit two food‑carrying ships. Civilian deaths in Ukraine rose sharply this year. Separately, a US‑linked company secured rights to mine lithium in Ukraine."
