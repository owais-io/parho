title: "Doctors and Health Secretary Asked to Use Mediator to End Strikes"
summary: "NHS bosses want the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and the doctors’ union to hire an independent mediator to stop a 5‑day strike by resident doctors that starts Wednesday. The doctors are protesting for a 26 % pay rise over three years and more training places, while the secretary says the demand is too costly. The strike will halt thousands of tests and treatments and could leave patients in pain. If no deal is reached, the dispute might keep going for years."
