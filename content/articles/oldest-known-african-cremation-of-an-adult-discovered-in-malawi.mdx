title: "Oldest known African cremation of an adult discovered in Malawi"
summary: "An ancient 9,500‑year‑old fire pit in Malawi holds the oldest known cremated adult in Africa. Archaeologists found 170 bone fragments of a short woman in ash layers. The bones show cuts and missing skull, suggesting ritual removal of body parts rather than violence. The find, first of its kind for hunter‑gatherers, hints at complex social rituals and belief systems long before pastoral societies. It pushes back Africa’s cremation record by over 6,000 years."
