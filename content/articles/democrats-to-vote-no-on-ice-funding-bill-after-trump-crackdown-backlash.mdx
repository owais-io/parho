title: "Democrats to Vote No on ICE Funding Bill After Trump Crackdown Backlash"
summary: "House Democrats are expected to vote against a bill that would give ICE its annual $10 billion budget. Party leaders say the money isn’t enough to stop the agency’s harsh tactics, especially after the violent crackdown in Minnesota that killed mother Renee Good. The bill does cut some enforcement and detention beds and adds body‑camera funding, but most Democrats say it still leaves ICE too powerful. A no vote could help avoid a government shutdown but also leaves ICE funded."
