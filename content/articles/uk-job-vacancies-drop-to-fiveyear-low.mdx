title: "UK job vacancies drop to five‑year low"
summary: "In January 2026, the UK advertised just 695,000 jobs, the fewest in five years. Vacancy numbers fell 3% from December and are now below 700,000 for the first time since 2021. The drop is part of a broader trend, with companies cutting hiring because of higher labour costs and a shift to automation. Young workers feel the hit hardest: 18‑to‑24‑year‑olds saw the highest unemployment rate in five years, 14%. Still, average salaries rose about 6% to £43,289, beating inflation."
