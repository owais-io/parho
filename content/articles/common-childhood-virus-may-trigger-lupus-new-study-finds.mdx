title: "Common Childhood Virus May Trigger Lupus, New Study Finds"
summary: "Researchers say that the Epstein‑Barr virus (EBV), which most people get as a mild childhood illness, may be the cause of lupus in all cases. They found that EBV hides in immune cells called B‑cells and turns them into over‑reactive attackers that damage the body. The study, led by Stanford scientists, suggests that vaccines against EBV or drugs that target B‑cells could offer new treatments for lupus patients. The work could change how doctors manage the disease."
