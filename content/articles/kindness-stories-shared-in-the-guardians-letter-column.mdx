title: "Kindness Stories Shared in the Guardian’s Letter Column"
summary: "The Guardian’s letter column shares a handful of short notes. One recalls a 1990s duty sergeant at Huyton police who was surprised when a man walked in with £1,000 he’d found, and another came in to hand over the station’s cash that he’d forgotten. Other letters joke about a misplaced sign, correct geography and even AI’s climate impact. Readers are invited to share their own thoughts."
