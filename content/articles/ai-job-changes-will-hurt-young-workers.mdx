title: "AI Job Changes Will Hurt Young Workers"
summary: "The IMF chief warned that artificial intelligence will change or eliminate up to 60 % of jobs in rich countries. She said entry‑level roles – the ones most held by young people – are most at risk, making it harder for new workers to get good jobs. Workers whose roles aren’t directly affected may see pay fall. The IMF stresses the need for rules that protect workers, share productivity gains, and keep AI safe and inclusive."
