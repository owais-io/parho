title: "Scottish Government Says Rule to Put Trans Women in Men’s Prisons Is Wrong"
summary: "The Scottish government says a rule that would put trans women in men’s prisons is wrong. It argues the rule denies their identity and could harm their mental health and chances of getting better. Lawyers for the government say people should be placed in a prison that matches their gender, only if a risk assessment says otherwise. The Equality and Human Rights Commission wants new guidance after a Supreme Court decision."
