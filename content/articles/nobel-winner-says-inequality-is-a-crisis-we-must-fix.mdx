Since 2000 the richest 1 % earned 41 % of new wealth, while the bottom half earned just 1 %. Over two billion people now struggle with food. Stiglitz argues inequality is caused by policy choices like deregulation and low taxes, not “globalisation.” He wants a new global framework, including an International Panel on Inequality, to curb this crisis."
