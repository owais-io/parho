title: "China and Saudi Arabia Receive Large Climate Loans, Analysis Shows"
summary: "New research shows rich countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE receive most of the world’s climate‑finance money—mostly loans. About a fifth of the funds went to the 44 poorest nations, but many of those loans must be repaid, adding to debt. The study covered 20,000 projects from 2021‑22 and found $98 bn went to developing countries and $33 bn to the poorest. Climate leaders say the money is growing but still not enough and must shift toward grants and fair terms."
