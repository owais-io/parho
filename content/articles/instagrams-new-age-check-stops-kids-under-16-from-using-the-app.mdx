title: "Instagram’s new age check stops kids under 16 from using the app"
summary: "Australia has banned kids under 16 from using social media. Instagram now asks anyone who might be under 16 to prove their age with a quick video selfie. An adult in a test case passed the check instantly, while a 13‑year‑old got stuck and had to show ID. The system works fast but can misread people near 16 or from minority groups. The ban will hit many platforms by December."
