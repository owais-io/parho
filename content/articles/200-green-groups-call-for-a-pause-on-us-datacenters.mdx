title: "200+ Green Groups Call for a Pause on U.S. Datacenters"
summary: "More than 230 environmental groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, have asked Congress to stop new U.S. data‑center builds. They say these facilities use huge amounts of water and electricity, raise power bills, and add carbon emissions that harm the climate. The push has influenced elections and pressures President Trump, who promised to cut energy costs. Voters see rising utility prices as a top worry, so the groups want stricter rules before new sites open."
