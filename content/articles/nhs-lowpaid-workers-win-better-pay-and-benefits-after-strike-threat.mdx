title: "NHS low‑paid workers win better pay and benefits after strike threat"
summary: "Workers at three NHS hospitals, mostly cleaners, caterers and porters, almost all voted to strike because they had been paid less than other staff and missed out on pension and holiday benefits. The trust finally agreed to give them the same NHS “Agenda for Change” contracts. They will get higher hourly rates, more holiday days, better pension contributions and pay for weekend shifts. The union praised the victory as a win for equality."
