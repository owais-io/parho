title: "Goldman Sachs removes race, gender and LGBTQ+ criteria from board hiring"
summary: "Goldman Sachs will stop using race, gender, and other diversity factors when selecting new board members after pressure from a small shareholder group, the National Legal and Policy Center. The group had asked 11 big firms to drop DEI criteria. Goldman’s board will approve the change this month. The move follows a broader trend of U.S. companies trimming diversity programs after a Trump‑era push against DEI."
