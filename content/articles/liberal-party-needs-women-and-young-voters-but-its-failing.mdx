title: "Liberal Party Needs Women and Young Voters, but It’s Failing"
summary: "The Liberal Party has lost support among younger voters and women. After losing the last election, its leaders have made quick, confusing moves: appointing a female leader, then firing her, dropping net‑zero, and leaning on hard‑line immigration. Polls show millennials and Gen Z back Labor 64–68%, and women favour Labor by nine points. Cost‑of‑living worries dominate voters’ priorities, not immigration. The Liberals need a clear economic plan to regain trust."
