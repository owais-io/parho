title: "UK Class Sizes: Should They Be Smaller?"
summary: "UK primary schools have some of the biggest class sizes in the developed world. The debate over whether smaller groups help is still open. Independent schools have fewer pupils per teacher, which many say gives their students an edge. Research shows mixed results—smaller rooms may boost interaction and support special needs, but they don’t always raise exam scores. With tight budgets, any change would need new funding rules."
