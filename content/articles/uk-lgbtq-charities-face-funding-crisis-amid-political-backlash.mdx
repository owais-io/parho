title: "UK LGBTQ+ charities face funding crisis amid political backlash"
summary: "UK LGBTQ+ charities are in a tough spot. Donations from companies have dropped sharply, with Stonewall's corporate giving falling by more than half. The decline comes after US President Trump’s moves against diversity, equity and inclusion, which have made businesses nervous about supporting trans causes. Small charities also face higher costs and potential legal battles over transgender‑inclusive policies. The result is a hostile environment that forces many groups to cut staff, rely more on volunteers, and look for new funding."
