title: "English university students now receive only two‑thirds of the funding they had 10 years ago"
summary: "Money for teaching at English universities has dropped about 36 % in real terms since 2015‑16, says Universities UK. While the government raised tuition to £9,535 this year and will link it to inflation, it also plans a new tax on international student fees that could cost universities £780 m a year. Many schools have cut courses and face budget deficits, urging the government to rethink the levy."
