title: "Extreme Heat Could Double the Global Population Affected by 2050"
summary: "A new study shows that if the planet warms by 2°C by 2050, the number of people who will face extreme heat could more than double – from about 1.5 billion in 2010 to almost 4 billion by 2050. The worst hits are in the tropics, especially India, Nigeria, Indonesia and Bangladesh. The biggest jump happens early, around 1.5°C, meaning we need to act sooner. The rise will strain homes, power grids, and health systems."
