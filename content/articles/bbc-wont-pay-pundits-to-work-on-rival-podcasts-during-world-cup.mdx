title: "BBC Won’t Pay Pundits to Work on Rival Podcasts During World Cup"
summary: "The BBC says it won’t use licence‑fee money to pay pundits, like Micah Richards, for work on rival podcasts during the World Cup. The broadcaster will keep most coverage in its Salford studio to cut costs and lower its carbon footprint. Pundits can still do other media jobs, but any travel or production fees must come from sponsors such as Netflix’s Goalhanger. The BBC is not subsidising these costs."
