title: "Labour Blocks Andy Burnham From Running in By‑Election, Sparking Party Outcry"
summary: "Labour’s national executive committee said Andy Burnham, the popular mayor of Greater Manchester, cannot stand in the Gorton and Denton by‑election. The move was meant to avoid a costly mayoral vote and keep party unity, but many MPs and union leaders say it’s unfair and could let Reform UK win the seat. The decision has split the party, with Starmer’s allies saying it protects the government, while critics call it a mistake."
