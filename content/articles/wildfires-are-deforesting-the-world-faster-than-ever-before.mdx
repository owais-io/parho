title: "Wildfires Are Deforesting the World Faster Than Ever Before"
summary: "Wildfires are burning forests at an all‑time high. In 2024 alone, 135,000 km² of trees were lost – the biggest year on record – with the Amazon, Canada, Russia and Australia hit hardest. Heat waves, drought and thawing permafrost are making fires bigger and longer. The smoke and carbon released worsen climate change, while communities face smoke, evacuation and loss of wildlife. Stopping deforestation and better fire planning can help curb the damage."
