title: "England’s Doctor Strikes Could Continue for Years"
summary: "In England, resident doctors have been striking for months over a 26% pay raise. The strikes, now in their 14th round, have already slowed the NHS, with many patients waiting for tests, overcrowded A&E, and beds running out. Labour's health secretary says the government can’t afford the pay rise and has offered more training spots, which doctors rejected. Public support for the strikes is low, and the dispute may drag into next year."
