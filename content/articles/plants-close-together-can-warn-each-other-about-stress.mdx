title: "Plants Close Together Can Warn Each Other About Stress"
summary: "Plants that grow close together can warn each other when they’re under stress, like bright light. In experiments with thale cress, isolated plants suffered damage, but crowded plants survived. The crowded group quickly activated more than 2,000 protective genes. The signal was a burst of hydrogen peroxide that moved between plants, the first time this chemical has been shown to travel from one plant to another as a warning."
