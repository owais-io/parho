title: "Media Misunderstand the ECHR’s Right to Family Life"
summary: "The Guardian article points out that the media often misread the European Convention on Human Rights’ “right to family life.” The report says deportation can only be blocked if it would be “unduly harsh” on a family and public interest is outweighed, and only 0.73% of foreign offenders have used this rule successfully. Having a partner or child in the UK does not guarantee a win. The Home Office also fails to publish data on deportations after prison, raising concerns about enforcement."
