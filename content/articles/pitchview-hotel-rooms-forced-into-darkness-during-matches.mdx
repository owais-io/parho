title: "Pitch‑view hotel rooms forced into darkness during matches"
summary: "At Blackpool’s football stadium hotel, guests who book a ‘pitch‑view’ room still have to keep curtains drawn when a match is on. The rule, backed by the EFL’s alcohol‑ban laws, forces the room into darkness and can cost a £2,500 fine if a curtain is open. The story points out the oddness of a ‘view’ that disappears, and calls for a rethink of old alcohol rules that limit fans’ enjoyment."
