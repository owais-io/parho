summary: "California’s fish and game commission just added over 1,400 mountain lions to the state’s endangered species list. Six groups from the Bay Area to the Mexican border were identified as at risk of extinction. The move means state agencies must protect the cats and new projects must reduce harm, with plans for wildlife crossings, safer roads and stricter poison rules. Some ranchers worry about safety, but officials say protection is the right call."
