title: "Milton Keynes Council Battles to Save Iconic Point Cinema"
summary: "Forty years ago The Point opened in Milton Keynes as the UK's first multiplex. Its pyramid made it a landmark. After the cinema closed in 2015, the building sat empty and is now targeted for demolition by developers who want to build apartments. Local groups, politicians and the Twentieth Century Society are fighting to keep the cinema, saying it’s a key part of the town’s history. The council has appealed, and Historic England may list the building for protection."
