title: "NDIA workers attacked, safety changes take almost three years"
summary: "NDIA workers have been threatened, attacked, and even livestreamed while doing their jobs. A government review in 2023 found 36 urgent safety fixes but staff didn’t get the report until May 2024. The agency says it will act, yet many basic measures like CCTV and secure rooms won’t be in place until February 2027. Workers and unions say this delay is unacceptable and the safety risks are real."
