title: "UK MPs demand full disclosure of costly medicines deal with the US"
summary: "MPs from several parties are pressing the government to reveal the hidden costs of a new medicines agreement with the United States. They say the deal will make drugs more expensive for the NHS and could cost the UK billions by 2035, yet ministers have only offered short‑term figures and no full impact report. The cross‑party group wants an independent review, a Commons debate, and a clear plan for how the extra spending will be funded."
