title: "UK kebab chain uses robot slicers and self‑service tech to stay profitable"
summary: "German Doner Kebab in the UK is fighting rising costs by using robot slicers, self‑service screens and a loyalty app. The robot cuts meat from the rotisserie faster and more evenly than people, saving labor time. New outlets use automatic bread toasters, a central kitchen for sauces and touch‑screen ordering that handles most sales. The chain also offers new, healthier menu items to attract younger diners and keeps customers in‑store rather than on delivery apps."
