title: "Plant Small Native Trees to Boost England's Tree Cover"
summary: "Gardeners are being encouraged to plant small native trees called “tredges,” which sit between a hedge and a tree, to help England reach its goal of more woodland. The Royal Horticultural Society says species like hawthorn are hardy, tidy, and good for wildlife and air quality. A showcase garden will open at the Chelsea Flower Show and later move to a Newcastle school to boost local tree cover. Using UK‑grown seed helps keep pests out."
