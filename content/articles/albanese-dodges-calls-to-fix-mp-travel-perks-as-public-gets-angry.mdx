title: "Albanese Dodges Calls to Fix MP Travel Perks as Public Gets Angry"
summary: "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese ignored questions about MPs using taxpayer money to fly family members to sports and events. He said the travel rules haven’t changed and he wouldn’t comment on potential reforms. Albanese focused on a new under‑16 social media ban instead. Critics say the rules give ministers unlimited spousal travel, costing taxpayers thousands. An independent audit will review one minister’s claims, but no wider change is expected soon."
