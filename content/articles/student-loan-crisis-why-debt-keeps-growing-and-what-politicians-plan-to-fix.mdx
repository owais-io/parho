title: "Student Loan Crisis: Why Debt Keeps Growing and What Politicians Plan to Fix"
summary: "Millions of graduates in England and Wales owe big loans that keep getting bigger because interest keeps adding up while the money they pay back is low. A budget rule froze the pay level that triggers repayments, so many students keep paying 9% of earnings even when they earn more. Politicians are debating ways to lift the freeze or lower interest. Some say not to pay extra unless you earn a lot; others say parents could help their kids."
