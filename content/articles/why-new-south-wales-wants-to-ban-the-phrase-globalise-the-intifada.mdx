title: "Why New South Wales wants to ban the phrase “globalise the intifada”"
summary: "After a mass shooting at Bondi Beach, NSW Premier Chris Minns says the slogan “globalise the intifada” was linked to the attack and wants it banned. The phrase is a call of support for Palestinian protests, but critics say it can fuel violence and that banning it could hurt free speech. Experts worry about outlawing words with contested meanings, and some communities see the ban as an attack on their language and struggle for justice."
