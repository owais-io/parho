title: "Olympic Athletes Captured in Heat Images"
summary: "Getty Images photographers used small thermal cameras at the Winter Olympics to show athletes in glowing yellow and red, while snow looks blue or purple. They pair thermal and regular lenses so the same shot shows both the athlete’s movement and the heat left behind. The trio talks about how this science‑based tool is like a new kind of art, different from normal photography because it uses temperature instead of light. They also tried old‑style cameras and live‑streaming with smartphones."
