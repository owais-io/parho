title: "Documentary follows Ukrainian children’s recovery after kidnapping"
summary: "The film follows three Ukrainian kids who were taken to Russia during the war and later reunited with their parents. Instead of focusing on the political drama, the director shows how they heal at an animal‑therapy retreat in Estonia, with dogs, ponies and the sea. Ukraine reports about 19,000 kids were taken, but only a few have returned. The story is about their daily life, hopes for a new family, and the tough journey home—emotions, not statistics."
