title: "England to Make Deer Shooting Easier to Protect Forests"
summary: "The UK government is moving to make it easier for landowners to shoot deer in England to protect forests. Over 30% of woodlands suffer from deer damage, especially from non‑native species like muntjac, sika and Chinese water deer. New laws will give legal rights to cull deer, create management plans for public land, target high‑impact areas, and change grant payments. The plan also looks at selling deer meat to help funding."
