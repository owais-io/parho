title: "MPs push to rename school transport to cut rising costs"
summary: "MPs on the public accounts committee said councils should change the name of the service from “home‑to‑school transport” to “assisted travel to school.” The change would remind people that the service isn’t a door‑to‑door taxi, which is expensive and was used a lot during Covid. Costs are now £2.3 bn a year, especially for kids with SEND who often need single‑occupancy rides. MPs want councils to use more buses, give clear rules, and keep services for older teens."
