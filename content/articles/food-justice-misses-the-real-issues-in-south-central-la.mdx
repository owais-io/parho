title: "Food Justice Misses the Real Issues in South Central LA"
summary: "Food justice often assumes people in South Central LA don’t know how to cook, but the real problem is that groceries are too expensive and few stores exist. Activists run cooking demos that miss what locals actually want. Many projects focus on quick wins, ignoring deeper issues like poverty and low wages. Grassroots groups that live there use plant‑based traditions and aim for long‑term self‑sufficiency instead of just healthy tips."
