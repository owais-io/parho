title: "UK Supermarkets Target Weight‑Loss Drug Users with New “Jab‑uary” Food Lines"
summary: "Supermarkets in the UK are launching ‘Jab‑uary’ food lines for people taking weight‑loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro. Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Asda, Ocado and the Co‑op sell high‑protein, small‑portion meals that cost from a few pounds to over £100 for a single pack. The move reflects growing demand but also worries about higher prices, shrinkflation and a drop in overall grocery spend as drug users eat less."
