title: "NHS doctor warns hospitals lack enough isolation rooms as flu cases rise"
summary: "Dr. Amir Hassan says flu cases are rising across the UK, putting a heavy load on emergency departments. Hospitals need to isolate sick patients, but many have too few single rooms, forcing care in corridors. He urges people with flu symptoms to stay home, use NHS 111 or their GP, and only go to hospital if they’re very short of breath. The flu hits all ages, especially frail older people, so getting vaccinated is key."
