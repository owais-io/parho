title: "Schools Use Screens Thoughtfully to Teach"
summary: "Teachers at a primary school use screens the same way they used blackboards before. They plan lessons around the computer, saving time and adding videos, photos and sound to make learning richer. Most classes still rely on kids talking, especially with the Voice 21 speech program. In subjects like science, art and maths hands‑on work happens, while outdoor programmes like Opal and forest school give kids play‑based learning in nature."
