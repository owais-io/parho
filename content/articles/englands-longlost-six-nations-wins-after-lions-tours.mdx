title: "England’s Long‑Lost Six Nations Wins After Lions Tours"
summary: "England has never won the Six Nations after a British & Irish Lions tour. The last time it happened was in 1963. Since the professional era in 1995, only France and Ireland have taken the title in those post‑tour windows. The 2025 tournament looks open: a strong England squad, a title‑hungry France, and chances for Scotland, Wales, Italy, and Ireland."
