title: "Editors Warn Starmer’s Plan Cuts Daily Press Questioning at 10 Downing Street"
summary: "Keir Starmer’s government wants to cut the afternoon “lobby” briefing that lets political reporters ask questions of ministers. The plan would leave only one briefing a day and replace some with press conferences that have fewer questions and invite a wider range of media. Editors fear this reduces transparency and limits hard‑questioning, saying it weakens democracy. The opposition has pledged to restore the regular briefings."
