title: "Police Fail to Stop Sexual Offenders After Sarah Everard: A New Report"
summary: "A report from the Sarah Everard inquiry shows police still haven’t banned officers with sexual‑crime convictions, even though the idea was suggested in 2021. It took 18 months for chiefs to agree to a blanket ban, and the Home Office says it will be added but not back‑dated. The report cites 461 police staff flagged last year, 88 disciplinary cases and nine criminal investigations. Most forces still lack basic policies for sexual‑offence cases, so the problem keeps repeating."
