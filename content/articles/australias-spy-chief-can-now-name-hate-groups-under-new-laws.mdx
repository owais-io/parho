title: "Australia’s spy chief can now name hate groups under new laws"
summary: "Australia’s new laws let the spy agency’s head recommend that a group be labelled a hate group. If listed, it becomes a crime to join, support or recruit for it, with jail terms up to 15 years. The measure is meant to catch groups that spread hate but aren’t quite terrorist. The bill also plans a gun buy‑back scheme. While the neo‑Nazi National Socialist Network said it would dissolve before the law is passed, officials warn it could go underground."
