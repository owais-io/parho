title: "UK Business Confidence Falls, Hiring Slows in Late 2025"
summary: "Business confidence in the UK dropped sharply at the end of 2025, and companies hired fewer workers. Rising costs and economic uncertainty made firms pause hiring, turning to temporary staff instead. Surveys show this drop is the lowest in almost five years. While the government says the economy is improving, manufacturers worry high costs could halt investment. The promise of an industrial strategy is still unclear."
