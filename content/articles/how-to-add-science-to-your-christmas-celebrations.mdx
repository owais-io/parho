summary: "This article shows fun science experiments for Christmas. Try tasting a jellybean with your nose blocked to learn how smell makes flavour. Read crackers jokes aloud to see how laughter grows in groups. Take a turkey carcass apart to see how bones move, or boil it to make a bone puzzle. Make ice‑cream in a bag with salt and ice, and use pine needles to estimate Pi. All simple at home."
