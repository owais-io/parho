title: "India’s 100+ Book Festivals: Why They Exist When Few Read"
summary: "India hosts more than 100 book festivals each year, yet most Indians don’t read for fun. The festivals are big social events, with music, food, handicrafts and celebrity guests, so people come for the fun and the books are just the backdrop. They also try to get kids interested in reading, but many Indians prefer short videos on phones and oral storytelling. The festivals keep books in the public eye, hoping to spark a new reading habit."
