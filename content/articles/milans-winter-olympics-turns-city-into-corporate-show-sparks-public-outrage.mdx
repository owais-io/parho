title: "Milan’s Winter Olympics Turns City into Corporate Show, Sparks Public Outrage"
summary: "Since Milan won the 2026 Olympic bid, the city has become a corporate playground. The opening ceremony felt like a kitschy party, and locals say the Games brought noise, traffic and high costs. Protesters have marched against the sale of public space and rising property prices. Small mountain towns, especially those with the Ladin people, feel left out by the construction. The event has turned into marketing, not sport."
