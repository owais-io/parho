title: "Prediction Market Platforms Face State Lawsuits Over Gambling Status"
summary: "Prediction‑market apps like Kalshi and Polymarket let people bet on anything from sports to political speeches. They call themselves “futures exchanges,” so the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) says only it can regulate them. But many state attorneys general and gaming boards are suing, saying the sites are unlicensed sports‑bets that should be treated like sportsbooks and taxed. With more than a billion dollars traded, the fight could reach the Supreme Court."
