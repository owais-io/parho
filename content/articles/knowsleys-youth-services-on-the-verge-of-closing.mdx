title: "Knowsley's Youth Services on the Verge of Closing"
summary: "In Knowsley, near Liverpool, youth clubs are almost shut because of money cuts. The area has the most gaps in services, low school grades, and no local A‑level options. Centers like Karma in the Community and the long‑running Boyzee run long hours but only have a few months of funding left. Without steady money, kids risk slipping into crime, drugs, and missing out on chances to grow."
