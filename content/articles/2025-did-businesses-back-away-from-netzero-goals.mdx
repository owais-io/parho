title: "2025: Did Businesses Back Away from Net‑Zero Goals?"
summary: "After Donald Trump returned to the White House, many firms began to pull back from their net‑zero pledges, preferring profits over climate action. In the UK, political changes weakened the country’s 2019 carbon‑cutting law, and major retailers and banks slashed their goals. Car makers are delaying electric‑vehicle plans, airlines stick to fossil fuels, and oil companies like BP and Shell are focusing on more oil. Local councils in some areas have also rolled back climate targets."
