title: "House Republicans propose health plan that won’t extend tax credits"
summary: "House Republicans released a new health‑care bill that keeps the expanded tax credits for ACA‑marketplace buyers from ending on Dec. 31. The plan focuses on boosting employer‑sponsored insurance, expanding small‑business “association plans,” and tightening pharmacy benefit managers. It delays cost‑sharing help until 2027 and offers no temporary subsidy. Democrats are pushing for a short‑term extension via discharge petitions, while Trump suggests direct money payments instead. Congress still has to decide."
