title: "Cheap Airport Parking May Steal Your Car"
summary: "Many travellers have found their cars stolen or damaged after using cheap airport parking. A man who paid £109 for a Heathrow meet‑and‑greet deal had his car taken while the company said it was moved by a “security breach.” The company and the comparison website that listed it may not be licensed. Police say companies can set up, but they should meet airport rules. Travelers should read reviews and look for the Park Mark safety logo before booking."
