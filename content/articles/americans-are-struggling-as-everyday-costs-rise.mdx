title: "Americans are struggling as everyday costs rise"
summary: "Prices for food, housing, childcare and health care are climbing, leaving many families feeling squeezed. Trump’s tariffs and big spending have added to inflation, while his promises to cut costs have been slow or half‑meant. Surveys show low consumer confidence and growing disapproval of the president’s handling of the economy. As elections approach, Democrats have won seats by stressing affordability, and Trump has offered a few new, modest ideas that may not be enough."
