title: "Swedish Prime Minister Launches Podcast to Win Voters"
summary: "Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has started a new podcast called Ring statsministern! (Call the prime minister!) on Spotify and YouTube. The show lets ordinary people call in or submit questions about anything from beer habits to crime and the government’s tough‑on‑crime policies. While the podcast aims to give voters a friendly line to the PM, critics say it’s just a polished talking‑point and won’t change his low poll numbers before September’s election."
