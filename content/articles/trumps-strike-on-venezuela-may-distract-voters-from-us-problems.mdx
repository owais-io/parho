title: "Trump’s strike on Venezuela may distract voters from U.S. problems"
summary: "Trump ordered a military strike on Venezuela, but the real issue is how it hurts his image at home. His approval ratings are low on the economy, health care, and immigration. Only about a third of Americans support the attack, and most fear U.S. involvement will keep it in trouble. Critics say the move mainly benefits oil companies and distracts from pressing domestic problems."
