title: "Labour’s popularity is collapsing faster than the economy"
summary: "Labour’s support has collapsed from 34% to 18% in a year, faster than any past government, even though the economy is only average. People are upset about wages, jobs, and rising costs, and the party hasn’t offered a clear plan. Critics say the Bank of England and Treasury are making mistakes, like late interest‑rate cuts. With the next election far off, Labour may be overoptimistic about regaining trust."
