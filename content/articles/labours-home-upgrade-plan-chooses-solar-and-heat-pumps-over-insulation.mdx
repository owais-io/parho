title: "Labour's Home Upgrade Plan Chooses Solar and Heat Pumps Over Insulation"
summary: "Labour’s new £17.5 bn Warm Homes plan gives people £5 bn in grants to add solar panels and batteries, plus loans and green mortgages to help pay for upgrades. The government is moving away from its rule that homes must be fully insulated before installing heat pumps. Instead, it wants to make low‑carbon tech cheaper and easier to buy. The plan also drops the gas‑boiler ban set for 2035, sparking worries that boilers will stay in homes for decades."
