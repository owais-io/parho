title: "Trump advisers explain a possible U.S. attack on Iran"
summary: "President Trump says Iran can build missiles that could reach the U.S., but intelligence says that would take a decade or more. His advisers try to back him up while avoiding direct contradictions. The White House has also claimed to have stopped Iran’s nuclear program, yet still warns of future threats. Iran holds a large missile stash that could hit U.S. and Israeli targets. A war would deplete U.S. interceptor stocks and strain regional defenses."
