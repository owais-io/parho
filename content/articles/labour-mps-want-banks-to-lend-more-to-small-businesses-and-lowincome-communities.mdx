title: "Labour MPs want banks to lend more to small businesses and low‑income communities"
summary: "Labour backbenchers have drafted a bill that would force UK banks to make more affordable loans for small businesses and people in low‑income neighbourhoods. Inspired by the US Community Reinvestment Act, the law would require banks to report how well they serve poorer communities, be rated on it, and help credit unions and local finance groups. The Treasury has a strategy, but critics say it lacks teeth. The bill faces a long way to pass."
