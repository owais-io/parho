title: "Will other countries copy Australia’s under‑16 social media ban?"
summary: "Australia has made it illegal for people under 16 to use social‑media apps, and other governments are watching. Denmark, Norway, Ireland, Spain and France are drafting similar rules, while the EU issued a call for bans. In the UK, the government is still studying the idea, and several U.S. states have passed laws that limit or require consent for young users. Tech firms face pressure to make safer products, but critics worry a ban alone won’t fix all problems."
