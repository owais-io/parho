summary: "Australia’s inflation slowed to 3.4% in November, below the 3.6% many expected. Because of the drop, economists think the Reserve Bank may hold off on a February rate hike, but the possibility of a rate rise remains. The Australian dollar slipped and the ASX 200 edged up after the news. Prices for clothing, furniture and holidays fell, while housing and food costs rose. Analysts warn rates could still climb in 2026 to curb inflation."
