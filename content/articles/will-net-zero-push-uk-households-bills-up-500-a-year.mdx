title: "Will Net Zero Push UK Households' Bills Up £500 a Year?"
summary: "Neso, Britain’s energy watchdog, has modelled how much it will cost to reach net zero by 2050. The most ambitious plan could hit £460 bn in 2029, then fall to about £220 bn a year by 2050 – still high for a few years. Some say a slower path saves £500 a year per household, but the money comes from many services. Early investment is costly, but later savings and other benefits make it worthwhile."
