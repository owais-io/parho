title: "Cow Uses Broom to Scratch Itself, Prompting Scientists to Rethink Cattle Intelligence"
summary: "Scientists in Austria discovered that a 13‑year‑old cow named Veronika can use a broom as a tool to reach hard‑to‑scratch spots. A farmer first noticed her playing with sticks, and researchers later filmed her picking up a broom, moving it with her tongue, and using the bristles or handle for different areas. The study suggests cattle may be smarter and more inventive than we thought, showing we may have underestimated animal intelligence."
