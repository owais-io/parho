title: "How to Revive Britain’s High Streets"
summary: "Letters to the Guardian argue that Britain’s high streets need a new plan. Suggestions include fixing business rates, adding a tax on online sales, keeping rents reasonable, and letting local councils buy empty shops. They propose turning vacant storefronts into community hubs with cafés, play areas, and craft classes, improving public transport, and encouraging local businesses. The goal is to make town centres welcoming, affordable, and useful for everyone."
