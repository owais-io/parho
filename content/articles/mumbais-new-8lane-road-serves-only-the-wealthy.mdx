title: "Mumbai’s new 8‑lane road serves only the wealthy"
summary: "Mumbai has opened a fast, 8‑lane motorway built on land reclaimed from the sea. It cuts travel time from 45 to 10 minutes for cars, but most of the city’s 22 million people use overcrowded buses and trains. Critics say the road is a luxury for the rich, while ignoring the need for better public transport. It also harms mangroves, displaces local fishers, and gives developers cheap land for expensive apartments."
