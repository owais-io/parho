title: "Are at‑home gut tests useful or a waste?"
summary: "People can send a stool sample to a lab for a few hundred dollars and get a report about food sensitivities, pathogens and gut bacteria. Influencers pitch these kits as a way to “hack” health, but doctors say the results are hard to interpret. Most people get no clear benefit, and the tests can even cause worry. Only a few specialists can use the data properly. A balanced diet is the best way to support gut health."
