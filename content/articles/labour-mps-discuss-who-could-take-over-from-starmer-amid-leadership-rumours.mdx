title: "Labour MPs Discuss Who Could Take Over from Starmer Amid Leadership Rumours"
summary: "Labour MPs are busy chatting about who might replace Keir Starmer as the party’s leader while the news keeps buzzing with rumours. Starmer is under pressure after poor polling and internal friction, but he says he’ll stay on. No clear plan exists for a challenge – no letters to the 1922 Committee, no obvious candidate – so MPs just speculate. The party’s leadership war is more gossip than real moves."
