title: "Solar Geoengineering May Not Fix Climate Crisis"
summary: "Solar geoengineering, or SAI, injects particles into the stratosphere to lower Earth’s temperature. The idea is that a smaller global temperature will cut climate damage, but experts warn it does not solve the root problem—greenhouse gas emissions. Plus, changing the sky can shift weather patterns, possibly making storms, monsoons, or El Niño more unpredictable. The article argues we should focus on cutting emissions, not adding more particles to the air."
