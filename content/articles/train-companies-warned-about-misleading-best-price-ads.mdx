title: "Train companies warned about misleading “best price” ads"
summary: "The advertising watchdog said that three train sellers – ScotRail, Greater Anglia and a site called My Train Ticket – were lying about offering the cheapest tickets. The ASA found they had no proof that their prices were always lower than competitors. The decision follows a similar ruling against Trainline. The companies have changed their wording and will review their practices to keep claims honest. The government plans a new national ticket site to fix the confusing fare system."
