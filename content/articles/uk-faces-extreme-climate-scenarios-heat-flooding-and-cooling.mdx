title: "UK faces extreme climate scenarios: heat, flooding, and cooling"
summary: "Scientists have shown the UK could face very bad climate changes. One scenario says temperatures could rise by 4°C and sea level could go up about 2 metres. Another scary idea is that the big Atlantic ocean current could shut down, causing the UK to cool by 6°C, messing up food and energy. These extreme situations could flood towns, hurt farms, and require new buildings and drainage. The study helps planners prepare for worst‑case events."
