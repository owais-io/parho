title: "US to fund controversial $1.6 m hepatitis B vaccine study in Africa"
summary: "The US is giving $1.6 million to run a study in Guinea‑Bissau that will test if giving newborns a hepatitis B shot at birth is safe. Many scientists say the plan is wrong because the vaccine is already proven safe and effective. They worry the trial could harm children and damage trust in U.S. science. The study will compare babies who get the shot with those who don’t and measure health outcomes."
