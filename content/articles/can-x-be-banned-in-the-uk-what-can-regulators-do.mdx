title: "Can X be banned in the UK? What can regulators do?"
summary: "The UK government is threatening to ban Elon Musk’s platform X if it fails to stop illegal content, such as AI‑generated porn. Ofcom is investigating X for breaches of the Online Safety Act, like not removing illegal material fast enough and putting children at risk. If violations are found, Ofcom could block the site, fine it up to 10% of global revenue, or force policy changes. The probe could take six to nine months, though a quick ban is possible."
