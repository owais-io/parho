title: "Why the Gorton and Denton by‑election matters for Labour"
summary: "People in Gorton and Denton are watching a by‑election that could change Labour’s standing. The seat, a Labour stronghold for decades, is now a three‑way race with Reform UK and the Greens. A win for Labour would calm the party’s leadership, while a loss could blame Keir Starmer for blocking Andy Burnham’s local run. Local voters, many from ethnic minorities, are split over who best stops the far‑right, making the result highly contested."
