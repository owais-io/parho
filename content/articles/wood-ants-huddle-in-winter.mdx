title: "Wood Ants Huddle in Winter"
summary: "We woke up early in a cold, quiet forest. While walking with our dog, we found a big mound of soil – a wood ant nest. In winter the ants sleep at the bottom, huddling to stay warm, like penguins. I saw a few ants moving, maybe the sunrise woke them up. Wood ants are among the UK's biggest ants and spray a fish‑chip scent if disturbed."
