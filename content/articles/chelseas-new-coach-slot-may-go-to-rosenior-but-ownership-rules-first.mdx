title: "Chelsea’s new coach slot may go to Rosenior, but ownership rules first"
summary: "Rosenior, who is currently coaching Strasbourg, is being eyed to replace Enzo Maresca at Chelsea. The move depends on BlueCo, the shared owner of both clubs, which wants to protect interests at both sides. Until a new Strasbourg coach is appointed, Rosenior may stay. He’s had offers from other clubs but prefers the current job, and Chelsea already see him as a long‑term successor, though they have backup options."
