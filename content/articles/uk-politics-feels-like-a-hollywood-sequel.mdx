title: "UK Politics Feels Like a Hollywood Sequel"
summary: "Guardians column points out that British politics behaves like Hollywood sequels: new budgets and campaigns keep repeating old ideas instead of trying something new. Labour’s finance chief, Rachel Reeves, and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch both use familiar slogans and old arguments, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer sticks to an old playbook with little fresh policy. The result is a sense that the country is trying to protect the past rather than build a better future."
