title: "Polar Bears May Adapt to Warming, New Study Says"
summary: "Researchers found that polar bears in southeastern Greenland are changing the way certain genes work in response to rising temperatures. The study looked at tiny “jumping genes” that can switch other genes on or off. These genetic shifts could help bears cope with warmer weather and a diet that’s shifting from seal fat to more plant material. While it offers hope, scientists warn that stopping climate change is still urgent."
