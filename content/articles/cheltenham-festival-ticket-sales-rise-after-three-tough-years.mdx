title: "Cheltenham festival ticket sales rise after three tough years"
summary: "Cheltenham festival is seeing a bounce‑back in ticket sales after three years. New chief executive Guy Lavender says the track has made a series of changes—bringing back a Ladies’ Day, easing alcohol rules, and teaming up with a travel firm to lower accommodation costs—that are paying off. Ticket sales are higher than a year ago, and organisers expect more people to come to next month’s big meeting. The race programme still has plenty of favourites and surprises."
