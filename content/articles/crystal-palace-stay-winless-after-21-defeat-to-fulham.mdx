title: "Crystal Palace stay winless after 2‑1 defeat to Fulham"
summary: "Crystal Palace were beaten 2‑1 by Fulham, keeping their winless run alive. The first goal came from Jean‑Philippe Mateta, but Fulham equalised late through Tom Cairney. Palace coach Oliver Glasner was unhappy, saying his side are in “survival mode” after another draw. The team still need a striker, so they are looking to sign Brennan Johnson from Tottenham and have already shown interest in Sidiki Cherif, and hopes to strengthen the attack."
