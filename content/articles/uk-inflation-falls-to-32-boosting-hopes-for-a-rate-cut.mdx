title: "UK inflation falls to 3.2%, boosting hopes for a rate cut"
summary: "The UK’s annual inflation rate fell to 3.2% in November, the lowest since March, thanks to lower food prices. The drop makes an interest‑rate cut by the Bank of England likely, with markets now betting on a move from 4% to 3.75%. Oil prices are up after a U.S. blockade order, while Christmas food costs have risen sharply. The budget focused on cutting bills, and workers’ unions say more cuts are needed to ease living costs."
