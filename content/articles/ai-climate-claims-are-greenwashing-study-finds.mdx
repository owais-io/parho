title: "AI Climate Claims Are Greenwashing, Study Finds"
summary: "A new report says tech firms that say AI will cut greenhouse gas emissions are mainly greenwashing. The study looked at 154 statements and found no real evidence that generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot lower emissions. Most claims rely on weak or no evidence, and the energy used by data centers dwarfs any small benefits. The paper calls for honest climate talk from the industry."
