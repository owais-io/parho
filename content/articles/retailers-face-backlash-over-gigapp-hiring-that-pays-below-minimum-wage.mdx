summary: "Retailers are under fire for using the gig‑app Temper to hire staff for jobs like shop assistants, baristas and warehouse workers, but many of those workers are earning less than the legal minimum after the app’s fee. The TUC says the app lets companies treat employees as self‑employed, cutting out sick pay, breaks and other rights. The criticism follows other chains that stopped using similar apps."
