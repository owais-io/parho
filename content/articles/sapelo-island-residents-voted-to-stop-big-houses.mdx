title: "Sapelo Island Residents Voted to Stop Big Houses"
summary: "In southern Georgia’s Sapelo Island, a small community of Gullah Geechee people – descendants of enslaved Africans – fought a county vote to stop larger homes from being built on their land. About 1,800 voters turned out, and 85% rejected a plan that would have doubled the maximum house size. The win keeps the island’s homes small, protects its unique ecology, and helps the few remaining residents stay in their ancestral home."
