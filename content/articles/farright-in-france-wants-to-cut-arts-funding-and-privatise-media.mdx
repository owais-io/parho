title: "Far‑Right in France Wants to Cut Arts Funding and Privatise Media"
summary: "Marine Le Pen’s National Rally plans to shut down France’s film subsidy agency, the CNC, and stop money for contemporary arts. The party would also privatise public broadcasters, giving media control to wealthy owners. They want to focus on historic sites and “heritage” while rejecting modern art and LGBTQ‑friendly festivals. If the RN wins, France’s lively, independent art scene could be stifled and media become more right‑leaning."
