title: "New England is Heating Up Faster Than Most Places on Earth"
summary: "A new study shows that New England has warmed by about 2.5 °C since 1900, which is almost double the global average. The region’s temperatures, especially at night and in winter, are rising faster than any other U.S. area except Alaska. Changes in the nearby ocean and the slowing Gulf Stream are helping trap and release heat. This rapid warming threatens snow sports, maple syrup production, and the area’s cold‑winter traditions."
