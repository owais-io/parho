title: "UK Will Spend £200m to Get Soldiers Ready for a Possible Ukraine Deployment"
summary: "Britain will put £200m into getting its soldiers ready to go to Ukraine if a cease‑fire forces a joint force there. The money will buy better vehicles, new communication gear, drone‑defence kits and help troops train for a quick move. The announcement comes after Russia launched a huge drone and missile attack on Kyiv, using a new very‑fast missile that rattled Europe’s leaders. Ukraine, its allies and the UN have condemned the strike and are calling for a stronger response."
