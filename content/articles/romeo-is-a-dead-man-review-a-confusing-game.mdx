title: "Romeo Is a Dead Man Review: A Confusing Game"
summary: "Suda51, the Japanese director known for quirky titles like No More Heroes, released a new game after ten years. It starts with a cartoon, then throws a story about a zombie‑like hero, the FBI’s police, and a character named Juliet who pops up in different dimensions. The combat feels stylish, but the game keeps losing pace, glitches on the PS5 Pro, and the plot never makes sense. In short, the visual flair isn’t enough to save a confusing adventure."
