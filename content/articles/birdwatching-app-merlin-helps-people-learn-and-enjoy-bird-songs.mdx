title: "Bird‑watching app Merlin helps people learn and enjoy bird songs"
summary: "A free app called Merlin lets anyone record a bird’s song and tells you what species it is. It’s become wildly popular – with over 33 million downloads worldwide and 1.5 million users in Britain alone. The app uses AI to match recordings with more than 1,300 bird species. Many beginners find it a handy teacher, and it even offers a calming, nature‑based break for people with anxiety. It’s not perfect – sometimes it misidentifies calls – but most users say it brings birds into everyday life."
