title: "US House brings back ACA health subsidies after Republican support"
summary: "The House passed a bill to restore tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans for three years. The credits, which lower insurance costs, had expired last year. All Democrats voted for the bill, and 17 moderate Republicans joined them, breaking with President Trump who opposed the subsidies. The bill still needs Senate approval. Without the credits, ACA members could see premiums rise almost double, prompting Republicans to seek a revised deal in the Senate."
