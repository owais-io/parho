title: "Job Ads Exclude Working-Class Students Like My Son"
summary: "The letter shows how the writer’s 21‑year‑old biochemistry student, who grew up in a working‑class family, faces job ads that ask for the family’s postcode, job titles and education—questions that exclude him because he went to a selective grammar school. He argues class should be a protected characteristic but says we need a clear definition and a rethink of secondary schooling. It notes the decline of working‑class people in senior jobs, hinting the education system needs radical change."
