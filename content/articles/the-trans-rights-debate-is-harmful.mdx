title: "The Trans Rights Debate Is Harmful"
summary: "The Supreme Court decided that “sex” means biological sex, which changes how single‑sex clubs, toilets and other spaces are run. The author explains the confusion over the ruling, quoting a judge who says women‑only places can exclude trans women, and the Equality Commission, which worries it would become mixed‑sex. He argues we should use a broad, friendly interpretation that lets trans people join normal groups and keeps the debate from hurting everyone."
