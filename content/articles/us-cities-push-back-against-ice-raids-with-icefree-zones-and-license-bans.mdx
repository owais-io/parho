summary: "Across the US, cities are fighting back against ICE raids. They’re making “ICE‑free” zones in hospitals, parks and other public places so residents can feel safe. Local officials are also making it easier to sue ICE agents after incidents like Minneapolis shootings. Some towns have stopped selling warehouses that ICE wants to turn into jails, and others are cutting contracts with companies and parking garages that work with ICE. Even liquor licences are being withheld from hotels that host ICE agents."
