title: "Will Jacks May Replace Injured Bowler in England's Day‑Night Ashes Test"
summary: "England are deciding who will bowl in the second Ashes Test under lights after pace bowler Mark Wood has injured his knee. Will Jacks, an all‑rounder who usually plays one‑day cricket, could be chosen, but they could also go with new‑comer Josh Tongue or spinner Shoaib Bashir. Jacks has been practising longer, showing he can bat lower down and bowl more overs. The team wants to use the pink ball’s softer feel to keep the Australian batsmen in trouble."
