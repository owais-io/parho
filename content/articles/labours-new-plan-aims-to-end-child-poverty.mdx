title: "Labour’s New Plan Aims to End Child Poverty"
summary: "Labour has rolled out a big plan to cut child poverty, starting with ending the two‑child benefit cap. The government says it can lift about 550,000 children above the poverty line by 2030, though 4 million will still need help. The strategy includes better housing, health, transport and school support, and will be updated yearly. Some critics say the plan is too slow and that many working families still struggle, but supporters say it’s a fresh start."
