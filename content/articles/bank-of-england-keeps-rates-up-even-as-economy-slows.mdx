title: "Bank of England keeps rates up even as economy slows"
summary: "The Bank of England decided to keep interest rates at 3.75% even though jobs are slipping and price rises are easing. The monetary policy committee was almost split; most members said a cut would help the economy, but Governor Andrew Bailey used his deciding vote to hold rates. The bank expects inflation to fall to the 2% target soon, and growth to stay low at about 0.9%. A rate cut is still likely in March."
