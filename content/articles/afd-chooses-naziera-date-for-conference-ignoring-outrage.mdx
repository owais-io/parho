title: "AfD Chooses Nazi‑Era Date for Conference, Ignoring Outrage"
summary: "The German far‑right party AfD is holding its July conference in Erfurt on the 100‑year anniversary of a 1926 Nazi rally. The timing seems deliberate, hinting at a connection to Hitler without openly saying so. Politicians and historians have condemned the move, but the party’s support remains strong, especially in Thuringia and East Germany. Polls show the AfD could win a state government, showing that outrage alone won’t stop its rise."
