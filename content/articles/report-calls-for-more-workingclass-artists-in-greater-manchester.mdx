title: "Report Calls for More Working‑Class Artists in Greater Manchester"
summary: "A new report says Greater Manchester should make it easier for working‑class people to join the arts. It gives 21 ideas, like treating class like race or gender and creating a “Class Champion” to speak up for those from low‑income backgrounds. The report also points out that almost no new apprenticeships are available in creative jobs and that the Co‑op is offering money to add 200 new spots. If put into action, it could open doors for many more artists."
