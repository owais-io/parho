title: "Australia Bans Social Media for Kids Under 16 – Why It Matters"
summary: "Australia made history by banning social‑media apps for anyone under 16. The move shows that companies like Facebook and TikTok haven’t protected teens well enough on their own. The law forces them to add strict age checks, limit “addictive” feeds and let parents control accounts. Other countries, like the UK and California, are watching to see if bans or limits help. Critics worry teens will find ways around it, but the change may spark long‑term safer rules for everyone."
