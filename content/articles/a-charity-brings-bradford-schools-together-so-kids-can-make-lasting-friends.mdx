title: "A charity brings Bradford schools together so kids can make lasting friends"
summary: "In Bradford, a charity called The Linking Network pairs children from two very different primary schools. Sixty kids—some from a multicultural, low‑income school and others from a mainly white, affluent one—first chat online and then meet in the city hall. Over a year they visit each other’s classrooms, share games and stories, and learn to respect differences. The programme builds empathy that lasts a lifetime and has spread to 26 counties."
