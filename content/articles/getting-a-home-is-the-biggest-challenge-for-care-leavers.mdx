title: "Getting a home is the biggest challenge for care leavers"
summary: "While the government’s free eye tests for care leavers are a positive step, the biggest issue is that many will be homeless within two years of leaving care. Thousands of young people exit care before they’re ready, losing vital support. They often end up in unsafe B&Bs or hostels, struggling with bills while trying to study or work. The government must stop the “care cliff” and give comprehensive help with housing, health, school, jobs, and money."
