title: "Trump Claims to Be a Peacemaker, But His Deals Don’t Deliver Real Peace"
summary: "Trump says he’s helped end fights in Rwanda, Thailand‑Cambodia, and Gaza, but real‑world events show the opposite. While he signs papers, clashes resume and promises are broken. Experts point out that true peace requires fixing deep problems, not just swapping contracts. Trump’s style is like a business deal—quick, self‑focused, and often unreliable—so the peace he offers feels fragile and short‑lived."
