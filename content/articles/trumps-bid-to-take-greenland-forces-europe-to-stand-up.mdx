title: "Trump’s Bid to Take Greenland Forces Europe to Stand Up"
summary: "Donald Trump has asked Denmark to hand over Greenland, sparking a crisis that could split the NATO alliance. European leaders have largely complied with his demands for higher defence spending and have stayed silent on US actions abroad, but Greenland’s owners fear U.S. annexation. Denmark’s foreign minister says Europe must protect its sovereignty, with NATO troops already posted on the island. The debate shows how Trump’s ego and security worries threaten trans‑Atlantic unity."
