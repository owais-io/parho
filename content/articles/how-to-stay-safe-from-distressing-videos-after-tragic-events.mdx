summary: "After the Bondi attack, many people looked online for details. Seeing graphic footage can stick in your mind, causing bad sleep, nightmares, anger, and panic. We don’t need to watch every video to understand what happened. Reduce exposure, especially for kids, and use calming activities like nature walks, breathing exercises, or playing a game to distract the brain. Talk about your feelings, reach out for help, and remember support lines are available if distress gets too strong."
