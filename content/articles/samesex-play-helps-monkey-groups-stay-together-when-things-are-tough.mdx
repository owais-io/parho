title: "Same‑sex play helps monkey groups stay together when things are tough"
summary: "Scientists studied same‑sex behavior in 59 species of monkeys and apes, including chimpanzees and gorillas. They found it is common in groups that live in dry places where food is scarce and danger is high. The behavior helps animals bond, lower tension and keep the group stable. It appears linked to lifespans, size differences between sexes, and complex social hierarchies. Researchers say the findings explain why such behavior is widespread, but they warn against applying it to humans."
