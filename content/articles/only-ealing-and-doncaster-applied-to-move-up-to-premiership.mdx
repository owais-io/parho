title: "Only Ealing and Doncaster Applied to Move Up to Premiership"
summary: "Only Ealing Trailfinders and Doncaster Knights have applied to move from the Championship to the Premiership this season. Worcester Warriors missed the deadline because of debts. Ealing hasn’t met the Premiership’s ground requirements, and Doncaster finished 10th. The proposed playoff that would let the winner earn a spot against a Premiership team is now in doubt. The Premiership is also moving toward a closed franchise league with no relegation and plans to grow from 10 to 12 teams by 2030."
