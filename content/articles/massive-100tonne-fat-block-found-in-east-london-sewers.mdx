title: "Massive 100‑tonne fat block found in east London sewers"
summary: "A 100‑tonne fatberg has been found blocking drains in Whitechapel, east London. It’s made of fats, oils, grease and wipes, stretches about 100 metres and is larger than a battle tank. Thames Water says the problem happens when people pour grease or flush wipes, and clearing the blockage costs millions of pounds each year. They warn that December and January see more blockages and the company spent £2.1 million clearing them this season. To help, they advise scraping food scraps, using strainer plugs, and not pouring gravy, cream or other liquid foods down the sink. The fatberg will need to be broken up by workers and the waste sent to a special facility."
