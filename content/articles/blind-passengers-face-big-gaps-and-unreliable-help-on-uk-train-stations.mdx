title: "Blind Passengers Face Big Gaps and Unreliable Help on UK Train Stations"
summary: "In a recent survey, four out of five blind and partially sighted people in the UK have trouble crossing the gap between trains and platforms. Some even fall or get stuck. The study shows that only a few stations use raised bumps and clear colours to guide them, and most get bad or no help from staff or passenger‑assistance services. Many are scared to travel alone. The government wants to fix these problems under a new rail bill."
