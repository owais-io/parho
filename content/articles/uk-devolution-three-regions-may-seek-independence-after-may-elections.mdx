title: "UK Devolution: Three Regions May Seek Independence After May Elections"
summary: "After the May elections, polls show that the SNP will likely win the Scottish Parliament, Plaid Cymru could become the largest party in Wales, and the Welsh Green Party may also secure seats – all parties favour independence. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin already holds the most seats. The article argues that many voters are tired of a centralised UK that doesn’t fit Wales, Scotland or NI, and calls for deeper devolution reforms so each country can govern itself better."
