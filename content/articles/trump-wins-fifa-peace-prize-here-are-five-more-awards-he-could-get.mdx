title: "Trump Wins FIFA Peace Prize – Here Are Five More Awards He Could Get"
summary: "Trump was handed a strange FIFA peace prize, a joke that many think shows how far he’s gone. In the column, the writer laughs and then lists five absurd awards he could also win: a Volkswagen “Golf” trophy for his love of golf, a cheese award for his dislike of France, a Humpty Dumpty prize for his word‑play, a battery‑themed Energizer award, and a gas‑light medal. It’s a satirical take on Trump’s ego and the odd honors he’s getting."
