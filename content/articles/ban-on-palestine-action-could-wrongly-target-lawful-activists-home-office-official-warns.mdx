title: "Ban on Palestine Action Could Wrongly Target Lawful Activists, Home Office Official Warns"
summary: "Officials from the Home Office have warned that the new ban on the group Palestine Action could cause the counter‑terrorism programme called Prevent to get overwhelmed and wrongly target people who simply support Palestinian rights. Because being a member of or showing support for Palestine Action is now illegal, police, schools and hospitals might mistakenly flag ordinary activists. A legal challenge to the ban is coming, and the Home Office says supporting Palestine is still lawful."
