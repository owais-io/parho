title: "Tiny Monsters in Moss: A Micro‑World Under the Microscope"
summary: "After a hot drought, a wall‑top moss that had looked brown came back green when it rained. The author takes a sample to a microscope and finds tiny animals—tardigrades, rotifers, and other microscopic creatures. These tiny “monsters” live in the moss’s wet cushions and are part of a hidden rainforest that only shows itself under a lens. It’s a reminder of the small world around us."
