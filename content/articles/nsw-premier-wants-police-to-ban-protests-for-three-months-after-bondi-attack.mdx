title: "NSW Premier Wants Police to Ban Protests for Three Months After Bondi Attack"
summary: "The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has asked the state parliament to give police the power to ban protests for up to three months, saying they could be linked to the recent Bondi beach attack that killed 15 people. The plan would let police declare areas where no public gatherings are allowed, even without court approval. Critics, including Jewish and pro‑Palestine groups, say the move unfairly targets peaceful demonstrations and risks abuse of power."
