title: "Jordan Mass Grave Confirms First Pandemic"
summary: "Researchers found a mass burial in Jordan that proves the first recorded pandemic, the Justinian Plague, really did kill huge numbers of people. DNA from the bodies shows the victims were a mix of men, women, young and old, many of whom were travellers. The study links the disease to the city’s busy trade life, showing how the outbreak stuck people together in a way similar to Covid’s lockdowns. It gives a human story behind ancient pandemics."
