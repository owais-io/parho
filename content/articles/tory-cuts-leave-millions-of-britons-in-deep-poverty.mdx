title: "Tory cuts leave millions of Britons in deep poverty"
summary: "A new report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that Conservative governments have done nothing to reduce poverty in the UK. One in five people live in relative poverty, 6.8 million struggle on far‑below‑average incomes and 3.8 million are destitute. The article argues that welfare cuts meant to free money for defence have made life harder for the poorest, and calls on the Labour government to reverse this trend before the next election."
