title: "Queensland Mine Expansion Approved, Scientists Warn of Wildlife Loss"
summary: "The Australian government approved a 24‑year expansion of Queensland’s Middlemount coal mine, allowing 85 million tonnes of coal to be exported. Scientists say the project will release 236 million tonnes of CO₂ and clear 81 ha of greater glider habitat and 183 ha of koala habitat. Ecologists warn that relocating tree hollows is ineffective and many gliders will die. Critics call the approval a step back for wildlife and climate policy."
