title: "Plug‑in hybrids use far more fuel than manufacturers claim"
summary: "Fraunhofer researchers looked at data from around a million plug‑in hybrid cars and found they use about six litres of fuel per 100 km in real life, not the 1‑2 litres manufacturers advertise. The study shows the engines turn on much more often than expected, especially in high‑end models like Porsche. Cheaper hybrids from brands like Kia and Toyota stay closer to the advertised figures. The researchers say the EU should use these real‑world numbers to set stricter fuel‑use rules."
