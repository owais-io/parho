title: "Scientists Plan to Film a Black Hole in Action"
summary: "Scientists using the Event Horizon Telescope will take a series of images of the super‑massive black hole at the centre of galaxy M87 over March and April, stitching them into the first ever movie of a black hole in action. The footage will let researchers measure the hole’s spin and study the powerful jets it launches, which shape galaxies. The huge data set will be processed later, so the public will see the results only after months."
