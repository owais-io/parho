title: "Pitcher Plant Uses Sweet Nectar to Poison Ants"
summary: "A carnivorous pitcher plant in Southeast Asia has discovered a clever way to catch ants: it drips sweet nectar that actually contains a nerve‑toxin called isoshinanolone. The toxin slows the ants’ muscles, makes them groom excessively and eventually spasm and fall into the trap. The nectar also has sugars that keep the rim slippery, so ants slide right in. The plant digests the ants to feed itself in nutrient‑poor soil."
