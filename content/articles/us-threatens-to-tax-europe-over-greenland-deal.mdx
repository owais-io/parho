title: "US Threatens to Tax Europe Over Greenland Deal"
summary: "The US announced it will impose 10‑25% tariffs on eight European countries unless they allow the US to buy Greenland. The threat rattles the long‑standing US‑Europe security and trade ties. European leaders could use the EU’s Anti‑Coercion Instrument, but many argue the crisis forces Europe to build stronger, independent defence and industry. The situation signals a widening gap between US pressure and European unity."
