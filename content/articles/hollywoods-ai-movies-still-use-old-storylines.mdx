title: "Hollywood’s AI Movies Still Use Old Storylines"
summary: "Hollywood has made AI movies for decades, and new films still rely on familiar tropes like robots as villains or mysterious machines. The latest release, “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die” from Gore Verbinski, shows a chaotic, game‑like world where an AI forces people into a cosmic escape room. It’s flashy and fast‑cut, but it’s not a deep look at what real AI can do, highlighting Hollywood’s slow shift in AI storytelling."
