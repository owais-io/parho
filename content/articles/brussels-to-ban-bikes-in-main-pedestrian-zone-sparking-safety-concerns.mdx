title: "Brussels to ban bikes in main pedestrian zone, sparking safety concerns"
summary: "Brussels will limit bikes and scooters to a narrow window (4 am–11 am) in its main pedestrian zone. After that, riders must walk their bikes or face a fine. City officials say the ban is needed because many cyclists ignore speed limits and cause conflicts, especially with older people and families. However, local cyclists argue the plan is unsafe and that the proposed alternate route is too dangerous, sparking a safety debate."
