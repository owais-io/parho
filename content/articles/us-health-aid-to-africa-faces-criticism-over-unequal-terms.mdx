title: "US Health Aid to Africa Faces Criticism Over Unequal Terms"
summary: "The US is offering Africa $11.3 bn in health aid, but deals come with strict conditions. Zimbabwe stopped talks because the agreement would force it to share sensitive health data and give the US control over drugs and technology. Other countries worry about handing over data, letting the US set rules, and tying aid to political or religious demands. Critics say the deals turn aid into a way for the US to gain power on the continent."
