title: "Hate and sexual AI videos on TikTok attract billions of views"
summary: "Researchers found 354 TikTok accounts using AI tools to post 43,000 videos that earned 4.5 billion views in a month. Many of the posts are hateful, anti‑immigrant, or sexualised—especially of women—and most of the videos have no AI label, so they look like normal content. TikTok says the findings are unverified, but it is working to label AI posts and limit bot accounts. Experts say the platform should separate AI‑made videos from human ones."
