title: "Seeing Monks Walk for Peace Across America"
summary: "A Buddhist monk group is walking across the country for peace. Their slow, 20‑mile‑a‑day trek from Texas to Washington shows a quiet form of protest. I drove over two hours to meet them in North Carolina. Watching the monks pass—clad in orange robes, carrying flowers—taught me about loving‑kindness and community. Their message of unity reminds us that small acts can build peace."
