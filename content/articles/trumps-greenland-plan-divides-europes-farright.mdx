title: "Trump’s Greenland Plan Divides Europe’s Far‑Right"
summary: "President Donald Trump tried to pressure Greenland into becoming part of the U.S., a move that shocked many of his far‑right friends in Europe. His comment that NATO troops were “off‑frontline” in Afghanistan angered European leaders who see them as allies. The push caused far‑right parties in France, Germany, Italy and Spain to rethink their support for Trump, some even calling him an enemy of Europe. The tension shows how Trump’s expansionist ideas clash with European sovereignty concerns."
