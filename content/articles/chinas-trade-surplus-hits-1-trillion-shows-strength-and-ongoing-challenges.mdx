title: "China’s Trade Surplus Hits $1 Trillion – Shows Strength and Ongoing Challenges"
summary: "China’s exports have pushed its trade surplus past $1 trillion this year, proving how much the country still relies on selling goods abroad. U.S. imports fell after trade tensions, but many Chinese products now go through other countries like Indonesia before reaching America, keeping the trade flow alive. China’s exports grew 5.4%, with high‑tech items like batteries and chips rising even more. Beijing wants to boost domestic spending, but Chinese families still save more than Americans, so shifting the economy will be hard."
