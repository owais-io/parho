title: "US $2 Billion Aid Package Forces UN to Follow Washington’s Rules, Experts Warn"
summary: "The US has pledged $2 billion for humanitarian aid, but it comes with strict rules. UN agencies must channel the money through a single fund and only spend it in 17 countries chosen by Washington, leaving out places like Afghanistan and Yemen. Aid experts say this will make the UN more controlled by the U.S. and less flexible, and that the amount may be too small to matter."
