title: "Salt‑Tolerant Plants Could Save Coastal Farms"
summary: "In Venice’s salty lagoons, farmers are seeing more salt in the soil because of rising seas and warmer weather. Traditional crops like tomatoes can’t handle the salt, so scientists are turning to halophytes—plants that grow in salty water. These plants, such as marsh samphire and glasswort, can be grown next to tomatoes to improve soil and give farmers a new, tasty crop. Chefs are using the herbs in pizzas and sorbets, turning a weed into a delicacy."
