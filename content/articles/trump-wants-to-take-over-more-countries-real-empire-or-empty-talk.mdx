title: "Trump Wants to Take Over More Countries: Real Empire or Empty Talk?"
summary: "Trump says the U.S. will control Venezuela and could soon grab Cuba, Colombia, even Greenland. He’s revived the old Monroe doctrine as his “Donroe doctrine,” claiming America must police the Americas and grab valuable resources. Critics say this is just the old U.S. imperial play, now more blunt. The move follows Russia’s and China’s own expansionist moves, raising worries about a new scramble for power in the world."
