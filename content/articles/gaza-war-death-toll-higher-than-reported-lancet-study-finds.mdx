title: "Gaza War Death Toll Higher Than Reported, Lancet Study Finds"
summary: "A new Lancet study says about 75,000 people were killed in Gaza’s war, far more than the roughly 50,000 figures the authorities gave. The research, based on a survey of 2,000 families, counted 42,200 women, children and elderly deaths—over half of all casualties. It also estimates that 8,200 deaths were indirect, from things like disease and malnutrition. The findings suggest the real toll is higher than reported."
