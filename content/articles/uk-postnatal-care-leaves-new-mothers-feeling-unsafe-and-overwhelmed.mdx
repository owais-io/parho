title: "UK postnatal care leaves new mothers feeling unsafe and overwhelmed"
summary: "New mothers in the UK feel unsafe and alone after giving birth because post‑natal care is badly underfunded and understaffed. A report from the National Childbirth Trust, based on 2,000 parents, found 24 % had no regular NHS contact and 87 % felt overwhelmed. Many also felt lonely and worried about mental health. The government says it will invest more money, staff and training, and launch a national review to fix the gaps."
