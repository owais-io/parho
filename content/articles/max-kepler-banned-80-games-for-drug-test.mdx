title: "Max Kepler banned 80 games for drug test"
summary: "Free‑agent outfielder Max Kepler has been suspended for 80 games after a positive drug test. He tested positive for a banned steroid metabolite, so he can’t play if he signs in 2026. The ban is a standard first‑offence penalty, meaning no games and no pay. The decision came even though he isn’t signed to a team yet, and the league hasn’t said if he will appeal."
