title: "Wieambilla shooter's delusions, not terrorism, found by coroner"
summary: "Queensland's coroner found that the three people behind the 2022 Wieambilla shootings were not terrorists. They killed two police officers and a neighbour because of shared delusions that they were being persecuted. The officers’ guns were weaker than the rifles the shooters had. The report also suggests the state should check mental health for anyone with a gun licence. Families were disappointed with some recommendations."
