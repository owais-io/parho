title: "Russia Exploits European Split on Ukraine"
summary: "Russia is taking advantage of the fact that European leaders and U.S. officials have different views on Ukraine. Europe sees Putin as a threat that needs to be stopped, while some U.S. officials treat him like any other world leader. This disagreement makes it hard to agree on a peace plan. Meanwhile Russia keeps sending missiles and tries to push a deal that favors its own goals. The result is more conflict and less progress."
