title: "BrewDog’s sale plan may leave small investors empty‑handed"
summary: "BrewDog, a Scottish craft‑beer brewer, says it may be sold or split up. That could leave about 220,000 “equity‑punk” investors who put £75 million into the company over seven funding rounds with nothing. The sale would favour private‑equity firm TSG, which owns 22 % and could make a huge profit. BrewDog has lost money for five years, and its founder stepped down after a toxic‑workplace controversy."
