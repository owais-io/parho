title: "Why Yvette Cooper Won’t Criticise Trump Over Venezuela"
summary: "Yvette Cooper is careful not to call out Trump about Venezuela because the UK wants to keep the U.S. engaged in Ukraine’s security guarantees.  She says Venezuela needs a democratic change, but Britain fears that harsh criticism could push Trump away and jeopardise the fragile U.S.‑UK cooperation on Ukraine.  The article explains how U.S. officials like Rubio and Kushner are key to keeping that partnership alive while Britain tries to influence Latin‑American politics without provoking Trump."
