title: "2025: Heat, drought and fires took a toll on UK nature"
summary: "In 2025 the UK saw a year of extreme weather – scorching heat, drought, fierce fires and later floods – that put many plants, animals and landscapes under pressure. The National Trust reported huge losses: forests and young trees suffered, animal numbers fell, and several rare species were wiped out. Some adaptable creatures, like grey seals and certain butterflies, did fine. The report says urgent, coordinated action is needed to help the more vulnerable species survive."
