title: "Trump Removes Key Climate Rule That Lets EPA Regulate Greenhouse Gases"
summary: "Trump’s administration has cancelled the 2009 ‘endangerment finding’, the rule that told the EPA it could regulate greenhouse gases. Without it, the agency loses the legal power to set limits on car, truck and power‑plant emissions. Climate scientists and environmental groups say the move threatens public health, jobs, and the U.S. auto industry. The EPA says it will save money, but critics argue the real costs will be higher. States and NGOs plan to sue the rule."
