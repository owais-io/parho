title: "Labour's Local Council Reorganisation: Why It’s a Risky Move"
summary: "Labour’s new plan will merge many English districts into larger unitary authorities, cutting the number of local councillors by thousands. Supporters say it will save money and make councils easier to run, but there’s no evidence it actually works. Critics warn it could wipe out local identities, give one party an advantage, and distract from deeper problems such as social‑care crises and council tax reform."
