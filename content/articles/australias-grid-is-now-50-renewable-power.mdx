title: "Australia’s Grid Is Now 50% Renewable Power"
summary: "Australia’s electricity system has reached a milestone – more than half of the power supplied last quarter came from renewables and batteries. Prices fell 40% from a year earlier, and the grid handled a recent heatwave with only a few outages. Gas use is dropping, and new storage and transmission projects are boosting reliability. While coal will stay on the grid a few more years, the move to clean energy is speeding up and should lower household bills by 2026."
