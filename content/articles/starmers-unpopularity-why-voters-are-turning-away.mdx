title: "Starmer’s Unpopularity: Why Voters Are Turning Away"
summary: "Starmer’s new leader role has been hit by a series of missteps. His hard‑line stance on immigration, mistakes over Gaza and cuts to disability benefits have alienated many voters. He also talks in vague, generic terms, which makes him feel distant and untrustworthy. His appointment of questionable officials and failure to break from past politics add to the frustration. All of this has made Starmer a polarising figure and his poll numbers fall."
