title: "Colossal’s “de‑extinction” claims are being challenged by scientists"
summary: "Colossal Biosciences, led by Ben Lamm, says it has brought extinct animals back to life, like the dire wolf and a “woolly mouse” version of a mammoth. They use gene‑editing on grey wolves and Asian elephants. Big names such as Paris Hilton and Peter Jackson invest in the company. But scientists say the animals aren’t real extinct species – they’re just edited versions of living ones. The claim has sparked criticism and concerns about misleading the public."
