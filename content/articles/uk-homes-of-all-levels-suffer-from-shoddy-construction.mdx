title: "UK Homes of All Levels Suffer From Shoddy Construction"
summary: "Britain’s construction sector is in crisis. Even wealthy residents of luxury flats have to pay millions to fix faulty pipes. Thousands of ordinary families face damp, mould, and leaks caused by poor workmanship. A report found 98 % of external insulation installed in the last decade was done badly. The problems stem from cheap training, weak regulation, and contracts that let builders cut corners. Without stronger rules and skilled workers, the country will keep paying huge repair bills."
