title: "Rat poisons sold in stores threaten wildlife, scientists say"
summary: "Australia’s review says rat poisons sold in supermarkets can kill native wildlife like owls and quolls. The report will cancel some products and tighten rules on others but won’t ban them outright. Scientists and wildlife groups want a total ban on the more toxic second‑generation poisons, banned in parts of the US, Canada and the EU. The government will suspend these poisons while it asks the public for comments, and retailers say they will follow the final rules."

Australia’s review says rat poisons sold in supermarkets can kill native wildlife like owls and quolls. The report will cancel some products and tighten rules on others but won’t ban them outright. Scientists and wildlife groups want a total ban on the more toxic second‑generation poisons, banned in parts of the US, Canada and the EU.
