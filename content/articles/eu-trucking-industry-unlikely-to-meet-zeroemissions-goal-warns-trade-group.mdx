title: "EU Trucking Industry Unlikely to Meet Zero‑Emissions Goal, Warns Trade Group"
summary: "A European trucking trade group says the industry has a slim chance of meeting the EU’s zero‑emissions goal. Of the 6 million trucks on European roads, only about 10 000 are electric, and the sector lacks enough charging stations—just 1 500 exist but 35 000 are needed. Costs are high, with an electric 40‑tonne truck costing roughly €300 000. The group urges the Commission to review the targets early, or they could face huge fines."
