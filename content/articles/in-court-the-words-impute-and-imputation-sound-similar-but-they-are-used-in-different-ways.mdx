title: "In court, the words **impute** and **imputation** sound similar, but they are used in different ways."
summary: "**Impute**   *Verb* – to say that someone did something.   Example: “The judge **imputed** that Bruce Lehrmann had raped Brittany Higgins.”   It means the judge is attaching the act of rape to Lehrmann. **Imputation**   *Noun* – the act of saying someone did something.   Example: “The court’s **imputation** was that Lehrmann had committed rape.”   It is the name of the claim that the judge made. So, **impute** is the action (the judge’s statement).   **Imputation** is the result of that action (the claim that was made)."
