title: "Denmark unites as Trump threatens to invade Greenland"
summary: "Denmark has been in crisis after former U.S. President Donald Trump said he might invade Greenland, a Danish territory. Thousands marched in Copenhagen, waving flags and wearing protest hats that read “Nu det NUUK!” The anger has brought Danes and Greenlanders closer, with some calling for boycotts of U.S. products and the singer Björk. The incident also reminded people of past colonial abuses, like the IUD scandal. Many hope the shock turns into lasting change."
