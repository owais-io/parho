title: "Trump Bans Big Investors from Buying Single‑Family Homes"
summary: "Trump has issued an executive order stopping large institutional investors—like asset managers and pension funds—from buying single‑family houses in the U.S. He wants to stop “corporate” ownership that pushes rents up. The move surprises many, as it aligns with left‑wing critics of rent hikes. It could shift investors to the UK, where Labour’s Keir Starmer is still trying to win their support to fund new homes."
