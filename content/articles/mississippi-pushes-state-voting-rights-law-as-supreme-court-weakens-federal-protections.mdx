title: "Mississippi pushes state voting rights law as Supreme Court weakens federal protections"
summary: "Mississippi lawmakers are drafting a state‑level Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court weakened the federal law. The bill would create a voting rights commission that must approve any election changes, protect voters with limited English, and guard against minority voter dilution. Advocates say state laws are needed because federal protections could be lost. Other states like California and New York already have similar acts."
