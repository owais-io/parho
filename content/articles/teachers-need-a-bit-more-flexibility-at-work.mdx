summary: "School leaders are looking at ways to ease teachers’ heavy workloads, but many of the changes suggested are costly or drastic. The article argues that small, cost‑neutral tweaks—like allowing teachers to leave during planning time, attend child‑school events, or work part‑time after maternity leave—could make a big difference. Currently, teachers often lose pay or have requests denied, making teaching jobs less flexible than many other careers."
