title: "Scientists Recreate Ancient Smells, Even a T‑Rex’s Breath, in Museums"
summary: "Scientists have turned old chemical analyses into real smells that visitors can experience in museums. By studying residues in ancient Egyptian mummification balms, researchers recreated a honey‑spiced perfume called the “Scent of the Afterlife” and put it on cards and in stations. Similar work has let people sniff the breath of a T‑rex or the interior of Queen Elizabeth’s Rover car. These scents help explain history, trade, and everyday life in a new, tangible way."
