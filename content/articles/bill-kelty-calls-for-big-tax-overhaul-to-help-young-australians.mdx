title: "Bill Kelty calls for big tax overhaul to help young Australians"
summary: "Bill Kelty, a veteran union leader, said Labor needs a big tax overhaul. He supports cutting the 50% capital‑gains discount for investors but says it must be part of wider changes that ease the tax burden on young workers. Kelty wants income‑tax thresholds tied to inflation, a lower top rate, and a fairer system so young people aren’t forced into debt or extremism. It warns that if the government stays timid, more young Australians may turn to fringe politics."
