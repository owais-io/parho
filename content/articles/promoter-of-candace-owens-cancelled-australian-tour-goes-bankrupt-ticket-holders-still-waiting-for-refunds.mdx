title: "Promoter of Candace Owens' cancelled Australian tour goes bankrupt, ticket holders still waiting for refunds"
summary: "Rocksman, the promoter that was supposed to bring Candace Owens to Australia, has gone bankrupt, leaving more than a year of ticket holders still unpaid. The Australian government denied Owens a visa because she could stir up trouble, and a court upheld the decision. Rocksman owes roughly $68,000 to the tax office and has no other assets, so the liquidator says refunds are unlikely unless new money is found. Consumers are urged to contact the liquidator for updates."
