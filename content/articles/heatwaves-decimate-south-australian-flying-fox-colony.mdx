title: "Heatwaves Decimate South Australian Flying Fox Colony"
summary: "A colony of around 1,000 flying‑fox bats near Naracoorte in South Australia was hit by last week’s record heat. Over 80% of the bats died, leaving about 180 survivors, many babies that are now being rescued. This loss follows a previous heatwave that killed thousands of bats nationwide. Volunteers and wildlife groups used water trucks, misting and sprinklers to help the remaining bats, but the cost of feeding and caring for the survivors is a long‑term challenge."
