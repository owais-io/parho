title: "Will the New U.S. Peace Plan Help End the Ukraine War?"
summary: "Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss a U.S. 28‑point peace plan that favors Moscow. The talks ended with no progress; Russia still demands huge concessions from Ukraine, like cutting its army and refusing NATO membership. European leaders hoped the week could be pivotal, but fear the talks may force Ukraine to make tough compromises. Witkoff, a former property developer with little diplomatic experience, was unlikely to push hard for a deal."
