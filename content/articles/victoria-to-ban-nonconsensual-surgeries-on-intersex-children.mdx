title: "Victoria to ban non‑consensual surgeries on intersex children"
summary: "Victoria is set to become the first Australian state to stop non‑consensual surgeries on intersex children until they can say yes. Health Minister Mary‑Anne Thomas will introduce a bill that bans elective, irreversible procedures for babies and kids, except in life‑saving emergencies. An independent panel will review any other treatments, and parents must give consent if the child can’t. The move follows a report showing many unnecessary operations were done for cosmetic reasons."
