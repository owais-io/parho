title: "Old Shell Trumpets in Spain May Be Among the Earliest Musical Instruments"
summary: "Archaeologists in Catalonia found 12 large conch shells that date back 6,000 years. They were likely used to send long‑distance messages and as simple wind instruments. Experiments by a trumpet‑player turned researcher show the shells make a strong, steady tone—similar to a French horn—and can be played in small improvisations. The shells may have helped villages communicate and work together in mines, while also offering early music for expression."
