title: "Labour minister sends false Russian links about journalists to UK spy agency"
summary: "Labour minister Josh Simons sent emails to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) claiming that journalists were part of a pro‑Russian network. He did this after hiring a U.S. firm to dig into a Sunday Times story that exposed undeclared donations to his think‑tank, Labour Together. The claims were untrue and included private details. The NCSC declined to investigate, and Simons is now under a cabinet‑office ethics probe and facing calls to quit."
