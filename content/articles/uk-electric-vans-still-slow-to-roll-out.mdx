title: "UK electric vans still slow to roll out"
summary: "Electric vans are being added to UK fleets like Royal Mail and Openreach, but sales still lag behind government targets. The government wants 16% of new vans to be electric in 2025, yet only 9.5% are sold. High upfront costs, charging hassles and manufacturers using credit flexibilities keep buyers cautious. While big fleets see cost savings and fewer breakdowns, smaller firms worry about range and price, slowing overall adoption."
