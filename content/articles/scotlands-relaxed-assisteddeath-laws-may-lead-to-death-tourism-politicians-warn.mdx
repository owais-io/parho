title: "Scotland’s relaxed assisted‑death laws may lead to ‘death tourism’, politicians warn"
summary: "Scottish MPs are worried that the new assisted‑death bill, which lets people apply without a time limit, could turn Scotland into a popular spot for people from England and Wales who want a quicker way to end their lives. The bill may be in force before the UK version, which could take up to four years to pass. While some MPs fear that “death tourism” could rise, others argue that moving while ill is too difficult for most, and the debate is set for a February vote."
