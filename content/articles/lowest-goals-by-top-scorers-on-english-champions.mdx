title: "Lowest Goals by Top Scorers on English Champions"
summary: "The piece looks at how many goals the top scorer on a title‑winning English club has scored. Arsenal’s 2024 champions had only five goals from their leading scorers, an unusually low total for a league‑winner. It lists seasons from the 1930s to today when champions’ top scorers hit fewer than 15 goals, showing many teams share the load instead of relying on one star. Earlier eras had higher top scorers, but shared scoring has become common."
