title: "Dublin Bay Reintroduces Oysters to Restore Its Lost Ecosystem"
summary: "A volunteer group in Dún Laoghaire has placed 18,000 adult oysters in 300 baskets to start rebuilding Dublin Bay’s long‑gone oyster reefs. The oysters aren’t for eating; they’ll breed and clean the water, boosting fish, seaweed and overall biodiversity. The Green Ocean Foundation, inspired by New York’s Billion Oyster Project, is watching the baskets grow, hoping they’ll become a thriving reef and bring more life to the harbor."
