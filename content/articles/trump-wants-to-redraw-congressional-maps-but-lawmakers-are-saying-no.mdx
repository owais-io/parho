title: "Trump Wants to Redraw Congressional Maps, but Lawmakers Are Saying No"
summary: "Trump is trying to redraw congressional districts before the 2026 elections so that Republicans keep a majority in the House. He first pushed Texas to add five new Republican‑friendly districts, but a federal court blocked the move, and the Supreme Court may review it. Governors, state legislators, and even some Republicans in Kansas, Indiana, and Maryland are resisting these changes, saying the process is unfair and could backfire. State lawmakers argue that redrawing districts mid‑decade can confuse voters and weaken trust in elections."
