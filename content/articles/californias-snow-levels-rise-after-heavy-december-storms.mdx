title: "California’s Snow Levels Rise After Heavy December Storms"
summary: "A bunch of December storms helped lift California’s snowpack, scientists said. At a Sierra Nevada station, snow was 24 inches deep and overall the state’s snow is at 71% of what’s typical for this time of year. The extra snow is good for water supplies, but officials warn it’s still early and more storms are needed. Reservoirs are already fuller than usual, giving hope for farms and cities later this summer."
