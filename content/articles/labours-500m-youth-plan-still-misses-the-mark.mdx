title: "Labour’s £500m youth plan still misses the mark"
summary: "The Guardian column argues that Labour’s new £500m youth strategy, announced by Keir Starmer, is too thin and relies on celebrity‑style outreach like Starmer’s TikTok. The plan focuses on funding youth workers, apprenticeships and mental‑health reviews, but misses key Gen‑Z wants: trusted adults, real‑world activities, jobs, and better mental‑health support. It also ignores the “broken social contract” that leaves young people feeling ignored. A deeper rethink of how society supports teens is needed."
