title: "Australia’s gas bills are rising – will the new Labor plan bring relief?"
summary: "Australia’s gas bills have jumped 130% in 15 years, and households in cities like Melbourne and Sydney are paying the most. The government will soon unveil a plan to make gas cheaper, but experts say the rise is due to fading cheap gas, export of LNG, and a lack of competition. Supply is expected to shrink while demand stays high, so moving to electricity may help reduce costs."
