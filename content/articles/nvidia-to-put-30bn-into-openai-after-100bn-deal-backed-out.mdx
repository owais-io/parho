title: "Nvidia to Put $30bn into OpenAI After $100bn Deal Backed Out"
summary: "Nvidia says it will invest $30bn in OpenAI’s upcoming round, even though the earlier $100bn deal fell apart. The new deal gives Nvidia a stake in OpenAI without forcing the AI lab to use its chips. OpenAI is also looking to other chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom. The funding could value OpenAI at $730bn, making it one of the world’s most valuable private firms."
