title: "Europe Could Cut Ties With US Bonds"
summary: "European countries are looking at ways to reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds, especially after Denmark’s pension fund decided to sell all its US debt. The move would signal a financial “divorce” from the United States and could push Europe to create its own euro‑denominated bond market. By doing so, Europe could lower its borrowing costs and protect itself from possible US political and financial pressure, especially under a Trump‑style administration."
