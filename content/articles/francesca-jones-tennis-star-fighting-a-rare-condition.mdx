title: "Francesca Jones: Tennis Star Fighting a Rare Condition"
summary: "Francesca Jones, a 25‑year‑old tennis player, has a rare birth defect called Ectrodactyly‑Ectodermal Dysplasia, which gives her hands and feet unusual shapes. It makes holding the racket hard and often forces her to retire from matches because of pain or injury. Despite this, she’s won big tournaments, climbed from outside the top 150 to No. 72, and recently beat a top‑15 player. She keeps training harder to stay healthy and stay in the top 70."
