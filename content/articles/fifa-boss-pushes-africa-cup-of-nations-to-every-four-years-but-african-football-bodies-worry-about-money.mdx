title: "FIFA boss pushes Africa Cup of Nations to every four years, but African football bodies worry about money"
summary: "FIFA president Gianni Infantino wants the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to be played every four years instead of every two, starting in 2028. CAF’s leaders, especially South Africa’s Patrice Motsepe, agree in principle but worry that the change will cut their income—AFCON has made up about 80% of CAF’s revenue. They plan to launch new tournaments and raise member support money to fill the gap. Some critics say CAF is being run by a toxic, top‑down culture."
