title: "Gambia Supreme Court to decide on ending ban on female genital cutting"
summary: "In the Gambia, a group of religious leaders and a member of parliament want the Supreme Court to undo the country’s ban on female genital mutilation (FGM). The move follows two babies who died after FGM last year and a failed bill that would have made FGM legal. Women’s rights groups say this threatens the country’s progress, noting that almost 75 % of Gambian women have been cut. The court will consider arguments that the law violates cultural and religious freedom."
