title: "Georgia Wants to Stop New Data Centers for a Year"
summary: "Georgia lawmakers are pushing a bill that would pause all new data‑center projects until next March. The move comes as the state’s biggest power plan, mostly from fossil fuels, is set to supply 10 gigawatts of energy to support AI‑powered data centers. The bill gives local governments time to decide how to regulate these energy‑hungry facilities and aims to protect residents from higher electric bills, water use, and lost tax revenue."
