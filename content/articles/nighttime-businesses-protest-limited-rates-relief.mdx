title: "Night‑time businesses protest limited rates relief"
summary: "The government announced that pubs and live‑music venues will get a 15% cut in business rates from 1 April, but no help for other night‑time or hospitality sectors. Nightclubs, restaurants, gyms, pharmacies and local shops say the new relief is too small and unfair. They argue the rising rates hurt their costs, jobs and prices, and demand wider support across the industry."
