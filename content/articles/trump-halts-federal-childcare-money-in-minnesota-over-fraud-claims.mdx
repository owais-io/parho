title: "Trump Halts Federal Childcare Money in Minnesota Over Fraud Claims"
summary: "Trump officials said they will stop federal funding for Minnesota childcare programs because they believe fraud is happening. The move came after a conservative influencer posted a video accusing Somali‑owned day‑cares of stealing money. Earlier investigations had already convicted dozens of people in a $250m child‑nutrition scam. The freeze requires extra proof before money is sent and sets up a fraud hotline. Minnesota’s governor says the action is political and the state will audit day‑cares."
