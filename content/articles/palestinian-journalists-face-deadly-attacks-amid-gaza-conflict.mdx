title: "Palestinian journalists face deadly attacks amid Gaza conflict"
summary: "In 2025, 67 Palestinian reporters were killed while covering the war in Gaza, including young Anas al‑Sharif who was shot in a media tent in August. Israeli forces have falsely accused many local journalists of being Hamas fighters, but no proof exists. A strict Gaza press ban blocks international reporters, making it harder to share stories and protect local staff. UN groups and press‑freedom advocates say these killings are war crimes that must stop."
