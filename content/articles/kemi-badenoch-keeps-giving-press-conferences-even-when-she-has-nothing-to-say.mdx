title: "Kemi Badenoch Keeps Giving Press Conferences Even When She Has Nothing to Say"
summary: "The article jokes about how Kemi Badenoch, a Conservative MP, keeps holding press conferences that feel more like self‑attention‑seeking than real news. Few journalists attend, and her speeches repeat the same points on topics such as grooming gangs and welfare reform. The piece criticises the trend of politicians using press conferences for buzz rather than substance, and notes her lack of fresh content."
