summary: "Misconduct in public office means a public official deliberately abuses or neglects duties for personal gain or harm. It is an indictable crime that goes straight to crown courts and can carry up to life in prison. Investigators say the law is vague and overlaps other crimes, making it hard to prove and often taking years. The Law Commission is reviewing it and may split it into two separate offences."
