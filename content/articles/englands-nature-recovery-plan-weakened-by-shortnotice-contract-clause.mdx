title: "England’s nature recovery plan weakened by short‑notice contract clause"
summary: "The UK government’s new nature recovery plan has been weakened by a clause that lets it cancel contracts after just one year. Conservation groups say this, combined with only £500 m set aside over 20 years, will make farmers hesitant to make permanent habitat changes. The plan aimed to protect huge areas of land for wildlife, but targets have been cut and private money is unlikely to fill the gap. Farmers fear losing their work and the plan may fail."
