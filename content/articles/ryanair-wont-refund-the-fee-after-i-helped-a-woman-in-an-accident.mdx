After stopping to treat her, he arrived at the gate only 15 minutes before it closed and missed his flight. Ryanair forced him to re‑book a more expensive flight and refused to waive the £100 transfer fee. The passenger also lost a car hire and had to pay for a hotel, but the airline said it was the passenger’s responsibility."
