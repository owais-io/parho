title: "Life in 2035: How AI Will Change Your Everyday World"
summary: "In 2035, AI doctors will handle most routine check‑ups, giving quick pre‑diagnoses and suggesting treatments that human doctors can review. Lawyers use AI to research cases and even argue in court, but fairness worries have risen. Wearable AI glasses and watches help you remember things, tell you what’s missing from the fridge, and even plan your day. Farms use AI to spot sick animals and plan planting. Work will be faster and lighter, leaving more free time, but people may feel bored or need new hobbies."
