title: "Wales Landowners Reduce Hedge Cutting, Rare Butterfly Thrives"
summary: "After years of mechanical flailing, Welsh landowners have stopped cutting hedges each autumn. This change lets the rare brown hairstreak butterfly lay eggs on blackthorn without being destroyed. Volunteer counts show record numbers of eggs and a 50 % jump from last year. The new sustainable farming scheme now requires less cutting, and conservation groups are planting more blackthorn. The butterfly’s comeback shows that gentler hedge management benefits many species."
