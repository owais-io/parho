title: "Europe’s lost credibility in the Middle East – How it could rebuild its role in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon"
summary: "Europe’s influence in the Middle East has shrunk because of its weak stance on Gaza, its focus on the Ukraine war, and its sidelining by the U.S. and regional powers. The article argues that Europe can still matter by helping Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, which are fragile and need support. Re‑engaging in these countries would let Europe regain credibility and offer real help where it’s most needed."
