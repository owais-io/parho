title: "Dundee Nurse Wins Tribunal Over Trans Doctor's Changing Room Use"
summary: "Sandie Peggie, a Dundee nurse, won a tribunal case after she said she had to share a changing room with a transgender doctor. The court said the Supreme Court ruling doesn’t automatically ban trans people from using facilities that match their gender. Other tribunals are deciding similar cases. The rulings don’t yet set legal precedent but show employers still need to balance fairness. Reactions are mixed – some say the decisions ignore the law, others see hope for inclusive workplaces."
