title: "Greens plan new law to give councils control over expanding berry farms"
summary: "The NSW Greens plan a new law next week to give local councils more power to control the fast‑growing blueberry and berry farms that are pushing into rural areas. The bill would require buffers from homes and waterways, tighter rules on spraying and runoff, and better monitoring of pesticides. It also tackles worker abuse claims on seasonal farm jobs and follows a recent court case where a council lost a fight over polytunnel approvals."
