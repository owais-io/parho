title: "UK NHS will fund drug price deal from its own budget"
summary: "The UK government said it will pay a drug‑pricing deal with the United States from the NHS budget, not from the Treasury. The first three years will cost about £1 billion, and the price could climb to as much as £9 billion a year by 2035. MPs from Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and SNP fear the extra cost may force NHS cuts, and critics say the government still hides the long‑term bill."
