title: "Doge Agency Quietly Shut Down Early"
summary: "The so‑called Doge agency—Department of Government Efficiency—appears to have shut down early, eight months before its contract ends, says OPM director Scott Kupor. Created by a Trump executive order on his first day, Doge cut federal jobs, slashed spending, and lacked clear records. Over 200,000 workers were fired or bought out. Now the OPM has taken over most duties, and former Doge leaders are moving to other government roles."
