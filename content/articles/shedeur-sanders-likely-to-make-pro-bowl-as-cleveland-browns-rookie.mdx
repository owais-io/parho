title: "Shedeur Sanders Likely to Make Pro Bowl as Cleveland Browns Rookie"
summary: "Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is set to become the first in his family to earn a Pro Bowl spot, beating out veteran options like Patrick Mahomes. Despite a 3‑4 record and a 56.6% completion rate in games he started, fan support helped him win the nod. His selection will be a talking point, especially as his legendary father, Deion Sanders, is a Hall‑of‑Fame legend. The Pro Bowl will feature other AFC quarterbacks like Josh Allen and Justin Herbert."
