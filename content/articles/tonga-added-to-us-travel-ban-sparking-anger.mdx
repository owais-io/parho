title: "Tonga Added to US Travel Ban, Sparking Anger"
summary: "Tonga faces new US travel limits, sparking anger. On Jan 1, the Trump‑era U.S. added Tonga to a list of countries from which visas are heavily restricted. Officials cite a high overstay rate, but critics say the ban unfairly targets a small Pacific nation and hurts students, workers and family ties, especially in Hawaii and New Zealand. Tonga’s leaders and U.S. politicians have called the move unjust."
