title: "Israel plans new road and wall that will cut through West Bank farmland"
summary: "Farmers in the West Bank’s Jordan valley are being told to leave their fields and homes because Israel is building a new road and wall. The project, called “Crimson Thread”, will cut through some of the region’s best farmland and split communities. Israeli officials say it is for security, but human‑rights activists argue it is about taking land for settlers. Families have been given eviction notices and only seven days to leave. This could also limit farmers’ water access."
