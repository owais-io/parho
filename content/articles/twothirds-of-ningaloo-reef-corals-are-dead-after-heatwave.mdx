title: "Two‑Thirds of Ningaloo Reef Corals Are Dead After Heatwave"
summary: "Scientists say that almost two‑thirds of the corals at Ningaloo Reef, a popular tourist spot in Western Australia, died after a record heatwave turned the reefs white. In a survey of 1,600 corals, only about 600 survived. The loss removed key fish homes and made the area quiet and lifeless. This event is part of the world’s worst bleaching crisis, threatening reefs everywhere."
