title: "Victoria Fire Service Funding: What the New Report Reveals"
summary: "Victoria’s state government and the Country Fire Authority (CFA) are in a dispute over fire‑service funding. A new report says the CFA received $361 m last year – the highest in five years – up from $339 m the year before. However, the agency still ran a $50 m deficit, has an aging fleet, and saw a small drop in volunteers. The opposition calls the rise misleading, while the government says it’s better funded."
