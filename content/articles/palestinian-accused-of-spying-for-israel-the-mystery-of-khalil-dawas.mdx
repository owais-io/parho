title: "Palestinian accused of spying for Israel: the mystery of Khalil Dawas"
summary: "Khalil Dawas was a young man from Jericho who many say worked for Israeli intelligence. After jail, his neighbors grew suspicious. In October, Hamas handed Israel four bodies it claimed were Israeli soldiers; forensic tests confirmed three, but the fourth turned out to be a Palestinian. Gaza officials say the body is Dawas, but community refuses to accept or bury him, fearing reprisals. The case shows how fragile the line is between collusion and community loyalty."
