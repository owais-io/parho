title: "What Makes Up the UK’s Power Grid"
summary: "The UK’s power grid is made up of several parts that work together. Electricity starts at power stations—gas, nuclear, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal—and then travels through high‑voltage transmission lines on tall pylons. Substations change the voltage for safer delivery, and smaller transformers step it down again for homes and businesses. Lower‑voltage distribution lines bring the power to every socket, while cables under the sea link the UK to other countries."
