title: "Labour pledges £45bn to build new northern rail network"
summary: "The UK government has agreed to spend up to £45 billion on a new rail network called Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). The plan will connect cities from Liverpool to Newcastle in three stages, with upgrades to existing lines, a new Liverpool‑Manchester route, and links across the Pennines. Mayors may need to raise extra money, but the scheme should give faster trains and boost jobs in the north. Labour says this will finally deliver on promises for the region."
