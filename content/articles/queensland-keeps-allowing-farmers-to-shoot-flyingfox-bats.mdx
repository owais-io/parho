title: "Queensland keeps allowing farmers to shoot flying‑fox bats"
summary: "Queensland has undone its plan to stop the shooting of flying‑fox bats that farmers use to protect fruit crops. The state still lets farmers kill up to 1,630 bats a year, including vulnerable species, if other methods have failed. Wildlife groups say the practice is cruel and not effective, and they urge the use of netting instead. In the past decade, about 20,000 bats have been shot under the program."
