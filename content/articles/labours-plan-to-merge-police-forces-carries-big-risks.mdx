title: "Labour’s plan to merge police forces carries big risks"
summary: "Labour’s new white paper would cut 43 police forces into fewer, larger ones and create a single National Police Service to handle counter‑terrorism, serious crime and fraud. Training, standards and leadership would all be run under one umbrella, and police‑commissioner roles would be replaced by local boards. Critics warn that centralising power could erode local accountability, raise costs, and threaten operational independence."
