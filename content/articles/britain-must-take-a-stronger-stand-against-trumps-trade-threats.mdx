title: "Britain Must Take a Stronger Stand Against Trump’s Trade Threats"
summary: "Donald Trump’s aggressive trade moves risk the UK‑US relationship. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey says the UK’s current appeasement strategy has failed. He urges Britain to partner with the EU and use a “trade bazooka” – strong tariffs and targeted actions – to push Trump back. This could involve canceling costly US deals, adding Tesla tariffs, and limiting defence contracts to protect jobs and keep the NHS affordable."
