title: "Queensland Police to Shut Down Domestic‑Violence Support Unit"
summary: "Queensland Police are ending a statewide support unit that helped officers handle domestic and family‑violence cases. Frontline staff say the unit was essential for sharing information and keeping victims safe, especially in regional areas. The decision follows a 100‑day review that said domestic‑violence work isn’t core police business. Officers will be moved to local precincts, and the police say the change will make the force more responsive."
