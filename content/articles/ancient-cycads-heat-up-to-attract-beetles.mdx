title: "Ancient Cycads Heat Up to Attract Beetles"
summary: "275‑million‑year‑old cycads are the planet’s oldest seed plants that rely on insects for pollination. When it’s time to reproduce, their cones crank up their metabolism and rise more than 10 °C above the surroundings, sending a warm signal that beetles can detect with infrared sensors. Each cycad species has a matching beetle that finds the hot cones at night, first visiting males for pollen and then females for fertilisation."
