title: "Can Peter Mandelson Lose His Lord Title Over Epstein Ties?"
summary: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants former minister Peter Mandelson expelled from the House of Lords because he had links to Jeffrey Epstein. Removing a peer is tough— the law only lets a peer resign, and the title stays. If Mandelson quits the Lords it would simply mean he can’t sit in the chamber, but he can still call himself “Lord”. True removal would need a new Act of Parliament, which is unlikely."
