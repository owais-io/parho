title: "1 in 9 New Homes in England Are Built in Flood‑Risk Areas"
summary: "A new study shows that 1 in 9 of the 396,602 new homes built in England between 2022‑24 were built in areas that could now be at risk of flooding. The percentage of at‑risk homes is climbing, and by 2050 the danger could hit almost a third of new builds. The data warns that the government's push to deliver 1.5 million homes could put people in unsafe places and that many of these homes are not covered by the national flood‑insurance scheme."
