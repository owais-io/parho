title: "11 UK towns have seen disposable income double the national average"
summary: "Eleven towns and cities in England have seen their disposable incomes grow twice as fast as the UK average over the past decade. The Centre for Cities study found an average rise of 5.2% in these places versus 2.4% nationally. Success comes from building high‑skilled jobs, trade‑able businesses and strong local economies. The report urges governments to focus on growth, not just short‑term cost‑of‑living fixes."
