title: "U.S. Funding Cuts Threaten New mRNA Cancer Therapies"
summary: "The writer says a new mRNA vaccine helped them beat aggressive melanoma and gave them a year of life. But U.S. researchers just cut $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA projects. This means companies like Moderna and Merck will slow their work, leaving patients in the UK and U.S. with fewer treatment options. With thousands of new melanoma cases each year, the cuts could cost many lives."
