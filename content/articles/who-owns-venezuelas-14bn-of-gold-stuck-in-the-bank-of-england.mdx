title: "Who Owns Venezuela’s £1.4bn of Gold Stuck in the Bank of England?"
summary: "The Bank of England holds about 31 tonnes of Venezuelan gold worth roughly £1.4bn. Since the 1980s, Venezuela’s gold has been frozen in London because the US and UK refused to let Maduro’s government reclaim it. The legal fight is still on: Venezuela, the former opposition leader Guaidó, and the UK all claim rights to the bars. The dispute reflects wider tensions over frozen assets and shows why gold has risen in price."
