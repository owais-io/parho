title: "Two Oak Trees by the Old Oswestry Hillfort"
summary: "I walked past two old oak trees beside the lane below Old Oswestry hillfort. One is a massive Quercus robur that looks out over the Shropshire plain, while the other is a coppiced oak with six small trunks, showing how people once cut oaks to grow new ones. The author reflects on the tree’s history, the nearby ancient hillfort, and the tiny ecosystems—lichens, fungi, microbes—that live on the bark. These oaks tell stories of the land."
