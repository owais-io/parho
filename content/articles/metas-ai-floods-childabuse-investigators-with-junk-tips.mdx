summary: "Child‑abuse investigators say Meta’s AI is sending thousands of junk reports that waste police time. U.S. law‑enforcement groups claim the tips are often empty or missing evidence, so they can’t help solve real cases. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children and Meta say the system works, but the flood of useless alerts is draining resources and lowering morale."
