title: "Social media hurts Australian teens’ body image – platforms must act"
summary: "Eating disorders among 10‑to‑19‑year‑olds have jumped 86% since 2012, a rise that lines up with more social‑media use and COVID‑19. Teen‑aged patients get targeted diet and disordered content, which can worsen their health. The government banned social‑media accounts for those under 16, but experts say that alone isn’t enough. They want tech companies to adopt a duty of care, let users pause feeds, and face penalties if they fail to protect young people. Helplines are available for support."
