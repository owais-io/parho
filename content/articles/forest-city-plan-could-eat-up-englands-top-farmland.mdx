title: "Forest city plan could eat up England’s top farmland"
summary: "A new plan to create a “forest city” in east Cambridgeshire would cover 18,000 hectares, plus a 4,800‑hectare forest, turning some of England’s best farmland into trees. That would damage the country’s already‑strained food supply. Farmers’ fields are productive and support wildlife, so replacing them with forest would add noise, light and air pollution that could hurt nature instead of helping. The proposal shows the need to balance green projects with food security."
