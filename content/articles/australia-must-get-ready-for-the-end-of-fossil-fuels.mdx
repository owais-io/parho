title: "Australia Must Get Ready for the End of Fossil Fuels"
summary: "Two years after climate officials said fossil fuels would end, Australia still relies heavily on coal and LNG exports. While renewables now power half of its electricity, the grid needs more security as old coal plants close. The government keeps approving new export projects, but experts say coal and gas demand will drop 40‑60% in the next decade. Australia needs to plan for jobs, investment, and a net‑zero future, or it risks economic loss and climate harm."
