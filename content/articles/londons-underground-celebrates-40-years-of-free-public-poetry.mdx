title: "London’s Underground Celebrates 40 Years of Free Public Poetry"
summary: "Poems on the Underground, a project that puts poems on London’s tube stations, turns 40 this month. It started in 1984 when writer Judith Chernaik wanted to put Shakespeare‑inspired verses on subway walls. The idea grew, and now cities worldwide have similar programs. New poems are picked three times a year, and a Cambridge archive keeps the collection safe. The free, daily doses of poetry help commuters feel calmer and more connected."
