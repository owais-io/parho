title: "Belgium to Shut Down 75 Unnecessary Streetlights in a National Park"
summary: "Belgium plans to turn off 75 unused streetlights in a national park to reduce light pollution and help wildlife. The project, part of a €308,000 budget, will cut lights that are far from homes and close to nature reserves. While residents worry about safety, studies show lighting rarely lowers crime or accidents. The move is aimed at restoring dark skies for insects, birds, and amphibians, and fits a wider European trend of limiting nighttime light."
