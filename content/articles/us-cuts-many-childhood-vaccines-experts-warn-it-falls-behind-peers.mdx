title: "US cuts many childhood vaccines, experts warn it falls behind peers"
summary: "In a surprise move, U.S. health officials stopped recommending about a third of routine childhood shots, leaving the country with the shortest vaccine schedule worldwide. The change, driven by vaccine skeptics, came without scientific review or public debate. It now limits many vaccines—like hepatitis A, RSV and meningitis—to high‑risk kids only, and reduces the HPV shot to one dose. Experts warn the move could raise disease outbreaks and puts the U.S. behind other wealthy nations that still offer full coverage."
