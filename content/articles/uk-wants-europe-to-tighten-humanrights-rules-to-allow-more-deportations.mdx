title: "UK wants Europe to tighten human‑rights rules to allow more deportations"
summary: "UK and 26 other European countries have signed an informal statement saying Europe’s human‑rights rules should be narrowed so that countries can deport criminals and work with other nations, like Rwanda, to send asylum seekers elsewhere. The move focuses on tightening Article 3, which protects people from inhuman treatment, and adjusting Article 8 for offenders. France, Spain and Germany chose a separate, official declaration that keeps the rules unchanged. The split shows a growing divide over migration and human‑rights protection."
