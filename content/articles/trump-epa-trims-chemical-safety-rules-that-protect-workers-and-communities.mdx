title: "Trump EPA Trims Chemical Safety Rules That Protect Workers and Communities"
summary: "The Trump EPA is rolling back rules that made chemical plants safer. The 2024 rules added tech to detect leaks, fire‑safety gear, and plans for workers to stop work or warn first responders. The new plan cuts most of those requirements and hides a public map of plant chemicals. Critics say this will hurt workers and communities near plants, raising risk of future explosions and toxic releases."
