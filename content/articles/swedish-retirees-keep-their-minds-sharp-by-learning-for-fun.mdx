title: "Swedish retirees keep their minds sharp by learning for fun"
summary: "Over 2,000 events in Sweden this year bring more than 177,000 older adults to study classes and lectures. A national “Senior University” lets retirees meet, learn about topics from languages to politics, and feel useful after work. Volunteers run the meetings, which help fight loneliness and keep people mentally active. Funding has slipped, but the movement shows how learning and social contact can improve health and families too."
