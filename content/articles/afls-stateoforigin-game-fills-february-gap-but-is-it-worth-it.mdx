title: "AFL’s State‑of‑Origin Game Fills February Gap – But Is It Worth It?"
summary: "The AFL has put a state‑of‑origin match back into February to give fans something to watch during a slow sports period. It’s heavily promoted and comes with a big marketing push, but critics say it feels more like an exhibition than a real competition. The timing is awkward, the commercial motives are clear, and the match may just be a nostalgic throwback that doesn’t add real meaning to the season."
