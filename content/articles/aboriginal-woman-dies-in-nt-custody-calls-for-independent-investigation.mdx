title: "Aboriginal woman dies in NT custody, calls for independent investigation"
summary: "A 44‑year‑old Aboriginal mother of five died in a Tennant Creek watch house after being arrested on Christmas Day. Police say she likely had a medical event, but her family and Aboriginal groups doubt an internal police probe is enough. They want a separate, transparent investigation to restore trust and prevent future deaths. The case highlights gaps in on‑site medical care for detainees and adds to the highest number of Indigenous deaths in custody in a year."
