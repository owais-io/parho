title: "Queensland’s new hate‑speech bill draws free‑speech criticism"
summary: "A Queensland law that would let the state attorney‑general ban words seen as “inciting hostility” has sparked worry across politics. The right‑wing Institute of Public Affairs says the bill is vague and gives too much power to one minister, risking censorship and jail time for people saying controversial phrases. Lawmakers rushed the bill through a week of public comment, but critics fear it could criminalise normal speech."
