title: "Labour should support a ban on social media for kids under 16"
summary: "Lisa Nandy says banning social media for under‑16s would criminalise kids, but that’s a distraction. The real problem is tech firms that keep children hooked. Most Brits want the age to rise from 13 to 16, and parents want real protection, not just guidance. Australia has already set the limit, showing it can work. Labour should support a 16‑year‑old minimum age to stop harmful content and keep children safe."
