title: "UK government protests X’s plan to charge for its AI image tool"
summary: "X, the platform owned by Elon Musk, decided to make its AI image‑making tool, Grok, available only to paid subscribers. The change angered users because the tool was often used to create illegal sexual images. The UK government called the move “insulting” and said it turns illegal content into a premium service. Several women‑rights groups are leaving X, and officials say they may support Ofcom or even quit the site."
