title: "Labor Group Wants to Cancel Israeli President's Visit to Australia"
summary: "A group of grassroots Labor members wants Prime Minister Albanese to cancel the invitation to Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who was invited for an early 2026 trip. They say Herzog’s support for Israel’s Gaza bombing is wrong and could spark protests and antisemitism. Some Jewish community groups also want the visit stopped, while others welcome it as a sign of solidarity. The government has no legal reason to block Herzog, who has head‑of‑state immunity."
