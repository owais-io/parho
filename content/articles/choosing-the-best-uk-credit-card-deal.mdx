title: "Choosing the Best UK Credit Card Deal"
summary: "Credit card terms matter. APR tells you the yearly borrowing cost—average UK APR is 35.7%. A 0% balance‑transfer card lets you move debt for up to 19 months with a 2.5% fee. Check eligibility first, pick the lowest fee and longest 0% period, and clear the balance before the deal ends. Many cards also offer 0% purchase periods and reward points or cash back, but high fees and interest can negate the perks if you can’t pay on time."
