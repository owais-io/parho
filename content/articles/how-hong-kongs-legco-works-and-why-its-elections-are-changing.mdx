title: "How Hong Kong’s LegCo Works and Why Its Elections Are Changing"
summary: "LegCo is Hong Kong’s small parliament that can make and change laws. Since 1997 China has tightened control, making opposition weak. Elections now let only a few seats be chosen by voters; most are filled by pro‑China groups. A 2020 national security law made protests illegal, and in 2021 China said only “patriotic” candidates can run. Voter turnout is very low, and some residents refuse to vote to show dissent."
