title: "UK Government Lost £11bn to Fraud During Covid"
summary: "A report by the Covid counter‑fraud commissioner says that fast‑tracked government help for businesses and workers during the pandemic let fraudsters steal almost £11 billion. Poor planning, weak data, bad contracts and lack of accountability let schemes like bounceback loans, furlough and “eat‑out‑to‑help‑out” be exploited. The government says it is improving fraud controls and has started to recover some money, but most of the losses are now unrecoverable. The report calls for stronger safeguards in future crises."
