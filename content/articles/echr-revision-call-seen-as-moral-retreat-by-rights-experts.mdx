title: "ECHR Revision Call Seen as Moral Retreat by Rights Experts"
summary: "Twenty-seven European countries want to change the European Convention on Human Rights, saying it blocks their ability to manage migration. Amnesty and other rights groups call this a moral retreat and warn it could create a hierarchy that favors some people over others. Experts say the convention was built after WWII to protect everyone, not limit migrants, and fear that reshaping it would weaken the rule of law and aid populist politics."
