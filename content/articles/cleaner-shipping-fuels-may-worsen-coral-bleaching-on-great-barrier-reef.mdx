title: "Cleaner Shipping Fuels May Worsen Coral Bleaching on Great Barrier Reef"
summary: "Cleaner shipping fuels may have made coral bleaching worse on the Great Barrier Reef. A new study shows that when ships stopped emitting sulphur – a move meant to cut air pollution – the sky over the reef let more sunshine in. Researchers analysed data from about 5,000 ships in February 2022 and found the reef received 5‑10% more heat, adding stress to corals. The effect is local, but it could hurt reef health."
