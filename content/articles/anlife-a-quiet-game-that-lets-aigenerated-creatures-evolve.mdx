title: "Anlife – A Quiet Game That Lets AI‑Generated Creatures Evolve"
summary: "Anlife is a new Steam title that lets players watch tiny AI‑driven creatures evolve in a quiet, colorful world. You drop food, add new shapes, and the AI learns to crawl, swim or float in surprising ways. The game echoes a 2016 Miyazaki clip that mocked AI‑animation, and its creators now hope Anlife shows how AI can make life‑like behaviours without human scripting. Fans can try it for £11.79 or $13.99."
