title: "Electric cars will replace diesel cars on UK roads by 2030"
summary: "A new study says electric cars will outnumber diesel cars on UK roads by 2030. Diesel sales have fallen to about 10 million vehicles, while electric cars make up only 4 % of the fleet. London will be the first city with no registered diesel cars, thanks to low‑emission zones. The shift will reduce harmful emissions and cut diesel imports, making cities cleaner and cheaper to drive. The change also means fewer diesel trucks on the road, though van sales have stayed high. People are moving older diesel cars from cities to the countryside, but as older models are scrapped, the number of diesel vehicles will continue to drop. This shift will help clean up air pollution and lower fuel costs for drivers."
