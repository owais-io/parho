summary: "Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, has urged UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to step aside before the upcoming Holyrood election. He says the move will help Labour win back voters who are unhappy with the party’s performance. Polls show Labour trailing the SNP and Reform UK, with only 15% support. Some voters welcome the gesture, while others call it back‑stabbing. The move could sharpen the focus on who should run Scotland."
