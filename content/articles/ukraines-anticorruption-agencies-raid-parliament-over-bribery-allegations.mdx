summary: "Ukraine’s top anti‑corruption agencies, Nabu and Sapo, searched the parliament in Kyiv to investigate MPs who may have taken bribes. The raid was part of a larger probe that already forced the president’s chief of staff to quit after a $100 million kick‑back scandal. While Ukrainian officials were on a trip to the U.S. and Canada to secure aid, Russia claimed to have taken more eastern towns, but Ukrainian troops are still holding key positions."
