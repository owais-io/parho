title: "Australia’s Bushfires May Be Worst Since 2019‑20 Black Summer"
summary: "Australia’s fire season is at danger, with over 50 blazes in New South Wales burning homes and causing a firefighter’s death. Temperatures hit 41 °C, winds spread the fire fast, and 3,500 hectares were scorched, taking four houses. Tasmania also saw a 700‑hectare blaze that destroyed 19 homes. Dry fuel built up after wet La Niña summers and recent drought fuels it, possibly the worst since the 2019‑20 ‘black summer’. Meanwhile, Washington faces flooding and Alaska has power‑cutting gale winds."
