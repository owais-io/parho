title: "Trees Can Explode in Winter: Why It Happens"
summary: "When the cold hits hard, trees can crack like a broken pipe. They normally protect themselves with bark and lower the water in their cells, but a sudden drop can freeze that water. As ice expands, it pushes against the wood and can split the trunk, making a loud pop. The cracks invite insects and rot, but they’re not dangerous to people. It’s a strange, noisy winter shock."
