title: "Right‑wing media now control Pentagon press coverage"
summary: "The Pentagon’s new rules forced most mainstream reporters to quit, so the press corps is now filled with right‑wing activists and small conservative outlets. They must accept strict limits on what they can report and where they can go. Critics say this turns the Pentagon into a propaganda mouthpiece and violates free‑speech rights. Meanwhile, high‑profile incidents like the Signal chat and a drug‑boat strike show the need for independent scrutiny."
