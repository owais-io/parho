title: "New South Wales lawmakers want to ban the “globalise the intifada” chant when it’s used to stir hate"
summary: "New South Wales lawmakers want to ban the chant “globalise the intifada” when it is used to stir hatred or violence. The report, written by a Labor‑led committee, stops short of banning other slogans like “from the river to the sea”. Opponents say the move is confusing and only adds to existing laws. The bill could be voted on after parliament returns next week."
