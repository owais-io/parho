title: "Judge‑only trials won’t clear the crown court backlog, report says"
summary: "A new Institute for Government report says cutting jury trials to use judge‑only hearings will save less than 2 % of crown court time and only a 7‑10 % overall reduction in case‑processing time. The report argues that moving more cases to magistrates’ courts, boosting court staff and technology, and improving productivity would have a bigger impact. Legal experts and MPs criticize the plan for being controversial and likely damaging public trust."
