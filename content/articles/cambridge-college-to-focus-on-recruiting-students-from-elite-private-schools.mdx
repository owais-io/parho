title: "Cambridge college to focus on recruiting students from elite private schools"
summary: "Trinity Hall, a Cambridge college, plans to reach out to a few wealthy private schools—like Eton and Winchester—to attract students they believe will excel in subjects such as classics and music. This change conflicts with the college’s previous effort to admit more students from state schools and disadvantaged backgrounds. Staff and experts worry the move unfairly favours privileged pupils and may hurt diversity, even though the college says it still seeks the best talent from all schools."
