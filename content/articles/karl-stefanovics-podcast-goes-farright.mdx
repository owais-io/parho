title: "Karl Stefanovic’s Podcast Goes Far‑Right"
summary: "Karl Stefanovic, a well‑known Australian TV host, has launched a YouTube podcast that has quickly become popular among right‑wing listeners. The first shows feature anti‑immigration and anti‑woke guests, and the audience floods the live chat with support for parties like One Nation. Comments sometimes turn antisemitic or neo‑Nazi, and the host often mirrors the guests’ hard‑right views. Nine Media’s decision to let him leave mainstream TV has drawn criticism."
