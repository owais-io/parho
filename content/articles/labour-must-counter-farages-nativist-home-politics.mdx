title: "Labour Must Counter Farage’s Nativist “Home” Politics"
summary: "The article looks at how the idea of “home” is used in politics, especially by Nigel Farage’s new party. It starts with a German TV drama that celebrates local roots, then shows how Farage’s team turns the same idea into a promise that only some people can belong. The piece argues that this nativist stance is exclusionary and warns that Labour must find a better, more inclusive way to speak about belonging."
