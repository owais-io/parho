title: "Chinese Car Brands to Sell 10% of New Cars in UK by 2025"
summary: "Chinese car makers, especially MG, BYD, and Chery, are expected to sell about 200,000 new cars in the UK in 2025, making up 10% of all new car sales. This jump is part of a larger European trend, where China could hold up to 10% of the market by 2030. EU countries worry this could hurt local jobs, while tariffs only target pure electric cars, letting hybrids slip through."
