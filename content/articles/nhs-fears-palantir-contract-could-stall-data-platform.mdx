title: "NHS fears Palantir contract could stall data platform"
summary: "Health ministers chose Palantir, a U.S. surveillance firm, to build a £330 m AI system that links NHS records. But doctors, patients and MPs say Palantir’s ties to the U.S. military and immigration enforcement hurt the project’s credibility. Reports show the rollout has stalled, with fewer than half of English trusts using the software. Officials warn public doubt could cost money and delay the data platform."
