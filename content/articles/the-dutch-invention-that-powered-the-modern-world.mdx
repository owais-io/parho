title: "The Dutch invention that powered the modern world"
summary: "Back in the 1500s, Dutch inventor Cornelis Corneliszoon built the world’s first industrial machine in a sawmill. He turned the windmill’s spinning wheel into up‑and‑down motion that fed logs into a saw blade. This simple gear system let the Dutch produce ships and trade goods, turning the country into a maritime power. The same technology later helped the Dutch build New York. A recent book celebrates this forgotten breakthrough."
