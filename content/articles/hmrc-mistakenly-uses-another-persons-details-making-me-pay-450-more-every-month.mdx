title: "HMRC Mistakenly Uses Another Person's Details, Making Me Pay £450 More Every Month"
summary: "In November, HMRC mistakenly linked my National Insurance number to another person's details, making the system think I have a second job. Because of that, I'm now paying about £450 extra every month in tax and National Insurance. I've waited 90 minutes for help, but the issue hasn't been fixed yet. HMRC says it will refund the overpaid amount and pay me £75 in compensation. They said no data breach report was needed."
