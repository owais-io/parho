title: "Australia’s Housing Boom Could Turn Society into a Neo‑Feudal System"
summary: "Australia’s top tax expert, Bob Breunig, warns that the rapid rise in house values is making success largely depend on whether your parents own property. He says the current tax system still gives big transfers to older Australians even when they’re not poor, and the 50% capital‑gains discount encourages speculative buying. Breunig says cutting that discount won’t fix prices, but better targeting aid could help."
