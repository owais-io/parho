title: "Tonight Jupiter Is the Brightest Star in the Sky"
summary: "Tonight Jupiter will shine the brightest ever seen, because Earth is right between the planet and the Sun. After the wolf moon, the sky looks almost bright like day. You can spot Jupiter with the naked eye or a pair of binoculars. Its four big moons—Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, Io—are visible too. Io is a super‑volcanic world. Look up this clear winter night for a simple, amazing show."
