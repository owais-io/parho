title: "DHS Wants a $70 million Jet with Luxury Amenities for Deportation Flights"
summary: "The Department of Homeland Security is considering buying a Boeing 737‑8 Max that already comes with a bedroom, shower, kitchen, bar and four big TVs. Some officials think it’s odd to use such a fancy plane for moving up to 100 detainees at a time. The plan is to split the jet into a crew‑only cabin for deportations and a separate cabin for senior government travel. The purchase would save about 40 % on flight costs."
