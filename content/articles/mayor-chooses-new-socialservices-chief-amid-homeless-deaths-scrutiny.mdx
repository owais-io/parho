title: "Mayor Chooses New Social‑Services Chief Amid Homeless Deaths Scrutiny"
summary: "New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani has appointed former Pittsburgh official Erin Dalton as the city’s social‑services commissioner. The move follows at least 20 homeless people who died in a cold winter, prompting calls for better help. Critics say the mayor is restarting encampment sweeps and delaying promised housing aid. Mamdani says sweeps will be done by services workers, not police, and Dalton’s outreach experience should cut down tents. Homeless advocates hope the new team delivers more housing and support."
