title: "EU to speed up moving tanks and troops across Europe"
summary: "The EU wants to cut red tape so that armies and tanks can move faster around Europe. Right now moving a convoy from a western port to the eastern border takes days or weeks because of weak bridges, small tunnels and customs paperwork. The plan would create a “military Schengen” area, give convoys priority, and spend about €100 bn to strengthen roads, bridges and ports. It’s part of a 2030 security push to be ready if Russia attacks."
