title: "Arkansas Women Sue Over Abortion Ban That Endangered Them"
summary: "Four Arkansas women who were denied abortions because of the state's near‑total ban have filed a lawsuit, saying the laws put their health and safety at risk. They say doctors were blocked from providing life‑saving care, and many had to travel to other states for treatment, often incurring huge costs and danger. The suit argues the bans are vague and unconstitutional, violating Arkansas’ own guarantees of equality and liberty."
