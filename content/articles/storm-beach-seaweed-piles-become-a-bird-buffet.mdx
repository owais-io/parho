title: "Storm beach seaweed piles become a bird buffet"
summary: "During a British Trust for Ornithology survey, researchers found that piles of rotting seaweed on a storm‑tide beach become a huge food source for birds. The wrack, made of kelp and invasive sargassum, breaks down into insects, shrimp‑like creatures and worms, which attract waders, rooks, skylarks, choughs and even crows. In spring the tide spreads the wrack, drawing in gulls, wigeons, fish and rare raptors such as hen harrier and merlin."
