title: "Supreme Court May Let Trump Remove FTC Member"
summary: "The U.S. Supreme Court is leaning toward allowing President Trump to fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission, a group that has been protected from presidential kicks for more than a century. Conservatives, including Justice Barrett, seem to support the move, while a lower court said Trump exceeded his authority. If the decision goes through, it could undo a 1935 ruling that kept agency heads independent."
