title: "Dishes That a Vegetarian and a Meat Lover Can Both Enjoy"
summary: "Looking for meals that satisfy both a vegetarian and a meat lover? Try a Chinese stir‑fry of eggplant, potatoes, peppers and tofu—cheap and comforting. Mushrooms can replace meat in lasagna, kebabs, or stews, adding umami with soy and miso. Combine beans, roasted cauliflower or pumpkin with a touch of chicken or pork for a balanced plate. Even dumplings work, stuffing half with veggie, half with meat. Simple swaps keep everyone happy."
