title: "Reform UK hires former Tory ally to draft nature policies"
summary: "Reform UK is courting voters who care about the environment by hiring former Tory environmentalist Ben Goldsmith to help write its nature policies. Goldsmith will advise on issues such as fishing, protecting the green belt and stopping destructive bottom‑trawling, but he won't join the party. The move aims to win over Conservative voters who feel Nigel Farage’s party is too skeptical about climate action, while also challenging Labour’s stance on marine protection."
