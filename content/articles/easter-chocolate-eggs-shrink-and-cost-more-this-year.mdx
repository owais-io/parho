title: "Easter chocolate eggs shrink and cost more this year"
summary: "Supermarket Easter chocolate eggs are smaller and pricier this year. Chocolate makers like Maltesers, Cadbury and Lindt have cut the weight of their eggs by 5‑10 %, while the price of a pack goes up 20‑40 %. The changes come from higher cocoa, sugar, energy and labour costs after poor harvests in West Africa. Retailers are setting new prices, so shoppers find a larger egg costs more than last year."
