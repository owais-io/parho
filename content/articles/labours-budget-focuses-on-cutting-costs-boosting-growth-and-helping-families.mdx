title: "Labour’s Budget Focuses on Cutting Costs, Boosting Growth and Helping Families"
summary: "Labour’s budget slashes energy bills by about £150 and removes the two‑child limit to help families. It raises fair taxes, keeps inflation down and reduces debt costs. The government also promises £120 bn of investment in roads, rail, and energy, new planning rules, airport expansion, and trade deals with the EU, India and the US. Starmer says the plan is about growing the economy, easing needless rules, helping young people with health issues, and re‑building trade after Brexit."
