title: "Lamar Jackson’s talent can’t save a Ravens team that keeps falling behind"
summary: "The Ravens lost a close 26‑24 game to the Steelers, a match that highlighted the team’s ongoing struggles. Coach John Harbaugh’s decision to kneel instead of trying to score a field goal in the final seconds proved costly. The season has been hampered by injuries, shaky play, and a defense that couldn’t hold in crunch time. With Jackson’s contract ending soon, the team is looking at a possible coaching change to spark a new direction."
