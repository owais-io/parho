title: "EU to Decide Whether to Use Frozen Russian Money to Fund Ukraine"
summary: "EU leaders will decide Thursday whether to tap €210bn of frozen Russian assets to give Ukraine a €90bn loan. The plan borrows from Euroclear, with Kyiv repaying only when Russia pays reparations. Germany backs it, Belgium objects, citing legal risks. A no‑deal would damage EU credibility. If agreed, the loan would still need law‑making and future funds for rebuilding."
