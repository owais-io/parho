summary: "People in Iran are still protesting, but many feel the government will not fall. After the 2009 uprising, protests flare up and are quickly silenced, then start again. The government ignores demands for democracy, while foreign powers, especially the US, add pressure. Fear of violence and war makes Iranians cautious, and the hope for real reform looks far in the future."
