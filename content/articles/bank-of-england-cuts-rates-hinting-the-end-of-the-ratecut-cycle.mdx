title: "Bank of England cuts rates, hinting the end of the rate‑cut cycle"
summary: "After last month’s budget, the Bank of England lowered the base rate from 4 % to 3.75 %, easing pressure on borrowers. The rate‑cut cycle is still ongoing, but officials say each cut makes it harder to keep cutting. Inflation slowed to 3.2 % in November and the economy is flat‑lining. The government’s spending cuts are expected to trim inflation by 0.5 pp, helping hit the 2 % target sooner, though high wages still pose a risk. The end of cuts looks nearer."
