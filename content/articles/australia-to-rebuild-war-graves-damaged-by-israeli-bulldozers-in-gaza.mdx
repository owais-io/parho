title: "Australia to Rebuild War Graves Damaged by Israeli Bulldozers in Gaza"
summary: "Australia says it will repair the graves of its soldiers in Gaza that were destroyed by Israeli bulldozers. Satellite photos and witnesses show headstones gone and soil disturbed. The job may take months or years because access to the cemetery is blocked by the fighting. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission will clean up when it can, but the area remains dangerous. Israel says the work was a defensive move."
