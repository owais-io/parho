title: "Algorithm Cuts Aged‑Care Support for Adelaide Woman, Forcing Her to Consider Moving"
summary: "78‑year‑old Jean Mathew in Adelaide is losing a lot of support money because a computer tool called the Integrated Assessment Tool (IAT) says she needs less help. The IAT cut her funding from $163,000 to $58,000 a year, leaving her with only a couple of support hours a day. She and her supporters say the algorithm ignores her real needs and could force her into an aged‑care home. She wants an appeal, but no decision has been made yet."
