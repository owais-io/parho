title: "Labour's Budget: Good for Children, but Economic Risks Remain"
summary: "Labour's budget adds measures like raising the two‑child benefit cap, adding gambling taxes, freezing rail fares, and a mansion tax. It also plans a shift from North Sea oil toward clean energy. But the plan still raises £26 bn in taxes on workers and could cut services such as councils, courts and police. The Treasury sees modest growth, while the OBR warns of deep cuts and slow progress. Despite the risks, the budget lifts many children out of poverty."
