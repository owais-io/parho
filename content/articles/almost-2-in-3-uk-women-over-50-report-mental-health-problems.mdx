title: "Almost 2 in 3 UK Women Over 50 Report Mental Health Problems"
summary: "Survey of 2,000 UK women aged 50+ shows that about 60% have mental health problems. Menopause, brain fog, relationship breaks, and money worries are common triggers. Most of them keep quiet – 9 out of 10 say they don't talk about it, fearing they'd burden others or be misunderstood. This silence leads to sleep issues, weight changes, and social withdrawal. The BACP urges therapy and awareness of mid‑life mental health."
