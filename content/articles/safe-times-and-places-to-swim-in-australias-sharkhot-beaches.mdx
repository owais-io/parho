title: "Safe Times and Places to Swim in Australia’s Shark‑Hot Beaches"
summary: "Sharks in Australia are more likely to bite when waters warm, after heavy rain, or at low‑light times like dawn and dusk. Bull sharks, the biggest risk, often move up rivers and estuaries when storms loom, while tiger and great white sharks favor warmer or cooler waters respectively. To stay safe, swim between the red and yellow safety flags, avoid bright colours, surf in groups, and stay aware of weather changes."
