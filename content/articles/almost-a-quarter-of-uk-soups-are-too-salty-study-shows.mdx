title: "Almost a Quarter of UK Soups Are Too Salty, Study Shows"
summary: "Researchers tested nearly 500 soups in UK supermarkets and found that about 23 % have more salt than the government’s voluntary target. Nearly half of branded soups and only 6 % of store‑brand soups are over‑salted. Some soups contain as much salt as two McDonald’s cheeseburgers. High salt intake can raise blood pressure and heart risk. Brands and retailers say they’re working to cut salt, but the government must act faster."
