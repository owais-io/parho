Iran is trying to look friendlier to other Middle‑East countries after a U.S. bombing and an Israeli attack on its diplomats. Tehran says the U.S. has broken international rules and says it can build new ties with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar. But while it pushes this new image, Iran still keeps its nuclear program, strengthens air defences and faces heavy domestic unrest, high inflation, arrests and a crackdown on freedom.
