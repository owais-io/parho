title: "Guardian investigation finds a group encouraging women to give birth without medical help"
summary: "A year‑long Guardian probe looks at the Free Birth Society (FBS), a U.S. company that sells courses and podcasts teaching women how to deliver babies without any medical support. The report says FBS tells moms to avoid doctors, midwives, and ultrasounds, and promotes the idea that unassisted birth is safe. It links the group to at least 48 stillbirths or serious baby deaths and shows how its “radical responsibility” mindset puts the blame on mothers when problems arise."
