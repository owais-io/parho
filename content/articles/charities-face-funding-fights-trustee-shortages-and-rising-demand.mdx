title: "Charities Face Funding Fights, Trustee Shortages and Rising Demand"
summary: "Charity organisations are being forced to shape their projects to meet funder targets, which often means they are not doing what local communities actually need. Trustees are stepping down because the role is too demanding, leaving charities weak in oversight. Cuts to state benefits mean more people rely on charities for food and essentials. Free advice charities are underfunded and overworked, and many worry they won’t survive. The writers urge the government to invest more to keep these services alive."
