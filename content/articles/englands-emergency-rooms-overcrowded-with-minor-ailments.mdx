title: "England’s Emergency Rooms Overcrowded with Minor Ailments"
summary: "In England, emergency rooms are now crowded with people who have nothing life‑threatening, like coughs, hiccups or blocked noses. Data show a near ten‑fold jump in cough visits and over 2 million patients found no problem in 2024‑25. The rise reflects shortages in primary‑care slots and a lack of funding for GPs. Health officials say more community clinics, pharmacies and online help should be used instead."
