title: "Scotland’s Climate Plan Faces Criticism Over Unrealistic Targets"
summary: "The UK climate watchdog said Scotland’s new emissions plans look realistic for the next five years, but the long‑term goals are shaky. 91 % of 2030 cuts seem doable, but only 64 % for 2035 and 58 % for 2040 are credible. Critics point to weak plans for heat‑pump rollout, heavy reliance on untested carbon‑capture tech, and costly peat‑land restoration. Despite progress on electric cars and wind power, the strategy still feels like “science fiction.”"
