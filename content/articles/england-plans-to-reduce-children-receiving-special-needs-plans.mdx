title: "England Plans to Reduce Children Receiving Special Needs Plans"
summary: "England’s education secretary announced a big change to how children with special needs get support. The new rules will cut the number of legal Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) and replace most of them with less‑formal Individual Support Plans made by schools. The move is aimed at easing pressure on local councils, but teachers, unions and some MPs worry it could leave children without the right support and legal appeals."
