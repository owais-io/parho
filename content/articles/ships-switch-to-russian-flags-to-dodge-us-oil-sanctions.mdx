title: "Ships Switch to Russian Flags to Dodge US Oil Sanctions"
summary: "In the last year, around 40 ships tied to a so‑called “shadow fleet” have changed their flags to Russia to avoid US sanctions on Venezuelan and other oil. The move grew after Donald Trump warned of a US blockade of such tankers. The U.S. has seized several of these vessels, like the Marinera, while Russia tries to protect them with military support. The practice fuels Russia’s war effort and costs billions each year."
