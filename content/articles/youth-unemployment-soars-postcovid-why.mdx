title: "Youth Unemployment Soars Post‑Covid – Why?"
summary: "Youth unemployment in the UK is the highest in ten years, hovering around 15%. The rise is driven by a weak economy, higher hiring costs, and new tax rules that make part‑time jobs costlier for employers. Higher minimum wages for 18‑21 year olds also scare small businesses. Automation and AI are replacing routine jobs, while the pandemic left many young people with mental‑health challenges and lost education time."
