title: "One dose of psychedelic drug helps treat depression, study shows"
summary: "Scientists tested the psychedelic drug DMT on 34 people with treatment‑resistant depression. After a single 21.5 mg dose delivered by IV, and with therapy, patients felt better almost immediately and many kept improvements for 3–6 months. The study found no extra benefit from a second dose. DMT’s 25‑minute trip is shorter than psilocybin, which may make clinics easier to run. If approved, treatment would likely be offered in private clinics, raising safety and access questions."
