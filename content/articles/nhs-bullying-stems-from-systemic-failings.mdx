title: "NHS Bullying Stems from Systemic Failings"
summary: "A former research fellow who joined the NHS after a PhD says he was bullied by senior leaders for two years at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. He was told to work “until I drop,” mocked for his clothes, and found the director involved too. He says bullying is not just individual but comes from the system – leaders who become managers and keep a toxic culture. The writer calls for a big NHS overhaul and better support for staff."
