title: "London Stocks Stay Calm After Trump Tariff Threats"
summary: "London’s FTSE slipped just 0.4% after President Trump warned he could impose tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK. Markets stayed relatively calm because traders think Trump’s threats usually end up softer or delayed. While a long‑term risk of recession or higher borrowing costs still exists, investors are more worried about possible retaliatory measures that could hit capital markets. Europe’s large holdings of US debt add another layer of uncertainty."
