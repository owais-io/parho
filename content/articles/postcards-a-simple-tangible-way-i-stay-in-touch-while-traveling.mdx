title: "Postcards: A Simple, Tangible Way I Stay in Touch While Traveling"
summary: "Postcards keep me connected while traveling. I pick a picture that shows the place, write a short note, add a stamp, and drop it in a postbox. The card is real, not an Instagram story or a WhatsApp ping, and it gives the receiver a piece of my day. During Covid I sent them to friends and even a child, and they brought smiles back home."
