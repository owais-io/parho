title: "Starmer Avoids Raising China’s Rapid Nuclear Build‑up in Meeting with Xi"
summary: "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, but he didn’t mention China’s fast‑growing nuclear weapons program. A 2025 SIPRI report says China is adding about 100 new warheads each year, closing the gap with the U.S. and Russia. Global arms‑control talks are stalled, and the U.S. warns China could threaten U.S. forces in the Pacific or win a war in Taiwan by 2027. With no multilateral talks, the world faces a rising nuclear threat."
