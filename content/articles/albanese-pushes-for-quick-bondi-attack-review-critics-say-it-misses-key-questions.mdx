title: "Albanese pushes for quick Bondi attack review, critics say it misses key questions"
summary: "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants a five‑month, behind‑closed‑doors review led by former spy chief Dennis Richardson to find out what the federal security agencies did before the Bondi beach terror attack. The review will look at Asio, AFP and ASIS, and whether they shared information and knew about the gunmen. It won’t cover the wider problem of antisemitism or hold public hearings. Some people want a full royal commission that could examine everything and call witnesses."
