title: "Many Democracies Reject Trump‑Led Peace Board"
summary: "A new UN‑backed board intended to help end the Gaza conflict is now led by former President Donald Trump. Most countries, especially democracies, refuse to join because the board gives Trump too much power, allowing him to interfere in other nations’ affairs. Only about 20 countries have signed up, and many western allies plan to stay away. The board’s charter makes Trump chair‑for‑life and lets him veto decisions, raising concerns about independence and the UN’s role."
