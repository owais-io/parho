title: "UK Govt to Offer Jobs and Training for Young People"
summary: "Pat McFadden, the UK Work Secretary, says the government has let young people fall behind. Numbers of NEETs (not in education, employment or training) have jumped 50% since 2021, and mental‑health problems are up 76%. Instead of just giving benefits, the government will spend £820 million on a ‘youth guarantee’ that gives training, apprenticeships and paid work experience. It also wants more short courses where employers need skills. The aim is to give young people hope and real jobs."
