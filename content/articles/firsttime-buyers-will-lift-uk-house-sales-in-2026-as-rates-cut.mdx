title: "First‑time buyers will lift UK house sales in 2026 as rates cut"
summary: "First‑time buyers are set to boost UK house sales in 2026 as the Bank of England keeps cutting rates. Prices are expected to rise only 2‑4 % and rents should grow slower. Mortgage costs are the lowest for new buyers since 2022, thanks to lower rates and looser rules. London’s prices may stay flat, while the north gains more. Overall, the market feels steady but still slow."
