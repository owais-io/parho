title: "China’s Xi Shows Little Interest in Britain’s Visit"
summary: "Keir Starmer wanted to visit China to impress his MPs and follow other leaders’ trips. China, led by Xi, didn’t care much unless the UK approved a new “mega embassy” near London. Xi demanded a joint press statement, not a deep talk, and the meeting lasted only 40 minutes. The trip gave a few perks, like 30‑day visa‑free visits, but most of the talks were bland and short."
