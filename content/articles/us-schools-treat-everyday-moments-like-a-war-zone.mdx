title: "US schools treat everyday moments like a war zone"
summary: "The new HBO film *Thoughts and Prayers* shows how U.S. schools now run lockdown drills, use bulletproof backpacks, and even play video‑game‑style shooting simulations. Parents and teachers, many of whom grew up without such measures, feel uneasy. Ex‑military and police run the safety industry, treating schools like war zones. The film argues that without real policy changes, we’ll keep adding stop‑gap gadgets instead of solving the problem. Kids talk openly about their fears."
