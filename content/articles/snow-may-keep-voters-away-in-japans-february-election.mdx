title: "Snow May Keep Voters Away in Japan's February Election"
summary: "Japan’s snap election on Feb. 8 faces a brutal winter. Record snowfall in many areas has buried billboards, cut transport and raised fears that voters will stay home. With only 16 days to campaign, the ruling LDP can’t rely on its usual Komeito voters and must attract undecided voters, while police worry that winter body‑warmers could trigger metal‑detector alarms. Younger voters seem more willing to brave the cold, but overall turnout could fall."
