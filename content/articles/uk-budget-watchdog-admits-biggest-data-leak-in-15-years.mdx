title: "UK budget watchdog admits biggest data leak in 15 years"
summary: "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says it made the biggest mistake in its 15‑year history when its budget documents appeared online an hour before Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s speech. An investigation found the leak was due to weak procedures and pressure on a small team, and that a similar early release happened in March. The OBR will review its systems, and the Treasury and Cabinet Office are also partly to blame. The OBR chief has apologized and may step down."
