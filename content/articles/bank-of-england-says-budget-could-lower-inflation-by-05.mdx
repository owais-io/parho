title: "Bank of England Says Budget Could Lower Inflation by 0.5%"
summary: "The Bank of England says the chancellor’s budget could lower the UK’s inflation rate by about 0.4‑0.5 percentage points next year. Most of the drop would come from cutting energy subsidies, freezing fuel duty, and reducing rail fares. The bank will keep these plans in mind when it decides on interest rates, which may fall to 3.75% soon. Though the short‑term cut is welcome, other spending and higher wages could push prices up later."
