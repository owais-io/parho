title: "Hampstead Heath cafés face threat from corporate takeover"
summary: "Hampstead Heath’s family‑owned cafés are again under threat from a corporate chain. A former committee chair, Rhiannon Cosslett, recalls 2016 when a vote would have handed the Parliament Hill café to Benugo, a big chain. Protesters forced the decision back, and Benugo withdrew. Now Daisy Green, a growing Australian‑style chain, is pushing to take over four cafés. Local residents worry the City Corporation wants to turn the park into a cash‑generating business."
