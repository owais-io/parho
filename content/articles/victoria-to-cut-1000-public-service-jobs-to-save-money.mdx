summary: "Victoria will cut 1,000 public service jobs, including 300 senior roles, after a review said it could cut 2,000. The move should save about $4 billion in four years. It also will merge or close many government bodies, like VicHealth, and cut extra advisory committees. The treasurer says the cuts help families who watch every dollar.
