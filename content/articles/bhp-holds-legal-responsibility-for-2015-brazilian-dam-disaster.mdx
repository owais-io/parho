title: "BHP Holds Legal Responsibility for 2015 Brazilian Dam Disaster"
summary: "A London court said BHP must pay for the 2015 collapse of a tailings dam in Brazil that killed 19 people and dumped toxic waste into a major river. Even though BHP didn’t own the dam at the time, the judge found its role in the company that ran the mine made the disaster foreseeable. The ruling opens the door to a huge payout for affected Brazilians, while BHP plans to appeal. The case adds to the already huge settlement Brazil reached with the mining companies."
