title: "Horses Can Smell Human Fear, Study Finds"
summary: "Researchers found that horses can sense human fear through smell. They tested horses with sweat from people watching scary movies and from watching cheerful films. The horses smelled the sweat from the scared people and got spooked more, had higher heart rates, and stayed farther from their handlers. The study suggests that horse‑human interactions can be affected by our emotions, so riders should stay calm."
