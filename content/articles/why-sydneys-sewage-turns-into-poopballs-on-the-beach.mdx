title: "Why Sydney’s Sewage Turns Into Poop‑Balls on the Beach"
summary: "Sydney pumps 1.5 billion litres of raw sewage into the ocean every day, using only basic sedimentation tanks. The waste is sent 2–4 km offshore where currents dilute it. A huge fat‑ball stuck in the Malabar plant caused “poop‑balls” that washed up on beaches in 2024‑25. Because expanding coastal plants would need costly land, Sydney plans to build new inland facilities to treat sewage before it reaches the coast."
