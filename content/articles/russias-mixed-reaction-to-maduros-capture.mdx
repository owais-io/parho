title: "Russia’s Mixed Reaction to Maduro’s Capture"
summary: "Russia reacted strongly after President Nicolás Maduro was seized by a US‑led operation. Moscow called the raid illegal and said it undermines the rules‑based world order. Some Russian officials oddly praised how quick and smooth the takeover was, seeing it as proof of how Russia’s own plans had failed. The move hurts Moscow’s interests: it loses access to Venezuelan weapons, loans and oil, and must keep its focus on Ukraine."
