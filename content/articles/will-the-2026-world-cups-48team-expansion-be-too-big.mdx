summary: "FIFA’s 2026 World Cup will have 48 teams and 104 games, a big jump from the 32‑team format. Some worry it’ll dilute excitement, with easy wins for big teams and predictable group stages. Politically, the US, Mexico and Canada hosting and links to Trump raise questions. Ticket prices could be high, and travel across North America will add a lot of carbon emissions. FIFA is also tweaking rules to protect top teams."
