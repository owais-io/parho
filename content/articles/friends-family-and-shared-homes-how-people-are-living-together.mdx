summary: "Across the world, some people are putting down roots with friends and relatives instead of living alone. In Atlanta, a 65‑year‑old shares a house with her mother, daughter and friend. In Berlin, a group of couples bought a farmhouse and bond over chores and music. Other stories show single parents sharing homes, divorcing moms pooling a house, and a Chicago co‑op that lets families stay affordable. Living together gives emotional support, saves money and feels like family."
