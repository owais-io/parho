title: "Southbank Centre gets heritage protection, but funding still needed"
summary: "London’s Southbank Centre, a big post‑war arts complex, has been given Grade II‑listed status, meaning it is now protected as a historic building. The move is seen as a win for Britain’s modern‑era architecture, which was once criticised as ugly. But the centre still needs money to stay open, and ministers will have to support artists and the £30 million help the venue has asked for."
