title: "Saudi Arabia and UAE Split: What It Means for the Region"
summary: "The split started after the 2017 Qatar blockade, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE were close allies. They backed each other against Islamist movements. In 2023 the relationship soured—Saudi leaders accused the UAE of betrayal, and UAE‑backed forces pushed Saudi troops back. Now they pursue different goals: Saudi seeks domestic reform and stability, while the UAE pushes hard to curb Islamist parties, allies Israel. The fallout could make Middle‑East reconstruction and a Palestinian state harder."
