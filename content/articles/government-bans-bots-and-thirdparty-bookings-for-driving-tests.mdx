title: "Government Bans Bots and Third‑Party Bookings for Driving Tests"
summary: "To tackle a backlog of nearly 670,000 driving tests, the UK government will stop bots and third‑party sellers from booking slots. Only learner drivers can book themselves, and they can only change a booking twice before cancelling. Learners will also be limited to nearby test centres. The move comes as examiners are recruited, paid a £5,000 retention bonus, and the military will add 36 examiners to help cut waiting times."
