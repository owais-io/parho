title: "Period Blood Test May Replace Traditional Cervical Cancer Screening"
summary: "Period blood test shows promise as a non‑invasive cervical cancer screening that could be done at home, according to a large study in China. Researchers collected menstrual blood on a pad with a strip and found it identified abnormal cells (CIN2/3) with 94.7 % sensitivity—about the same as clinician‑taken samples. Specificity was similar, and referrals for follow‑up matched. The test could help women who skip clinic visits, but larger trials are needed."
