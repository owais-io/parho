title: "RFK Jr’s Misinformation Is Harmful, But State Anti‑Science Bills Pose an Even Bigger Threat"
summary: "RFK Jr. spreads dangerous myths about vaccines and fluoridation, and his moves in the Trump health department add to the problem. Yet many states are passing or already have laws that weaken science—banning vaccines, legalizing raw milk, and stopping water fluoridation. Over 420 such bills have been introduced, and some have become law. Public health groups are fighting back by coordinating data, running science‑based campaigns, and trying to rebuild trust."
