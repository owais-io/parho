summary: "Since Mahsa Amini’s death, Iranian women in Tehran and other cities have begun walking streets without hijabs, even though new 2024 laws punish such actions with fines, flogging, or up to 15 years in jail. The government urges citizens to report violators, but many see the crackdown as a distraction from water shortages, protests and war. Despite arrests, women say they won’t stop, saying the regime can’t afford mass arrests."
