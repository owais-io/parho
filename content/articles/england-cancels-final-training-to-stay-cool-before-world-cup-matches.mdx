title: "England Cancels Final Training to Stay Cool Before World Cup Matches"
summary: "England’s T20 World Cup squad has pulled the last practice session to avoid a long 3‑hour trip to Navi Mumbai and to keep players cool in Mumbai’s February heat. The move leaves them with one fewer warm‑up game, but managers say the risk of fatigue outweighs the benefit of a short session. The team will face Nepal first, then West Indies, while their opponents are in good form and a big Nepali crowd is expected."
