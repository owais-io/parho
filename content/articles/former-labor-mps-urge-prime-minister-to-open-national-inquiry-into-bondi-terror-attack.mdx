title: "Former Labor MPs Urge Prime Minister to Open National Inquiry into Bondi Terror Attack"
summary: "Former Labor MPs and allies are urging the prime minister to launch a national royal commission to investigate antisemitism and the Bondi beach shooting that killed 15 people. They say a federal inquiry should examine online hate, how it was used by the attacker, and whether police and intelligence could have stopped it. Prime Minister Albanese has resisted, preferring a quicker review led by former ASIO chief Dennis Richardson, and has promised faster action instead."
