title: "Kemi Badenoch's recent rise: is she finally pulling the Tory party together?"
summary: "Kemi Badenoch took over a broken Conservative party after a crushing election loss. Her first year was shaky and poll numbers were low. A big boost came after a confident speech at the party conference, which made MPs feel better and helped her win some debate points. Inside the party, people say she’s gaining confidence and the party’s mood is improving, but overall support is still weak. Upcoming elections and rivals like Reform UK still threaten her position."
