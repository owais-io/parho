title: "Labour's plan to tighten human‑rights rules could help or harm the far right"
summary: "Labour wants to make the EU’s human‑rights rules stricter so it can stop migrants and deport criminals more easily. At a European summit Britain joined other right‑wing governments to push for a tighter version of the European Convention on Human Rights, limiting claims that block deportation and broadening what counts as ‘treatment’. Rights groups warn this could open the door to abuse, while Labour says it will curb the far right from exploiting the law."
