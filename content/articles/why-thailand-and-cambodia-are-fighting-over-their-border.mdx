title: "Why Thailand and Cambodia Are Fighting Over Their Border"
summary: "The border between Thailand and Cambodia is over 500 miles long. In 2025, a Thai soldier stepped on a landmine and a Cambodian soldier was killed, sparking national anger. Both sides banned each other’s goods and fighting escalated into a five‑day war that left 48 dead and displaced 300,000 people. A ceasefire signed in Malaysia in October was broken when another landmine injured a Thai soldier. Recent airstrikes have reignited tension again."
