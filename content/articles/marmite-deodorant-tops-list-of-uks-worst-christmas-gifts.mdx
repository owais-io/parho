title: "Marmite deodorant tops list of UK’s worst Christmas gifts"
summary: "A study by consumer group Which? found that one in five Britons got an unwanted present last Christmas. The most hated gifts were Marmite‑framed deodorant and worn pyjamas, plus odd items like rotten coconut. Some people even got helicopter rides from a daughter who didn’t know their fear of flying. About a third kept or used the gifts; a third threw them away. The study reminds shoppers to ask for gift receipts so returns are easy."
