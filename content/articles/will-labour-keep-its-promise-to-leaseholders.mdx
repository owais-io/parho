title: "Will Labour Keep Its Promise to Leaseholders?"
summary: "The UK prime minister said the government should help people struggling with living costs. Labour has promised to end the high, rising ground‑rent charges that many lease‑owners pay to investors. Millions of families now owe hundreds of pounds a year with no service in return, and the cost can double every decade. Investors lobby to keep the system, but Labour says it can replace it with a fair cap. If it fails, voters may lose faith in the party."
