title: "Long wait times for disability benefits push people into poverty – a faster fix is needed"
summary: "Many people with disabilities in the UK are waiting months, even years, for the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) that helps cover extra living costs. Those delays push them into debt and poverty, especially when PIP unlocks other benefits. The government promises an online system to speed things up, but it hasn't worked yet. MPs warn the delay is a real problem that needs quick action, not more promises."
