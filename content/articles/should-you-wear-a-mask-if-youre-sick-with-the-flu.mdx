title: "Should you wear a mask if you’re sick with the flu?"
summary: "An NHS leader says anyone with flu‑like symptoms should wear a mask in public, but the government says it’s only a recommendation. Masks can cut the spread of flu and protect you too. This winter’s flu is early and severe, with more hospitalised patients than last year, driven by a new influenza A strain. Flu shots are available to people 65+, at risk, and certain others, and the current vaccine covers the new strain. If you feel unwell, rest, stay hydrated, take pain relief, and call NHS 111 if you’re in a high‑risk group or symptoms worsen."
