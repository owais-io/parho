title: "Trump ramps up covert attack on Venezuela, but Maduro stays in power"
summary: "Trump said the U.S. carried out its first ground strike in Venezuela, but details are sparse and no casualties were reported. The move is part of a larger U.S. campaign that includes a massive naval presence, airstrikes that have killed 107 people, and a blockade of oil ships. Experts think the strike likely had little effect, and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro remains in power while U.S. political pressure continues."
