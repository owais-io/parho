title: "Victoria Police May Unfairly Target African‑Looking People in Warrantless Searches"
summary: "A Guardian analysis found that Victorian police may be unfairly stopping and searching people who look African. Searches that find drugs or weapons were 27% less likely to turn up evidence for those people compared to white‑looking people. Police have not been required to record ethnicity for about 20% of stops, despite a 2013 promise to monitor profiling. Community leaders say stops happen without clear reason, while police say they only act on behaviour."
