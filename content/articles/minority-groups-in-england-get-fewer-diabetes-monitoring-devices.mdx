title: "Minority Groups in England Get Fewer Diabetes Monitoring Devices"
summary: "New research shows that in England people from black and South Asian communities are less likely to get continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), even though they have higher rates of diabetes. The study looked at prescription data and found large gaps across health boards. NICE says all adults with diabetes should have access, but the guidelines aren’t being followed everywhere. Experts say the difference is due to structural barriers and call for targeted action to give everyone the technology they need."
