summary: "Guy Hochman, an Israeli comedian and former soldier, was held for six hours at Toronto Pearson airport after a pro‑Palestinian group filed a complaint accusing him of war crimes and genocide‑incitement in Gaza. The Israeli consulate helped release him, and he went on to perform as scheduled. The same group also asked U.S. authorities to investigate him, citing his role in a mosque‑destruction video and calls for violence.
