title: "Labour’s Dual‑Nationality Rule Criticised in Letters"
summary: "The Guardian's letter column shows readers taking issue with Labour's new rule that limits travel for dual‑national citizens. Some writers argue the policy is illiberal and unnecessary, suggesting a simpler electronic travel permit would fix it. Other letters touch on unrelated topics like local election changes, crossword clues, and old‑school bed warmers, giving a varied look at everyday concerns. Readers also ask for more clarity on how these rules affect ordinary voters."
