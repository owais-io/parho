summary: "I’m a mother who misses having a child that stays home with me, but my adult sons leave after holidays. I read about a growing trend called “stay‑at‑home sons”—young men who live with their parents. While some proudly embrace it, most kids prefer independence. The piece also humorously mentions a baby tortoise I had to keep alive during winter, adding a quirky touch."
