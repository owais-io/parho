title: "Old Trafford to be added to the UK’s 2035 Women’s World Cup stadium list"
summary: "FA plans to include a rebuilt Old Trafford in the UK’s 2035 Women’s World Cup venues, announced this week. Manchester United’s proposed 100,000‑seat stadium is still just drawings, and its funding remains unclear. Manchester City’s Etihad will host England’s opening game. The UK is the only bidder, but FIFA won’t decide final venues until 2030. The FA says putting Old Trafford on a final‑match list is premature, though the club wants it. Other UK cities also seek inclusion."
