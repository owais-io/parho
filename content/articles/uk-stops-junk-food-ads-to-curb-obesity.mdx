title: "UK stops junk food ads to curb obesity"
summary: "UK government has introduced rules that ban ads for high‑fat, high‑sugar, high‑salt foods on TV before 9 p.m. and online at any time. The move is aimed at cutting children’s exposure to junk‑food marketing and tackling rising obesity rates – 27 % of UK kids are overweight or obese.
