title: "X's UK Revenue Falls 60% as Advertisers Pull Back"
summary: "X saw UK revenue drop 58.3% from £69.1m to £28.9m in 2024, mainly because advertisers cut spending after concerns over offensive content. After Musk took over in 2022, X shut its AI image tool that was used to create sexualized images, and 80% of UK staff were let go. The company says it’s building safety tools, has sued some big brands over a boycott, but profits are still down."
