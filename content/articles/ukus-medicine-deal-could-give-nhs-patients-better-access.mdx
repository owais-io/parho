title: "UK‑US medicine deal could give NHS patients better access"
summary: "UK and US signed a medicines deal that raises the cost bar for NHS drug approval, so more new treatments can be tested. It caps NHS payments for new medicines at 15% from 2026‑28 and keeps older drugs’ prices unchanged. The agreement aims to catch up with other countries that get faster access to cutting‑edge drugs. Some critics worry it gives Washington more say over UK tech and sovereignty, but supporters say it will help patients."
