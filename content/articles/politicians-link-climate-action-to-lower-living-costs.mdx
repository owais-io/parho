title: "Politicians Link Climate Action to Lower Living Costs"
summary: "Progressive leaders are telling voters that fighting climate change can also cut everyday costs like rent and utility bills. They say rising temperatures make heating, water and insurance more expensive, and that green jobs and cheaper energy can help. Mayors in New York, Seattle and others are pushing free buses and better building insulation. Labor unions and tenant groups want solar panels, job training and protections against disaster‑related eviction. New laws in Vermont and New York let polluters pay for damage."
