title: "2025 Political Cartoons: Trump, Putin, Prince Andrew, and More"
summary: "Cartoonists in 2025 used their drawings to poke fun at powerful people like Trump, Putin, and Prince Andrew while also finding hope in small victories such as a Gaza ceasefire or a New York election win. They said humor can expose bad leaders, but also bring light to serious events. The year felt repetitive with wars, scandals, and political drama, yet cartoons remained a quick way to highlight chaos and make people think."
