title: "US and EU rail upgrade could force 6,500 people to leave Congo homes"
summary: "A multi‑billion‑dollar railway upgrade by the US and EU could push 6,500 people out of their homes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, especially in the mining town of Kolwezi, Global Witness says. The plan, called the Lobito Corridor, aims to improve the old Benguela rail line to Angola’s coast and export copper, cobalt and other minerals for green‑energy tech. Residents fear forced evictions without payment, and there are disagreements over the no‑construction buffer zone around the tracks."
