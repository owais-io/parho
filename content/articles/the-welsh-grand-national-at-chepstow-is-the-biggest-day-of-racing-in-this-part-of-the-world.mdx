title: "The Welsh Grand National at Chepstow is the biggest day of racing in this part of the world."
summary: "It’s a long, classic chase that has produced some great moments over the years.   The track is a tight, hill‑shaped circuit. The weight on the top horse this year is very high, but it is an outsider with a long way to go.   The main favourites are the horses that did well in the trial race earlier this month.   A few other runners have a good chance. One is from a small yard in the countryside, and another is a strong performer that usually does well.   There are also a few well‑known names that can’t be ignored.   The card is full of excitement. Five races run in the afternoon, including a junior hurdle at 1:40 pm.   After that, the meeting moves to Kempton for the King George. The main event there is a novice chase at 1:55 pm.   This is a very lively day. The crowds are huge, and the race track is busy.  The betting is strong and the atmosphere is festive.  If the runners show the same quality as last week’s King George, it will be a fantastic day of racing."
