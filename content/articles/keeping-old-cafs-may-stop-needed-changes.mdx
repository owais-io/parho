title: "Keeping old cafés may stop needed changes"
summary: "Some residents want the cafés at Hampstead Heath to stay unchanged, but the council says longer leases are needed so operators can invest in better facilities and pay staff a living wage. The new bidding round had 30 offers, including family‑run Daisy Green, which will keep cafés open while upgrading the space. The City of London Corporation runs the park as a charity, funding upgrades with £12m and protecting the area for millions of visitors."
