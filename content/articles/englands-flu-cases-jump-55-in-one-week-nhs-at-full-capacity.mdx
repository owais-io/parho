title: "England’s Flu Cases Jump 55% in One Week, NHS at Full Capacity"
summary: "England’s hospitals are facing a huge flu surge: admissions rose 55% in one week to more than 2,600 patients a day, the highest for this season. NHS staff are stretched thin, and officials urge anyone eligible to get a flu jab before Christmas. A new mutated H3N2 strain is causing more severe illness, and while some pharmacies report local shortages, there’s no national shortage. The spike is putting extra pressure on A&E and ambulance services."
