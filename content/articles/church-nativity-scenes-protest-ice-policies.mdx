title: "Church Nativity Scenes Protest ICE Policies"
summary: "In several U.S. churches, nativity displays have been altered to criticize the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdown on migrants. Some scenes show Jesus, Mary, and Joseph tied or surrounded by gas masks and ICE‑marked soldiers, while others have removed the figures entirely and posted signs like “ICE was here.” These artistic protests highlight concerns about family separation and harsh immigration enforcement, reflecting a broader trend of faith leaders using holiday art to make political statements."
