title: "BBC Lord of the Flies: Why Diverse Casting Can Obscure the Book’s Original Message"
summary: "The BBC’s new version of William Golding’s classic book Lord of the Flies uses a mixed‑race cast. While that feels progressive, the writer argues it changes the original story’s meaning. The book’s power comes from a white‑English boy tribe facing “savages” that reflect colonial attitudes. By casting actors of colour, those colonial hints vanish, making the story feel less about racism and more like a simple “all‑people‑together” tale. Critics worry this blurs the book’s original anti‑colonial message."
