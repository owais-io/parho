title: "I thought Australia would stop Aboriginal deaths in custody, but it hasn't"
summary: "I was a young radio worker at a royal commission hearing about Aboriginal deaths in custody. I met Clarrie Nean, who died in hospital after a short time in police custody. Indigenous people are only 4% of the population but over a third of prisoners, and many die in custody each year. The article criticises government promises that don’t change the racist system and urges reforms such as better bail laws and de‑criminalising drunkenness."
