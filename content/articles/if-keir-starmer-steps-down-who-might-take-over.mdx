title: "If Keir Starmer steps down, who might take over?"
summary: "Keir Starmer’s poll scores are falling and Labour fears a big loss in local elections, so people are guessing who could replace him if he leaves. Angela Rayner, a popular deputy, is a strong contender, especially after her stamp‑duty scandal fades. Wes Streeting is also eyeing the role, with backing from MPs and party members. Other possible leaders include Shabana Mahmood, former leader Ed Miliband, defence secretary John Healey, and mayor Andy Burnham. The choice will shape Labour’s future."
