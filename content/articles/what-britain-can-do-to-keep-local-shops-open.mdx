title: "What Britain Can Do to Keep Local Shops Open"
summary: "The letter argues that Britain’s high streets are shrinking because people shop in big malls or online, and governments haven’t done enough to help. The writer says the only way to keep local shops alive is for shoppers to choose them and for councils to turn empty storefronts into housing or new businesses. Historic England has tried turning historic streets into attractions, and this could be copied elsewhere."
