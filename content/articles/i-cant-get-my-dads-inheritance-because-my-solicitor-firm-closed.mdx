title: "I can’t get my dad’s inheritance because my solicitor firm closed"
summary: "The writer’s dad died in July, and their solicitor firm, Samuel Phillips Law, stopped trading right after the probate was almost finished. The firm now holds all the paperwork and won’t answer calls. The writer is short‑changed, as a self‑employed person who couldn’t work during the funeral. New lawyers can complain to the regulator, but it might take months. The Solicitors Regulation Authority says the firm was shut down for suspected dishonesty, and another firm will now handle the files."
