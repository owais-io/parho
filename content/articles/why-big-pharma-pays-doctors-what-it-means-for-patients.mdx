title: "Why Big Pharma Pays Doctors – What It Means for Patients"
summary: "Big pharmaceutical companies give doctors money to promote their drugs, and this can influence which medicines patients get. In Australia, a study found that 4.9% of doctors received payments, with a median of $1,500 and total over AU$33 million. Research shows these payments often lead to more expensive prescriptions, raising ethical questions about patient care and public money, and it puts a strain on health budgets."
