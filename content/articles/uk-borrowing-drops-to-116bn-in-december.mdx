summary: "The UK government borrowed only £11.6bn in December, far below last year’s £18.7bn and the £13bn forecast. Stronger tax receipts helped cut spending costs, while interest on debt still took up most of the borrowing. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is pushing lower debt and has raised taxes to balance the budget. Analysts expect borrowing to keep falling as interest rates ease."
