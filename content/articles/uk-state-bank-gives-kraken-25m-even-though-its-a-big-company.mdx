title: "UK State Bank Gives Kraken £25m Even Though It’s a Big Company"
summary: "The UK Business Bank (BBB), normally backing small firms, has put £25m into Kraken Technologies, a huge software company worth £6.5bn that is part of Octopus Energy. The move raises questions because Kraken is not a start‑up and the BBB’s share is tiny. Critics say the public money may not be needed and that the BBB’s mission is being stretched. The investment is part of a new rule letting the BBB fund larger firms."
