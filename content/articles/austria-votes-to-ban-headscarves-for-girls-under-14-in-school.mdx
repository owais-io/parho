title: "Austria Votes to Ban Headscarves for Girls Under 14 in School"
summary: "Austria's parliament approved a new rule that stops girls under 14 from wearing headscarves at school. The law is meant to protect kids from the 'male gaze', but many say it unfairly targets Muslim families and could cause more division. The rule may be challenged in court, and parents could face fines up to €800 for repeat violations. The decision follows a 2019 ban that was overturned by the constitutional court."
