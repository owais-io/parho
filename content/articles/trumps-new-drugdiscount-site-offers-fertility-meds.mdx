title: "Trump’s New Drug‑Discount Site Offers Fertility Meds"
summary: "Trump’s new drug‑discount website, TrumpRx, has launched. It offers coupons for 43 medicines, including some used for IVF. The savings, up to about $2,200 per cycle, cover only a fraction of an IVF’s $30,000 price tag. Critics say the program barely meets the president’s pledge to make IVF affordable. The move also highlights tension with the Heritage Foundation, which opposes IVF on moral grounds."
