title: "US Energy Bills Keep Rising: What’s Behind It and How to Cut Costs"
summary: "US electricity and gas prices have climbed 6.7% and 10.8% in the last year, driven in part by Trump‑era policies that favor fossil‑fuel producers and cut programs that help low‑income households. The administration expanded LNG exports, froze cheap wind projects, kept coal plants running, and tried to slash energy‑efficiency credits. These moves raise system costs, push up prices and leave many families behind, with arrears hitting $23 billion."
