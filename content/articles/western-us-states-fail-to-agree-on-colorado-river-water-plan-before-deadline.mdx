title: "Western U.S. States Fail to Agree on Colorado River Water Plan Before Deadline"
summary: "Seven western states could not finish a new Colorado River water plan by the federal deadline, forcing the discussion into a more uncertain phase. The river feeds about 40 million people, farms, tribes, and even Mexico, but overuse and drought are draining it. A final plan is still needed by October 2026, but negotiations have stalled over how to cut water and who bears the losses. If states can’t agree, the federal government may step in, possibly leading to court battles and delays."
