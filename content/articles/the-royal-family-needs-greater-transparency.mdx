title: "The Royal Family Needs Greater Transparency"
summary: "Anna Whitelock writes that the Royal Family is too secretive, avoiding taxes, scrutiny, equality and accountability. The public will demand more openness by 2026. Recent scandals, like Andrew Epstein, show the problem and suggest Parliament should oversee the royals and set clear moral rules. Relying on royal goodwill is old‑fashioned; a constitutional change is needed to protect democracy and make the monarchy answerable. This change would restore public trust and keep the monarchy in line with modern democratic values."
