title: "MPs push for more free‑to‑air sports on UK TV"
summary: "Labour MPs are urging the UK government to broaden the list of sports that must be shown on free‑to‑air TV. Public‑service channels like the BBC and ITV want the Six Nations rugby, World Cup qualifiers and other big games added to the protected “crown jewels” list so fans can watch them without a pay‑channel. While the BBC and ITV have extended rights until 2029, they still need legal protection against subscription rivals."
