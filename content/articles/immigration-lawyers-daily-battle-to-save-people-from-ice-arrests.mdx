summary: "Immigration lawyer Milli Atkinson runs a free “Attorney of the Day” program in San Francisco’s chaotic court, helping over 30 000 people get quick legal advice before ICE can arrest them. She’s on call 24/7, mobilising volunteers whenever ICE detains someone. With judges fired, poor interpreter services and harsh holding‑cell conditions, the job is emotionally draining, but she sees wins from habeas‑corpus cases and community rallies that keep her going."
