title: "Labour’s Policy Flip‑Flops Undermine Confidence"
summary: "The Labour government has pulled back its plan to make digital IDs mandatory, a move that signals a broader trend of frequent policy reversals. The decision was originally aimed at stopping illegal workers from gaining jobs, but the new approach allows any ID for verification. Critics say these constant U‑turns erode public trust, hurt the Prime Minister’s authority, and show a lack of clear direction. While the cost‑of‑living remains a priority, the flip‑flops raise doubts about future leadership."
