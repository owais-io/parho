title: "Judge says former Yodel owner likely forged his mother’s signature"
summary: "The judge found that Jacob Corlett, who tried to retake control of Yodel, probably forged his mother’s signature. Corlett bought Yodel for £1, sold it again, and then claimed he had a document signed by his mother that would give him power. Forensic experts said the signatures were suspicious and likely fake. The court said Corlett acted selfishly, ignored debts, and hurt the company’s chances for help. Yodel’s new owners plan to pursue more legal action."
