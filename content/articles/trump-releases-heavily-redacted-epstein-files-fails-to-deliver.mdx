title: "Trump Releases Heavily Redacted Epstein Files, Fails to Deliver"
summary: "Trump promised to open up Jeffrey Epstein’s files, but the documents released last week were full of black‑out sections. The batch had few mentions of Trump or his alleged friendship with Epstein and left out many pages that Congress wants. The Justice Department said more records would come later, but the delay and the redactions made critics say it’s a cover‑up. Democrats called it illegal and warned Trump’s handling could hurt his support."
