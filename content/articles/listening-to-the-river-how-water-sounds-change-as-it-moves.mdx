title: "Listening to the River: How Water Sounds Change as It Moves"
summary: "After 30 years by East Anglia's quiet rivers, I’ve started learning to hear water. With friend Amy‑Jane Beer, we listen to a stream in a limestone gorge, picking up its burps, gurgles and splashes. The river talks when it hits rocks, branches or a weir, making a chorus of hisses, clanks and whistling. Focusing on these sounds turns the walk into a calm, mindful break in the cold winter days."
