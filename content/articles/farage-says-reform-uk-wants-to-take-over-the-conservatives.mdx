title: "Farage Says Reform UK Wants to Take Over the Conservatives"
summary: "Nigel Farage says Reform UK is looking to “reverse take over” the Conservative Party – meaning it wants to replace the Tories by winning former Tory MPs and supporters instead of signing a formal deal. He says a partnership would hurt Reform’s votes, and a merger only makes sense after an election. Donors and Tory figures are split, with Kemi Badenoch rejecting any tie‑up. Labour notes the parties are similar. Reform now has more than 21 former Tory MPs."
