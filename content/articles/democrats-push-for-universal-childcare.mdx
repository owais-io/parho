title: "Democrats Push for Universal Childcare"
summary: "Many Democrats running for office now want universal childcare. The push began with state‑level campaigns and grew after COVID‑19 showed how essential childcare is to the economy. Candidates in Wisconsin, Georgia, New York and others have added free or heavily subsidised care to their platforms. The party is moving away from old, income‑based help toward a system that would cover all families, like public schools."
