title: "Alton Towers Will Restrict Fast‑Track Passes for Some Guests During Half‑Term Trial"
summary: "During a February half‑term trial, Alton Towers (run by Merlin) will allow the fast‑lane disability passes only for guests who have trouble standing, need level access or urgent toilet help. Those who have difficulty with crowds will instead receive a free companion ticket and access to sensory rooms and quiet areas. Merlin says it will review the changes after the trial and that it keeps supporting neurodiverse guests."
