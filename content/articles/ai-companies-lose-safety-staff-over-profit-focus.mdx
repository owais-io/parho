title: "AI Companies Lose Safety Staff Over Profit Focus"
summary: "AI safety researchers have left big firms, saying profits trump safety. The move shows how OpenAI, Anthropic and others push profit at the cost of careful testing, even as they sell ads and add paid tools. The shift has raised concerns that users could be misled or harmed. A 2026 International AI Safety Report called for rules, but the US and UK won’t sign it, leaving regulation weak. The tech industry needs stronger oversight."
