title: "UK will search small‑boat arrivals for hidden phone sim cards"
summary: "New rules let immigration officers search for hidden phone sim cards on people arriving by small boats. The search can include pulling off jackets and even looking inside mouths, and can be applied to children. Officials say the aim is to catch smugglers by reading phone data. Refugee groups argue the move is invasive and disrespectful, and that many arrivals do not hide phones. A 2022 court ruling found the earlier blanket phone‑seizure policy unlawful."
