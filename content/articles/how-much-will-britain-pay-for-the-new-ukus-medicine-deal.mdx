title: "How Much Will Britain Pay for the New UK‑US Medicine Deal?"
summary: "UK and US agreed to a new medicine deal. The deal would let the UK pay more for branded drugs and might cost the NHS about £3 billion a year. That money could mean fewer scans, longer waits, or more deaths, experts say. The government says it will boost science and help patients, but critics argue it hurts the NHS and favours big pharma."
