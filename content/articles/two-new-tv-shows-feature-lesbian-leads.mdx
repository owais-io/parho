title: "Two New TV Shows Feature Lesbian Leads"
summary: "The author spent a holiday catching up on TV and discovered two new shows—*Pluribus* and *The Beast in Me*—that both star lesbian protagonists. She praises how the characters are strong, cranky, and fully fleshed out, breaking the usual stereotype that queer women on TV are soft or one‑dimensional. For her, seeing such bold lesbian leads is a small win for LGBTQ+ representation, and she hopes future shows keep this variety."
