title: "UK Regulators Must Fight Overpriced Bills That Hurt Consumers and the Economy"
summary: "The article argues that many UK services, like energy, mobile phone and insurance, have hidden fees and automatic price rises that keep customers overpaying. The authors say this happens because there isn’t enough competition and regulators aren’t powerful enough. They call for stricter rules, such as banning “RPI‑plus” price hikes, letting people cancel online contracts easily, and creating simple standard products. Labour’s cost‑of‑living pledges aren’t enough without these changes."
