title: "Billionaires Add $2.2 Trillion to Wealth in 2025"
summary: "The top 500 richest people around the world grew their fortunes by $2.2 trillion in 2025, taking their combined net worth to $11.9 trillion. One eighth of the gains came from just eight billionaires – like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison and Larry Page. Musk’s wealth jumped $190 billion to $622.7 billion, while Ellison added $57.7 billion. Australian miner Gina Rinehart’s holdings nearly tripled, but some, such as Philippine developer Manuel Villar, lost money. Oxfam said the added wealth could lift 3.8 billion people out of poverty, yet it highlights growing inequality."
