title: "California Bill Seeks to Keep ICE Officers Away From Polling Places"
summary: "California lawmakers want a new law that stops federal immigration officers (ICE) from standing within 200 feet of polling places, voting offices or ballot‑counting sites. The bill, introduced by Senators Umberg and Cervantes, says the move is to protect voters from intimidation, especially after former President Trump and others threatened to bring ICE to the polls. If passed, it would also allow counties to open early‑voting centers, add more drop boxes, and extend hours when ICE is nearby."
