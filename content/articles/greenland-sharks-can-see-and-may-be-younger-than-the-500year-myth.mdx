title: "Greenland Sharks Can See and May Be Younger Than the 500‑Year Myth"
summary: "Scientists discovered Greenland sharks can see and are probably younger than the old 500‑year myth. Their eyes are built to detect light, even if they look cloudy. The study also questions the age estimate, saying the dating method was uncertain. Sharks still hide many secrets, like where they breed and how climate change will affect them. These findings change how we think about these slow, deep‑water fish. We still don’t know where they give birth or how many pups they have."
