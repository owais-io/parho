title: "AI Bot Swarms Could Undermine Democracy"
summary: "Experts say that groups of AI‑powered bots that can act together—called “swarm bots”—could spread false information on social media and push people to support fake election outcomes. They warn that such swarms might be used by authoritarian leaders before the 2028 U.S. presidential election, and note that similar tactics were seen in 2024 elections in Taiwan, India and Indonesia. Scientists call for global tools to spot and stop these invisible armies, though some say the tech isn’t yet powerful enough."
