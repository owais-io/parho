title: "Justice Department Loses Case Seeking California Voter Data"
summary: "A federal judge ruled that the Justice Department cannot obtain California voters’ private details, calling the request a threat to democracy. The Trump‑era agency had asked for names, birth dates and SSN fragments to check for illegal voters, but the court dismissed the suit. The decision stops the federal government from centralising voter records and backs states’ right to run elections, a win for voting‑rights groups."
