title: "Fed Lowers Rates by a Quarter Point as Panel Divides Over Economy"
summary: "The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points for the third time this year, lowering them to 3.5‑3.75%. The decision was 9‑3, showing the Fed's board is split on how to handle the economy. Inflation and job numbers have edged up, while tariffs and a government shutdown have left data weak. President Trump has criticised the Fed and may pick a new chair after Powell’s term ends in May."
