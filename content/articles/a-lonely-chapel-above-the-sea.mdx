title: "A Lonely Chapel Above the Sea"
summary: "On St Catherine’s feast day I climbed the lone hill above the sea to a ruined chapel that still feels alive. The stone walls are weather‑worn, the windows boarded, and inside only pale stone and sunlit shadows. The wind howls like crashing waves, and an old wishing recess lets girls once kneel and pray for a husband. The chapel, built by monks in the 1300s, sits among ancient barrows and circles that remind me of an iron‑age girl buried nearby."
