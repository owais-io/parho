title: "Slovenia Labels Roma Neighbourhoods as Security Threats"
summary: "Slovenia has passed a new law that lets police raid and watch homes in areas called “security zones.” The law came after a police officer was killed near a Roma neighbourhood. While the government says it’s about crime, critics say it unfairly targets Roma people. The bill lets police enter houses without a court order and use drones or cameras. More than 60% of people surveyed support it, but the law could hurt Roma rights and affect upcoming elections."
