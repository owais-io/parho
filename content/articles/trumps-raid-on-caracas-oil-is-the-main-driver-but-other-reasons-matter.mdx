title: "Trump’s raid on Caracas: Oil is the main driver, but other reasons matter"
summary: "Trump’s raid on Caracas was mainly about Venezuela’s oil. The US liked the idea of owning Venezuela’s big oil deposits, but oil alone didn’t explain why the attack happened. Other reasons were small US profits, a drop in oil prices, and political pressure on China and Cuba, plus Trump’s own politics in Florida. Venezuela’s long history of oil wealth, coups, and economic collapse also mattered. Taking out Maduro won’t change the country’s deep problems."
