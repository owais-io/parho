title: "US Aid Cuts Give Anti‑Rights Groups a Chance to Expand Their Agenda"
summary: "In January 2025 the U.S. stopped funding USAID, shutting down clinics and cutting 83 % of programs. This vacuum is being filled by anti‑rights groups that push the Geneva Consensus Declaration, a pro‑life agenda that blocks abortion and limits family planning. They’re building “Protego” projects that promote abstinence and replace comprehensive sexual education. New U.S. aid deals likely carry the global gag rule, threatening NGOs in countries like Kenya and risking higher rates of unsafe abortions."
