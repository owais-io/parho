title: "Inflation rises, but gas companies still profit"
summary: "Australia’s inflation rose to 3.8% in October, the first monthly report since 2024. Prices went up mainly because gas, used to generate electricity, has been expensive after Russia’s war cut supplies. The government tried to help by giving electricity rebates, but the cuts are coming back, so prices are climbing again. While gas companies are still making huge profits, households and the government feel the higher bills."
