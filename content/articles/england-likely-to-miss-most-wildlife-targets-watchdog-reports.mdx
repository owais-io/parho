title: "England Likely to Miss Most Wildlife Targets, Watchdog Reports"
summary: "A watchdog says England is on track to miss most wildlife and environmental targets set for 2030. The OEP report found 7 of 10 goals unlikely to be achieved, including protecting species like hedgehogs and red squirrels. New laws could allow building on protected land, while flooding and wildfire risks rise. Some progress has been made on air quality and climate action, but the government still has to step up to meet its own promises."
