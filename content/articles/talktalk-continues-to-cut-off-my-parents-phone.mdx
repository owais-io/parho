title: "TalkTalk Continues to Cut Off My Parents' Phone"
summary: "My 84‑year‑old parents lost their TalkTalk landline in August. TalkTalk promised to keep their number but then cancelled the new contract and told my dad to sign another one. The line kept cutting off, and TalkTalk offered £100, £150, then £200 in apologies while swapping contracts. They even charged my parents £75 for calls made while the line was down. The service is working again, but the family is tired of the confusion and extra costs."
