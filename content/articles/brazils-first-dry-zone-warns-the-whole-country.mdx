title: "Brazil’s First Dry Zone Warns the Whole Country"
summary: "Brazil's new dry zone in the northeast shows how climate change hurts small farmers. In Macururé, goat owner Raildon Suplício Maia can no longer grow crops or feed goats because rain is scarce and the land has turned arid. Scientists say a 5,700‑sq‑km area is now classified as arid, the first in the country. Residents rely on water tanks and trench systems, but shortages keep growing. Local leaders call for stronger policies to stop desertification and help communities adapt."
