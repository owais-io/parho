title: "**Supreme Court says the President can’t fire a federal judge**"
summary: "The U.S. Supreme Court has decided that a President does not have the power to simply fire a federal judge.   The case was about President Trump trying to remove U.S. District Judge J. Anthony Williams. - Judge Williams was appointed in 2017 by President Obama.   - He had been hearing a lawsuit that challenged the 2020 election results.   - Trump wanted to replace him, but the judge said he would not step down.   - The court said a judge can only be removed by impeachment, not by the President alone.   So the ruling protects the independence of the federal courts. The judge will keep hearing cases, and the President can’t change that."
