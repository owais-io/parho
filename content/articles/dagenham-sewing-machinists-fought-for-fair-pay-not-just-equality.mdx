title: "Dagenham sewing machinists fought for fair pay, not just equality"
summary: "In 1968, 187 sewing machinists at Ford's Dagenham plant stopped work to protest a new grading system that put them at level B, which they felt undervalued their semi‑skilled work. Negotiated by Barbara Castle, they returned after an offer that would raise their wages from 85% to 100% of the male rate over two years. In 1984, a second strike finally earned them official grade C status and full pay equality."
