title: "Eight skiers die in California avalanche as climate‑driven storms hit Sierra Nevada"
summary: "An avalanche in California's Sierra Nevada killed eight skiers. Hot months earlier left very thin snow, then a heavy storm added wet, dense snow that didn’t stick to the old layer, making a big slide. Climate change is increasing these risky patterns. Forecasters gave a level‑four warning, the highest, and urged people to stay off the slopes. Even rescue teams struggled to reach the victims."
