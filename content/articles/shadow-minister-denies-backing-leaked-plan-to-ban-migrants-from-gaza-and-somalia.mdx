title: "Shadow minister denies backing leaked plan to ban migrants from Gaza and Somalia"
summary: "A leaked Australian Liberal Party plan would ban people from 13 regions, including Gaza and Somalia, because those areas are linked to terrorist groups. Sussan Ley, who was the shadow immigration minister until the party’s leadership changed, says she never agreed to the policy and is worried about it. The plan could cut up to 100,000 asylum seekers and students, limit appeals, and add tough social‑media checks. New opposition leader Angus Taylor wants to strengthen the rules."
