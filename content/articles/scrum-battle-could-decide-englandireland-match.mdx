title: "Scrum Battle Could Decide England‑Ireland Match"
summary: "England and Ireland are set to face off in a match where the scrum could be the deciding factor. England’s front‑row players, led by Joe Heyes, want to improve after recent scrums that were shaky. Ireland has a history of losing points when the scrum goes wrong, so they’re tightening up. The game also has a personal twist for Heyes, whose Irish relatives will watch from the stands."
