title: "Regulator Lets 7 am Manchester‑London Train Carry Passengers After Public Outcry"
summary: "The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) decided the 7 am train from Manchester to London will run as a full passenger service after people and ministers protested its earlier “ghost train” ruling. The fast train, which takes under two hours, had been set to operate empty for scheduling reasons, but the backlash and pressure from the rail minister and transport secretary made the ORR reverse its decision. The train remains popular with business travelers and people who rely on quick, reliable travel to London."
