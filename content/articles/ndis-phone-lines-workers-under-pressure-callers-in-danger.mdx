title: "NDIS phone lines: workers under pressure, callers in danger"
summary: "NDIS phone lines are run by private company Serco, and workers are under heavy pressure to answer urgent calls from people in crisis. They receive only a few weeks of training, low pay and are expected to meet high volume targets. The stress causes mental‑health problems, and staff report that they often fail to act on immediate danger. The government claims good service, but staff say the system is a pressure‑cooker that puts clients at risk."
