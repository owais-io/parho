title: "Farage’s attack on Turkish barbers is racist, minister says"
summary: "A government minister said Nigel Farage’s comments about Turkish barber shops are racist and part of a strategy that blames minority businesses instead of fixing high street problems. The minister warned Reform UK is using “politics of division” while it offers no clear plans to revive struggling town centres. She praised Labour’s £5bn regeneration programme and said the party needs real solutions for the long‑term decline of local shops."
