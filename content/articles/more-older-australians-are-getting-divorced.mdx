title: "More Older Australians Are Getting Divorced"
summary: "In Australia, divorces among people over 50 are rising, a trend called “grey divorce.” While overall divorce rates are falling, older couples split more often because of empty‑nest stress, finances and a shift in what they want from a relationship. Many in their 50s and beyond are looking for companionship without cohabiting or sharing money, and dating apps have changed how they meet. The story shows that love is changing and no longer tied to youth."
