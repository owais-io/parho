title: "Germany’s forests are dying, new planting plans might help"
summary: "Germany’s forests have been devastated by bark beetles and drought, killing millions of spruce trees. The usual practice of planting single‑species stands is now seen as risky. Foresters are testing mixed‑species plots—beech, fir, sycamore—to build more resilient forests. Biodiversity can help trees survive pests and heat. Scientists warn that the loss of forest carbon sinks threatens EU climate goals. The new planting strategy hopes to restore trees and keep Germany on track."
