title: "Tax‑office call‑centre worker seeks equal pay with direct employees"
summary: "Nathan Brunne works for a private firm that runs ATO call‑centres. Although he does the same job as ATO staff, he earns far less and has fewer benefits, like paid holidays. He’s filed a “same job, same pay” case with the Fair Work Commission, hoping to level wages and conditions. The outcome could change how the government outsources tax work and affect thousands of workers."
