title: "Israel lets private traders bring restricted items into Gaza that aid groups can't"
summary: "Israel uses a separate system that lets private traders send items into Gaza that humanitarian groups are barred from bringing, such as generators and metal tent poles. The government says these “dual‑use” goods could help Hamas, but critics say the rule only boosts traders’ profits and hurts aid delivery. Humanitarian workers, the U.S. military, and the EU say the two‑tier system blocks essential supplies, raising costs and limiting help for people in need."
