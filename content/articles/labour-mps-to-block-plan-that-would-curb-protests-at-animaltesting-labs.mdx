title: "Labour MPs to block plan that would curb protests at animal‑testing labs"
summary: "Labour MPs are set to vote against a government move that would label animal‑testing sites as “key national infrastructure.” The change would give police stronger powers to stop protests, even peaceful ones, and could lead to fines or up to a year in jail. MPs and animal‑rights groups say the move is an unnecessary crackdown on civil liberties. The government argues it protects vaccine production and supply chains."
