summary: "Jaxson Dart says the NFL isn’t soccer, but his own style is getting him hurt a lot. In his first eight starts, he’s taken as many unnecessary hits as any rookie quarterback. The Giants worry that his “run‑and‑hit” play could end his career and hurt the team’s future. With coaching changes and concussion rules, the club wants him to stay on the field, but keep his head out of danger."
