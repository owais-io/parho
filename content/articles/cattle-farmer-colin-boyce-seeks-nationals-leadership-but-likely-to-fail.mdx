title: "Cattle farmer Colin Boyce seeks Nationals leadership, but likely to fail"
summary: "Colin Boyce, a 62‑year‑old Queensland cattle farmer turned MP, has announced he wants to become leader of the Nationals. He’s known for crossing party lines on mining and climate bills, and for being a vocal climate‑science denier. Boyce’s bid comes after a split in the Coalition and a recent leadership spill. Most party members doubt he has enough support, and many see him as a fringe candidate who will likely fail."
