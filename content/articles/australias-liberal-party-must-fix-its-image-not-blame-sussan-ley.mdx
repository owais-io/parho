title: "Australia’s Liberal Party must fix its image, not blame Sussan Ley"
summary: "Australia’s Liberal Party has blamed Sussan Ley for its problems, but the real issue is a loss of voter trust. New leader Angus Taylor must rebuild the party’s image by showing real economic management and addressing housing affordability. Voters want values that match their lives, not just “not‑Labor” slogans. The party needs a big‑tent, values‑based message that welcomes diverse views to win back voters."
