title: "UK visa changes add more hurdles for migrant workers"
summary: "One skilled‑worker migrant and his British‑married wife warn that the Labour government’s new “earned settlement” plan will make it tougher and more expensive for visa holders to become permanent residents. It adds extra paperwork, pushes the deadline back by up to five years, and imposes earnings tests many caregivers can’t meet. The author urges UK citizens to support visa holders in the consultation, reminding us that migrants help teach, care, and work in our country, not serve as political tools."
