title: "Smaller farms will get nature money first, minister announces"
summary: "England’s environment minister will say that nature money will go first to small farms. In June only smaller farms and newcomers can apply for the new Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI). Bigger farms will have to wait until September. The SFI replaced EU payments and gives money to farmers who protect soil, wildlife and the countryside. The change aims to help the less‑profitable farms and give clear rules after last year’s confusing closures."
