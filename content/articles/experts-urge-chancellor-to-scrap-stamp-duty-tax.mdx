title: "Experts urge Chancellor to scrap stamp duty tax"
summary: "Property experts, including TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, are telling Chancellor Rachel Reeves to drop the stamp duty tax, which they call a “sin tax.” They argue it unfairly penalises buyers who want more expensive homes and hurts first‑time buyers and the rental market. The Treasury is already thinking about a new tax on homes over £500,000 and a “mansion tax.” Experts say a single annual property tax would be fairer and keep house prices stable."
