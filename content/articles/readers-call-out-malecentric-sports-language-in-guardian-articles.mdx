title: "Readers call out male‑centric sports language in Guardian articles"
summary: "Several readers wrote in to say that Guardian articles often use male‑centric sports language that many women find confusing. One letter mentioned cricket bowler Stuart Broad as an example of a name women don’t know. The writer calls for less “blokey” pub‑style talk and language that speaks to the Guardian’s female audience. Other letters touch on football chants, religious language, and fitness advice."
