title: "Big rimu berry harvest could spark a breeding boom for New Zealand’s endangered kākāpō"
summary: "A huge crop of rimu berries is expected this year, which may trigger the rare breeding season of New Zealand’s only flightless, nocturnal parrot, the kākāpō. Conservationists hope the abundant fruit will give the 236 birds a chance to lay more eggs, possibly producing more chicks. The species, once near extinction, now breeds every 2‑4 years when rimu trees “mast.” With a growing population, scientists are already thinking about where to keep the birds."
