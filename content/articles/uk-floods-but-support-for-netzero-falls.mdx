title: "UK floods but support for net‑zero falls"
summary: "Britain has been soaked for months, yet fewer people want the government to hit net‑zero emissions by 2050. A recent poll shows only 29% back the target, down from 54% in 2021. Rising costs, energy bills, and political push‑back on green rules are blamed for the drop. Still, 64% think the net‑zero pledge should stay, but the sense of urgency is fading."
