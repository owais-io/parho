title: "UK Hospitals Face Crisis as Overseas Nurses Decline"
summary: "In the UK, hospitals and care homes are worried because far fewer overseas nurses and carers are coming in. Researchers found that visas for overseas nurses fell 93% in three years, and care‑worker visas dropped 97% in two years. With 25,000 nursing vacancies still open, the shortage could hurt patient care. Experts say the government must change its tight migration rules and boost domestic training."
