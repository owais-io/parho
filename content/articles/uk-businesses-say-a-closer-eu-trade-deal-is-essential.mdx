title: "UK businesses say a closer EU trade deal is essential"
summary: "Business groups say 54% of UK exporters struggle under the current EU deal, urging Labour to speed up talks for better trade. The British Chambers of Commerce surveyed almost 1,000 SMEs and found the 2021 trade agreement isn’t boosting sales. Only a few firms feel the government helps with trade rules. The BCC wants fewer border checks, cleaner VAT rules, and more EU cooperation. Labour leaders, including Wes Streeting, are looking at deeper ties, a customs union, despite their manifesto promise."
