title: "Reuse and return programs could almost eliminate plastic waste in 15 years"
summary: "A new study says that if we start more reuse and return schemes—like deposit return boxes for groceries and refillable cups for drinks—we could cut plastic pollution from packaging by 97% by 2040. The report warns that plastic waste is rising fast and could double in the next 15 years, harming people, animals and the planet. Switching to materials like cardboard or glass and banning some plastics could also help, saving billions in waste costs."
