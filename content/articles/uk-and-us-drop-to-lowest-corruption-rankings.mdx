title: "UK and US Drop to Lowest Corruption Rankings"
summary: "Transparency International’s corruption index has pushed both the UK and the US into the bottom tier of the world list. The UK slipped from 7th to 20th, mainly because of huge political donations and scandals around its parties, while the US fell to 29th after Trump‑era events and attacks on journalists. The report warns that such back‑sliding erodes public trust and urges governments to clean up money in politics."
