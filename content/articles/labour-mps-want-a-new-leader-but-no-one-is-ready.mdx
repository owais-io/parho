title: "Labour MPs want a new leader but no one is ready"
summary: "Labour MPs are frustrated after a heated debate over Peter Mandelson documents. They want someone brave enough to challenge Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but no one has stepped forward. Angela Rayner defended the government, though she’s still under a tax investigation, and Wes Streeting was absent at the key moment. Left‑wing MPs called for a leadership change. Conservatives delayed the debate, giving Starmer a reprieve."
