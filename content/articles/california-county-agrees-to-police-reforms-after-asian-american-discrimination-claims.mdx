title: "California County Agrees to Police Reforms After Asian American Discrimination Claims"
summary: "A northern California county, Siskiyou, has agreed to change its policing after lawsuits say Asian Americans, especially the Hmong community, were stopped and searched unfairly. Data showed 2.4% of adults are Asian, yet 28% of traffic stops involved Asian drivers. The county will stop race‑based stops, require body‑cam use and interpreters, and set up independent oversight. The deal still leaves water‑access claims to be fought in court."
