title: "Easy Coquilles Saint‑Jacques Recipe"
summary: "This simple recipe turns scallops into a fancy starter. First clean the scallops and sweat finely chopped shallots in butter. Poach the scallops in a splash of wine, then reduce the wine into a syrup and stir in cream. While that’s cooking, make a quick topping of garlic‑butter, parsley and breadcrumbs. Spoon the sauce over the scallops in shells, sprinkle the breadcrumbs, and grill until golden. It’s quick, tasty, and budget‑friendly if you use frozen scallops."
