title: "A Doctor’s Sleep Trick Backed Us Up All Night"
summary: "A doctor suggested a sleep trick called cognitive shuffling, which helps quiet a racing mind after waking. It involves picking a simple word, then thinking of unrelated items that start with each letter, so your brain can relax. My wife and I tried it after a 3 a.m. wake‑up, but our debate over good words kept us wide awake instead. The hack still works for many."
