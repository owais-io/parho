title: "UK to Test If Cutting Social Media Helps Children"
summary: "Researchers in the UK will test whether limiting social‑media time helps children. About 4,000 kids in 30 schools in Bradford will be split into two groups. One group will just track their app use; the other will get a one‑hour daily limit plus a 9‑pm‑to‑7‑am curfew. After six weeks kids will fill out surveys on anxiety, depression, sleep and bullying. Results are expected in summer 2027, while lawmakers debate a full ban."
