title: "Florida Bill Lets Parents Opt Out of Child Vaccines"
summary: "Florida Republicans passed a bill that would make it easier for parents to refuse vaccines for their school‑age kids. The new law would add a “conscience” exemption to the existing religious one, letting parents say they don't want certain shots. It keeps mandatory vaccines like measles, MMR, diphtheria, tetanus and polio in place, but weakens overall protections. Some lawmakers and health experts warn the bill could lower vaccination rates and harm public health."
