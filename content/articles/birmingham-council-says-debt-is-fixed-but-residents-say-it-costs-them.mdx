summary: "Birmingham city council announced it was no longer in debt after selling assets and raising tax, but many locals say the cuts have hurt services. Adult day centres, libraries and youth clubs have closed, and a bin‑strike has left residents without waste pickup. Residents worry that selling community assets for short‑term cash will make things worse in the long run. The council says it still plans to keep libraries open and will invest money back into services."
