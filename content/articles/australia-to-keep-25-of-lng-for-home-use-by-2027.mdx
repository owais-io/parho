title: "Australia to Keep 25% of LNG for Home Use by 2027"
summary: "The government will require the three biggest LNG exporters to set aside 15‑25 % of their gas for Australian customers, aiming to lower east‑coast prices. The rule starts in 2027 but applies to any contracts signed before then. While unions and environmental groups welcome the move, industry says more new supply will be needed, and some worry the policy may not fully fix shortages as electricity use rises."
