title: "Ski Jumpers Accused of Injecting Penises to Gain Suit Advantage"
summary: "Ski jumpers are accused of injecting hyaluronic acid into their penises to make the measurements taken for their suits larger. The German paper Bild reported the story, and the World Anti‑Doping Agency is looking into it. A bigger measured size could let the athlete wear a slightly larger suit, giving a tiny lift advantage. But the injections carry serious risks, including pain, infection, and even gangrene."
