title: "Scotland Makes Swift‑Bricks Mandatory for All New Buildings to Protect Birds"
summary: "Scotland’s parliament has made it legal to use special “swift‑bricks” on every new building. The bricks give cavity‑nesting birds, especially swifts, a place to live. The move follows a four‑year push in England and shows the Scottish government’s commitment to wildlife. While the law only requires the bricks where practical, it could set a model for the rest of the UK. The decision aims to reverse a 60 % decline in swifts since 1995."
