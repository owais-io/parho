summary: "Manchester City’s new £65m winger, Antoine Semenyo, is allowed to play in the Cup semi‑final thanks to a recent rule change that lets players who joined before the first leg take part. But the team’s other January signing, Marc Guéhi, is ruled ineligible for the final because he joined after the first leg had begun. Manager Pep Guardiola is upset and may try to force the club to play him anyway, risking a complaint."
