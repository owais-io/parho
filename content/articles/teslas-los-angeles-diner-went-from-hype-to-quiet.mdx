title: "Tesla’s Los Angeles Diner Went From Hype to Quiet"
summary: "Tesla opened a retro‑style diner in LA in July 2025. At first, crowds of fans and curious visitors filled the place. But protests, noise complaints, food that ran out or was soggy, and the chef’s departure turned the buzz into a ghost town. Now only a handful of diners show up, and the shop is mostly clean with very few customers. Tesla has not announced plans to open more diners."
