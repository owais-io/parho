summary: "Back in the 1970s, Britain and Iceland fought over who could fish for cod in the North Atlantic. Both were NATO members, but the disagreement escalated into a full‑blown “cod war.” The U.S., concerned about NATO unity, urged Britain to back down, and Britain finally agreed to limit its fishing in Icelandic waters. The dispute showed how big powers can influence smaller ones to keep allies in line."
