title: "Trinity Hall’s new admissions plan draws fire from former students"
summary: "Alumni of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, are upset over the college’s new strategy to recruit more students from elite private schools. They argue that this move rewards privilege, not potential, and could hurt state‑school applicants who deserve a chance at Cambridge. Former students, including a recent graduate and a teacher, warn the college risks becoming a “finishing school for the rich.” They call on Trinity Hall to keep its inclusive, merit‑based admissions."
