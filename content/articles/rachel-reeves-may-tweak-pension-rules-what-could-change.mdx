title: "Rachel Reeves may tweak pension rules – what could change?"
summary: "Rumours are swirling that the new budget might change pensions, but experts say cutting the tax‑free cash you can take from a pension is probably off the table. The chancellor may limit “salary sacrifice” schemes, capping how much pay can be swapped into a pension for free National Insurance. That could save the government up to £2bn but would lower workers’ take‑home pay. Pension tax relief and the tax‑free lump‑sum limit are likely to stay the same."
