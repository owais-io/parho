title: "Trump Plans Lawsuit Against BBC Over Edited Speech"
summary: "Trump says the BBC edited his speech to make it look like he urged violence, and he plans to sue. The key issue is whether the BBC acted with malice, which Trump must prove. He cites a leaked memo and claims Florida viewers accessed the clip via VPN. The BBC argues the edit was a brief cut, not malicious, and only aired in the UK. Trump says the edit damaged his reputation and business, but the BBC disputes that."
