Hundreds of soldiers and civilians from 29 countries worked through scenarios that shut off power, jammed satellites, flooded systems with malware and spread fake news. The exercise showed the stress of fighting cyberwar, and NATO is looking to be more proactive, even testing an AI chatbot to help commanders make decisions quickly."
