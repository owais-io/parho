title: "Thomas Frank Faces the Same Pitfalls as Nuno at Spurs"
summary: "After Nuno Espírito Santo was fired from Spurs after a short, poor run, Thomas Frank is under similar pressure. Both men came from successful English clubs, signed long‑term deals, but struggled with unhappy fans, weak attack and a defensive style. Frank has now improved the back‑line and added new signings, but fans still want faster, more exciting play. The board backs him, and he hopes to keep the club from falling into relegation trouble."
