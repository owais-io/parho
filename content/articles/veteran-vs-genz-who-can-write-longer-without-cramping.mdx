title: "Veteran vs. Gen‑Z: Who Can Write Longer Without Cramping?"
summary: "Guardian’s Zoe Williams and trainee George Francis Lee faced off in a 10‑minute pen‑and‑paper test. The challenge came as Ofqual considers letting students take GCSEs and A‑levels on laptops because many feel hand fatigue. Williams, a seasoned writer, kept steady but was not faster than Lee. Both ended up exhausted, with no clear winner, but the experiment highlighted how writing skills can vary across generations."
