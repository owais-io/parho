title: "Scientists say human emissions made 2025 the third‑hottest year on record"
summary: "Scientists say 2025 was the third‑hottest year ever, mainly because of pollution from burning fossil fuels. Global temperatures were about 1.5 °C higher than before the industrial age. The Paris climate goal of staying below 1.5 °C is likely to be broken by the end of the decade, experts warn. The year saw record‑hot January, melting polar ice, and more heat days on half the planet’s land."
