title: "Keir Starmer, Britain’s first musical prime minister in 50 years, must champion the arts"
summary: "Martin Kettle argues that Britain’s arts are in danger because funding is low, the media ignore them, and many feel the arts are for the elite. He says the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, who studied music, should use his experience to help. A report by Margaret Hodge shows the country spends less on culture than most of Europe. Kettle urges Starmer to act, improve funding, and make the arts accessible to everyone."
