title: "Mets star Pete Alonso signs $155 million deal with Orioles"
summary: "Pete Alonso, the Mets’ all‑time home‑run king, has agreed to a five‑year, $155 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He left the Mets after opting out of a short‑term deal and the team had already given long‑term contracts to Juan Soto and Francisco Lindor. Alonso hit 38 homers and 126 RBIs last season, but concerns about his defense and base‑running led the Mets to pass. The Orioles hope his power will help lift their struggling lineup."
