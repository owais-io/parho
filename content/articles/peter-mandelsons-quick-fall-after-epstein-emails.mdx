title: "Peter Mandelson’s Quick Fall After Epstein Emails"
summary: "Peter Mandelson, once the UK’s ambassador to the US, lost his job and faces arrest after emails linking him to Jeffrey Epstein were released. The messages show he was friends with Epstein, even stayed at his townhouse, and may have shared confidential government information. The fallout forced the prime minister to sack him, made his chief of staff resign, and led to calls for him to give evidence to Congress. Now he’s arrested on a misconduct in public office charge."
