title: "Peter Thiel Donates $3 Million to Stop California’s Billionaire Tax"
summary: "Peter Thiel gave $3 million to a California lobbying group that opposes a proposed billionaire tax. The tax would hit anyone worth more than $1 billion with a one‑time 5% levy. Thiel, worth $26 billion, could owe about $1.3 billion under the measure. Other tech giants like Larry Page and Sergey Brin have moved money out of California, and some, like Nvidia’s CEO, support the tax. The law is still gathering signatures."
