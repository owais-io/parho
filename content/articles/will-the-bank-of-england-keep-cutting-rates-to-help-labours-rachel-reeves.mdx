title: "Will the Bank of England keep cutting rates to help Labour's Rachel Reeves?"
summary: "Since the election, the Bank of England has cut interest rates five times, and a sixth cut is expected this week. Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves will use the lower rates to support her budget, which includes cuts to energy bills and fuel duty. The cuts help businesses and borrowers but the economy remains weak. Economists worry the cuts may only give temporary relief, and future decisions are still unclear."
