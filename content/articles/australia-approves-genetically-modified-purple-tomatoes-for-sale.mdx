title: "Australia approves genetically modified purple tomatoes for sale"
summary: "Australia has cleared the first genetically engineered fresh food for sale – purple tomatoes called Purple Bliss. The tomatoes get their colour from snapdragon genes that produce anthocyanin pigments, like those in blueberries. They’re sweeter, juicier and can be sold whole or made into sauces, but must carry a GM label. The release was deemed low risk, though some groups opposed it, saying more studies are needed."
