title: "Scientists Say Neanderthals Kissing Modern Humans Is Likely"
summary: "Researchers found evidence that kissing is an ancient behavior shared by many primates, not just humans. By defining a kiss as friendly mouth‑to‑mouth contact without food, they traced its origins back about 20 million years. The study suggests Neanderthals probably kissed and may have even shared kisses with modern humans, which fits with genetic evidence of interbreeding and shared mouth bacteria. Kissing might have helped bonding and mating in early hominids."
