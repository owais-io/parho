title: "Car exhaust placement matters for the pollution people breathe"
summary: "Researchers measured exhaust from 38,000 cars in Milan and York. Diesel vehicles still produce the most air pollution, especially near the curb. They found that cars with exhausts on the left side (closest to the sidewalk) let pedestrians inhale about 40% more pollution than cars whose exhausts are in the middle of the lane. If all diesel cars moved their exhausts to the centre, pollution on the curb could drop 21%."
