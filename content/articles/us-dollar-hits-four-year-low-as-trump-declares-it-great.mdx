title: "US Dollar Hits Four-Year Low as Trump Declares It 'Great'"
summary: "The US dollar fell about 1.5 % in two days, hitting its lowest level since February 2022, after President Trump said the weaker currency was fine. Investors rushed to safe assets such as gold and the Swiss franc, which rose to multi‑year highs, and the euro also jumped. A weaker dollar helps U.S. exporters but raises import costs and may spur inflation. The Fed will announce its first rate decision next week, adding uncertainty."
