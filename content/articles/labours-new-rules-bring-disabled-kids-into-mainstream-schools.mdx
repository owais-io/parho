title: "Labour’s new rules bring disabled kids into mainstream schools"
summary: "Labour’s new rules aim to put 60,000 more disabled students into ordinary schools by 2030, giving each school extra money and teaching assistants. The changes follow years when fewer disabled kids attended mainstream classes and support staff were cut. Critics worry costs will rise, especially as private schools charge high fees and local councils must pay for transport. Supporters say inclusion benefits everyone, helping disabled pupils reach their goals and normalising diversity in everyday life."
