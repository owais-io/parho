title: "Federal agencies are copying Trump’s aggressive social‑media style"
summary: "US federal agencies, such as DHS and ICE, now use memes, jokes, and sharp insults on social media just like Trump did. They post polarising content—like a Santa‑hatmed DHS meme or “HO HO HOME” slogans—that often spreads false or exaggerated claims about immigrants. Experts say this approach inflames debate, dehumanises people, and works well with algorithms, creating a propaganda‑like effect that erodes public trust."
