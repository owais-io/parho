title: "Nobel‑Winner Builds Portable Machine to Make Water from Air in Disaster Zones"
summary: "Chemist Prof Omar Yaghi, who won a 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, has created a low‑cost, container‑sized device that pulls moisture out of the air and turns it into clean drinking water. The machine runs on waste heat and can produce up to 1,000 litres a day, even when the power grid is down after hurricanes or droughts. Yaghi says the tech could help Caribbean islands, like Grenada, recover from storms by giving communities water when supplies fail."
