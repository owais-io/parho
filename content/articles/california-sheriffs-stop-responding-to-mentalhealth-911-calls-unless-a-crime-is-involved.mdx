title: "California Sheriffs Stop Responding to Mental‑Health 911 Calls Unless a Crime Is Involved"
summary: "Some California sheriff’s offices now ignore 911 calls that are just mental‑health crises and involve no crime. The move, led by Sacramento and El Cajon, follows evidence that police responses can end badly—over 2,000 people nationwide were killed in such calls, 274 in California. Instead, dispatchers will direct callers to crisis hotlines like 988 or send mental‑health teams. While the goal is safer outcomes, many communities still lack enough trained responders."
