title: "UK Cuts Threaten Future Scientists"
summary: "UK is slashing physics research funding, cutting grants by almost a third and canceling major projects worth £250m. Early‑career scientists say the cuts will force them abroad, losing a generation of talent. UKRI says it will focus on applied science to stay competitive, but senior researchers warn morale is low and the country could miss out on breakthroughs. The government is under pressure to step in."
