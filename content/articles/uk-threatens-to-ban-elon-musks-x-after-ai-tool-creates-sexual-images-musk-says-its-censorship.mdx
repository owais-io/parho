summary: "The UK government said it could fine or even ban X because its AI tool, Grok, was used to make sexual pictures of women and children without permission. Elon Musk responded that this is an attempt to silence free speech. Ministers said they’d ask Ofcom to block X if it didn’t remove the harmful feature. The platform has now limited the feature to paid users only, but the issue remains a hot topic."
