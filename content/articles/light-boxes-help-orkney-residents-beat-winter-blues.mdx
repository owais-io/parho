title: "Light Boxes Help Orkney Residents Beat Winter Blues"
summary: "In Orkney, Scotland, libraries are lending special “Wintering Well” light boxes to people who feel sad in the short, dark winter days. Each kit has a bright lamp, a guide to indoor and outdoor activities, and a sky‑frame that shows how much light you can catch. Residents say the boxes lift their mood and encourage them to walk in daylight. The project, part of a UK research study, hopes to bring light boxes to libraries across the country."
