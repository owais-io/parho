title: "Wild beavers could be living farther than we know"
summary: "A farmer in Berkshire says he saw a beaver on his garden camera twice, a few weeks apart, which shows the animal is probably living there for good. The Beaver Trust lists beavers in several counties, but this new evidence puts Berkshire on the map. Even though there are captive beavers nearby, they haven’t escaped. The findings suggest wild beavers might be more common than people think."
