title: "Food Delivery Riders Face Low Pay, Harassment and Hard Working Conditions"
summary: "Many food‑delivery riders in the UK are migrants who earn less than the minimum wage, work long hours on bikes or mopeds, and face danger and abuse from customers. They often work legally but feel invisible and vulnerable, with no bosses to talk to—only the app. While companies say they support riders, unions say the pay and safety are still too low. The workers keep working to survive and support their families."
