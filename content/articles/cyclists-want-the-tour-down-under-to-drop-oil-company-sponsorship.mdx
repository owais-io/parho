title: "Cyclists Want the Tour Down Under to Drop Oil Company Sponsorship"
summary: "The Tour Down Under in South Australia is sponsored by oil company Santos. Cyclists, like Olympic rider Maeve Plouffe, say extreme heat from climate change makes racing tough and that a fossil‑fuel sponsor feels wrong. They want a new sponsor that aligns with modern values and protects the planet. Organisers say Santos’ money has helped grow the race, but the exact sponsorship amount and government contribution are unclear. Some think a renewable‑energy partner could replace Santos."
