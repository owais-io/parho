title: "Trump’s New “Board of Peace” Looks Like a Personal Power Move"
summary: "In early February, Donald Trump announced a new “Board of Peace” in Davos, with himself as chair for life. The board’s rules let him pick the agenda, choose members, and even cancel the 1 billion‑dollar fee that was supposed to grant permanent spots. Although the charter claims to help Gaza, it never mentions the conflict. Critics say the move is a self‑serving power grab that undermines the UN, leaves Palestinians marginal, and prioritises Trump’s ego over real peace."
