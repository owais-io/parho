title: "Democrats aim to ban former ICE workers from state jobs"
summary: "Democrats propose bans on former ICE employees in state jobs to curb Trump‑era deportation push. Bills in four states would bar those hired between 2025‑2029 from law enforcement, schools, and other civil service roles. They argue ICE acts unlawfully and have caused violence. None of the laws have passed yet and could face legal battles. The move reflects growing backlash against Trump‑era immigration tactics."
