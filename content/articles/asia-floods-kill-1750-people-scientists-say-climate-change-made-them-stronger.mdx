title: "Asia floods kill 1,750+ people; scientists say climate change made them stronger"
summary: "Scientists say the deadly monsoon floods that hit Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Malaysia in November 2023 were not normal. Climate change made the heavy rain 28–160% stronger, and the loss of forests in Sumatra made the water rise faster. More than 1,750 people died, many are still missing, and homes and jobs were lost, especially by the poorest. The study warns that such extreme storms will get worse unless we cut fossil‑fuel use."
