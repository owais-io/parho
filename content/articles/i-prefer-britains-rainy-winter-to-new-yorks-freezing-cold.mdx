title: "I Prefer Britain’s Rainy Winter to New York’s Freezing Cold"
summary: "I spent 17 years enjoying New York’s bright, freezing winters, but after returning to Britain I discovered that its constant, wet rain feels better. While the US coast is shivering with record‑low temperatures, the UK’s damp weather lets me walk in shorts without frostbite, and I love the gentle chill and the extra water for my plants. The author argues that a wet, gloomy winter can be a comfort rather than a curse."
