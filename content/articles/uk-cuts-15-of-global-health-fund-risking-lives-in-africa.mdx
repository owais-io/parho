summary: "UK’s 15% cut to the Global Fund—dropping its pledge from £1 billion to £850 million—comes as the country co‑hosts a major fundraising summit. Health groups warn that the money saved could force African nations to make impossible choices, cutting bed nets, medicines and new HIV drugs. They fear the drop may trigger similar cuts elsewhere and could add hundreds of thousands of extra deaths by 2040."
