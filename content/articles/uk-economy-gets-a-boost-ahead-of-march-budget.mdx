title: "UK Economy Gets a Boost Ahead of March Budget"
summary: "Three recent reports show the UK economy doing better than expected. Public finances posted a record surplus, retail sales jumped 1.8% in January, and business activity accelerated for the fastest rise since April 2024. These good numbers give Chancellor Rachel Reeves a stronger, more positive case for the March spring statement, with borrowing lower than forecast and interest‑rate cuts likely. However, high unemployment, a planned fuel‑duty rise and a local election add uncertainty."
