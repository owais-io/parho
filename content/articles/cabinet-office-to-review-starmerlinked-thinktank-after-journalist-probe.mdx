title: "Cabinet Office to Review Starmer‑Linked Thinktank After Journalist Probe"
summary: "The Cabinet Office is looking into a report by a PR firm that made untrue claims about journalists investigating Labour Together, a thinktank linked to Keir Starmer. The review will be led by the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team, not a formal inquiry. Starmer says he was unaware of the investigation, and the probe will establish facts. Conservatives and some Labour MPs want a formal investigation. The PR industry body is already examining the report."
