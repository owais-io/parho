title: "49ers Still a Playoff Contender Despite Heavy Injuries"
summary: "The 49ers went through a rough patch in Week 6 with key players like Fred Warner, Nick Bosa, Brock Purdy, George Kittle and Brandon Aiyuk out for long periods. Even so, they beat teams such as the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants and Panthers, and pulled off a 26‑8 win in Cleveland, their first there since 1984. With smart, mistake‑free play and solid coaching from Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers remain in the playoff conversation even in a season where no team is dominant."
