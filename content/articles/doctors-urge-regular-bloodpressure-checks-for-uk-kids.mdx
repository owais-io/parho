title: "Doctors urge regular blood‑pressure checks for UK kids"
summary: "Doctors want a national program to check kids' blood pressure in schools because rates have almost doubled in 20 years. High blood pressure in children can silently damage organs, raise the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney disease when adults. Early detection would let GPs treat kids before problems become serious. Experts say the rise is linked to weight, poor diet, and a more inactive lifestyle. They suggest adding blood‑pressure checks to existing school health checks."
