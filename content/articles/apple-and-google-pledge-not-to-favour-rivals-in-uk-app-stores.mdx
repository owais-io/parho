title: "Apple and Google pledge not to favour rivals in UK app stores"
summary: "Apple and Google have agreed to stop favouring their own apps over third‑party ones in the UK. They’ll be clearer about how they review apps, won’t push rivals down search lists, and will stop using rivals’ data to improve their own services. The UK’s competition watchdog, the CMA, let the firms sign voluntary promises, but says it can enforce stronger rules if they fail. The deal takes effect on April 1 and doesn’t touch the 30 % developer fee."
