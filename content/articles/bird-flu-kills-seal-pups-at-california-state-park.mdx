title: "Bird Flu Kills Seal Pups at California State Park"
summary: "A sudden bird‑flu outbreak at California’s Año Nuevo state park has killed around 30 weaned elephant seal pups, prompting the park to shut down seal‑watch tours. Scientists say this is the first time the highly‑pathogenic H5N1 strain has hit marine mammals in California, and they’re monitoring the colony closely. The seals are well‑studied, so researchers can track infections, but the virus’s source and spread remain unclear."
