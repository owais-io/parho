title: "Pauline Hanson’s Muslim Comments Could Trigger Police Investigation"
summary: "Pauline Hanson said things about Muslims that many people found hateful. Federal police heard complaints and said they were looking into the matter. She could face hate‑speech charges, but proving she meant to incite violence is hard. New laws cover some hate crimes, but experts say they don’t fully protect Muslims. Police and lawyers are still figuring out if the comments meet the legal test for a crime."
