title: "Democrats slam Trump’s illegal attack on Venezuela"
summary: "Democrats are furious after President Trump’s secret military raid on Venezuela. They say the move was illegal because Congress wasn’t told. Senators called it an unapproved war and accused the administration of lying about a “counter‑narcotics” operation. They’re pushing a war‑powers bill that would stop the president from attacking without Congress’s OK. Critics also say the raid is driven by money, not national security."
