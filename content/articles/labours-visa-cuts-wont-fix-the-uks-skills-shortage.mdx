title: "Labour’s Visa Cuts Won’t Fix the UK’s Skills Shortage"
summary: "Labour’s new plan to cut health‑care and middle‑skill visas and rely on domestic training won’t close the UK’s skills gap, research shows. Experts say the cuts could deepen the NHS crisis by shrinking the overseas workforce that fills many nursing and care roles. The study argues that raising pay, improving conditions, and training domestic workers – and even easing migration for key jobs – would be a better fix. The plan’s 10‑year wait for permanent residency could hurt already‑scarce NHS staff."
