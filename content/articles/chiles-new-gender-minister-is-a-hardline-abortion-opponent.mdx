title: "Chile’s new gender minister is a hard‑line abortion opponent"
summary: "Chile’s new president‑elect, José Antonio Kast, has chosen Judith Marín – a 30‑year‑old evangelical who has fought against abortion – to run the women’s equality ministry. Marín, who once shouted “return to the Lord” in a senate hearing, has said she believes life starts at conception and that only a man‑and‑woman family is right. Kast’s cabinet is largely right‑wing, with links to the old Pinochet regime, and Chile’s abortion law is currently very limited."
