title: "Scientists Make Lab Womb Lining to Study Early Pregnancy"
summary: "Scientists have grown a fake womb lining in a lab dish and used it to watch human embryos attach and grow. The lining, made from cells taken from healthy women, allowed the embryos to produce the hormone that shows up on pregnancy tests. By seeing the messages between the embryo and lining, scientists can learn why many embryos fail to implant, which could boost IVF success."
