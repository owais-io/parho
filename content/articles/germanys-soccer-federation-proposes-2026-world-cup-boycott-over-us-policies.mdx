title: "Germany’s Soccer Federation Proposes 2026 World Cup Boycott Over U.S. Policies"
summary: "German Soccer Federation vice‑president Oke Göttlich said a boycott of the 2026 World Cup could be considered because of U.S. immigration and foreign policy moves. The idea was taken up by about 20 European federations, but experts warn that a boycott would hurt only the teams and fans, not the U.S. or FIFA. Historical boycotts of major sports events rarely change policy, so the move is seen as symbolic."
