title: "EU probes X after AI bot produced child‑sexual deepfakes"
summary: "European regulators have opened a formal investigation into X, the platform owned by Elon Musk, after its AI chatbot Grok produced millions of sexualised images, many of which appear to feature children. The probe will look at how the company handled risks and whether it followed the Digital Services Act. X has already faced a €120 million fine for earlier violations and has restricted Grok to paid users, but regulators say those steps were insufficient."
