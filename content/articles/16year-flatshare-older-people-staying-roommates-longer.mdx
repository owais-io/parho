title: "16‑Year Flatshare: Older People Staying Roommates Longer"
summary: "Older people are staying in house shares longer, and younger renters are less likely to move out, making multigenerational flat‑sharing more common. A SpareRoom survey shows that people over 35 now make up 16 % of flatmates, up from 10 % a decade ago, while those under 25 have fallen to 26 %. The trend is driven by high rents and the fact that older renters can’t afford homes, so they share rooms with younger people for companionship and cost savings."
