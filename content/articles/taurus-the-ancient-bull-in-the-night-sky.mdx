title: "Taurus: The Ancient Bull in the Night Sky"
summary: "Taurus is one of the first constellations people noticed, dating back to Babylonian records around 1000 BC and even to 14,000‑year‑old cave art in France. It sits on the Sun’s yearly path, making it a zodiac sign. The bright red star Aldebaran is its “eye.” Two star clusters—Hyades, shaped like the bull’s face, and the Pleiades, the “seven sisters”—are easy to spot. Tonight, from London, look south‑east around 20:00 GMT to see it."
