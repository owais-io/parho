title: "Dartmoor’s Wet Walks: Muddy Paths and Surprising Snipes"
summary: "The author spends a wet winter walk on Dartmoor’s Gibbet Hill, where rain makes everything puddled. He loves the bleak, muddy moor but also the surprise of seeing snipes, small birds that rush up when you step near. Snipes look like little rockets, with long bills and quick zig‑zags. Although rare, about 75,000 pairs breed in the UK each year. Walking in mud is worth it for the chance to spot them."
