title: "Supermarkets could help UK shoppers eat more local fish"
summary: "Researchers say supermarkets could push Brits to eat more local, small fish like sardines and anchovies instead of mostly imported cod, tuna, salmon and prawns. A study found most UK people eat less fish than health guidelines recommend, especially young people. Only about 20% of fish sold in shops is local. The study suggests using promotions and recipe cards could encourage people to buy and try local fish, boosting health and local economies."
