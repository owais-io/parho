title: "Primark’s European sales drop triggers company profit warning"
summary: "Primark’s European stores are losing market share, with sales falling 5.7% compared to a 1.7% rise in the UK. This slump caused Associated British Foods to cut its profit forecast and share price fell 14%. The drop is blamed on weaker consumer demand, lower brand buzz and growing online rivals. Despite the dip, analysts still expect about £1 billion profit this year, so the problem is not a crisis."
