title: "Why Nigel Farage’s past racism isn’t shocking"
summary: "The letter says that Nigel Farage was only a teen when he did racist things, and that was normal in the private school he attended. The writer, who went to a similar school, recalls daily abuse of Jewish, Muslim, and other minority students. Teachers even treated Farage’s behaviour as “high spirits.” The author points out that these schools still taught a sense of superiority, and hopes they have since changed."
