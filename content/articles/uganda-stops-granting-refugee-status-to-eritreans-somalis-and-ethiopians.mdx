title: "Uganda Stops Granting Refugee Status to Eritreans, Somalis and Ethiopians"
summary: "Uganda has stopped granting asylum to people from Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia because it is running short on money. The refugee minister said the countries aren’t in war, so they won’t be given status. Uganda used to get $240 million a year from the UN, but now receives less than $100 million, and this year only $18 million. With cuts from the US and UK, many refugees risk being stuck in legal limbo and losing aid."
