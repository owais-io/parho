title: "Why Spanish Isn’t Better Than French in Schools"
summary: "Some British teachers and politicians say Spanish is the best language to teach because it’s useful for jobs. But learning a language is more than counting speakers. It builds thinking skills, memory, and cultural awareness. Whether it’s Spanish, French, German or a minority language, the real value is in loving the language, not just using it for work. Schools should encourage this passion."
