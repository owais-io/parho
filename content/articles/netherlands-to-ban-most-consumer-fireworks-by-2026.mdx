title: "Netherlands to Ban Most Consumer Fireworks by 2026"
summary: "Last year's New Year's Eve fireworks caused over 1,200 injuries, two deaths, and a huge hit on Dutch emergency services. In response, Dutch lawmakers will ban most consumer fireworks before 2026, making the Netherlands the second EU country after Ireland to do so. The ban aims to curb danger, reduce pollution and protect pets, but sellers fear cross‑border sales will keep the problem alive. Parliament approved the law, pending compensation for the fireworks industry."
