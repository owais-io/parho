title: "The Endless Grey of Winter Weather"
summary: "I write about how the grey, wet, and chilly weather from late autumn to winter makes me feel down. Even when the sun briefly appears, the gloom lingers, and the day turns back to grey. I find the occasional red lights uncomfortable and the brief snow fades quickly. Nights are darker but better than grey. A nurse told me to cheer up and look forward to spring, but I’m still waiting."
