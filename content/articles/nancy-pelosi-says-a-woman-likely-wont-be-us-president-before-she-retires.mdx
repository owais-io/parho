summary: "Nancy Pelosi says it is unlikely a woman will become U.S. president while she is still alive, calling the barrier a “marble ceiling” instead of a glass one. The former House speaker, who is retiring after 36 years in Congress, noted that Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in 2016 and 2024. She still believes a woman will be president within the next generation, but probably not before she retires."
