title: "Is the Islamic State linked to the Bondi beach attack?"
summary: "Police say the two men who attacked Bondi beach may have been inspired by the Islamic State. The Islamic State, once a powerful group in Iraq and Syria, lost most of its territory but still spreads propaganda online. It targets Shia Muslims, minorities and even Jews, using violent rhetoric. Its attacks abroad are usually carried out by lone‑wolf followers. The link to protests over Gaza is unclear, but the group opposes nation‑states."
