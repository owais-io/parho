title: "Car makers could face fines after six months of Australia’s new emissions rules"
summary: "Australia’s new car emissions rule says manufacturers must sell vehicles that average lower CO₂ per kilometre. After six months, 40 of 59 companies met the target and earned credits to sell, while 19 firms—including Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, and Hyundai—missed it and could face up to $25 million in fines or must buy credits. The government says the rule is working, but EV sales are still low and the target may need tightening."
