title: "Bookmakers Bet Labour Will Win Next UK Election"
summary: "Star Sports, a major UK bookmaker, has lifted Labour’s odds to 13/8, making the party the favourite to win the next general election. Reform UK’s odds slipped to 15/8, partly because a new Elon Musk‑backed group, Restore Britain, is drawing support away from the far‑right. While the shift gives Labour a boost, the article warns the party could misread the mood and play it too safe, losing the chance to stand out."
