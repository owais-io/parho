title: "Ocean Warming Drives Big Fish Losses"
summary: "Scientists studied 33,000 fish groups over 28 years and found that every 0.1 °C of ocean‑floor warming per decade drops fish numbers by 7.2%. A single year can see a 20 % drop when the water keeps getting warmer. Short‑term heatwaves can give some species a temporary bump, but the long‑term trend is a serious loss. Overfishing makes the problem worse, and governments risk misreading the data if they ignore the steady warming."
