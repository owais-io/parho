title: "Do £100,000 Salaries Still Pay? London Workers Say They're Short‑changed"
summary: "People who earn £100,000 a year in London say they’re being left behind. Higher taxes cut their take‑home pay, and they lose free childcare. The biggest hit is the city’s sky‑high rents and house prices, which keep a large portion of their wages on the rent bucket. Because incomes haven’t kept up, many would postpone buying a home or having kids. The result is a growing gap between past and present expectations."
