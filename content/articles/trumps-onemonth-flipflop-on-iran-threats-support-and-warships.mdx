title: "Trump’s One‑Month Flip‑Flop on Iran: Threats, Support, and Warships"
summary: "Over a month, President Trump went back and forth on Iran. He first warned the country to stop building weapons or face airstrikes, then promised to back Iranian protesters, and later threatened to send warships and impose tariffs. His tone swung from aggressive to seemingly supportive, but the final move was a show‑of‑force with US naval vessels. The rapid changes made it hard to know what the US actually wants."
