title: "Internet Shutdowns Are Now Cheaper and Easier"
summary: "In Iran’s January blackout, people still used local apps but couldn’t see outside news or share evidence of violence. That “splinternet” shows how governments can cut off their own internet. New censorship tech from China and others is making shut‑downs cheaper, while US support for anti‑censorship tools has been cut. The move toward sovereign data and national internet control risks replacing one set of gatekeepers with another, threatening global digital freedom."
