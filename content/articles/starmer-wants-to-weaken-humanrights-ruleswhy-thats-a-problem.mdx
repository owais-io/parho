title: "Starmer Wants to Weaken Human‑Rights Rules—Why That’s a Problem"
summary: "The article says that Keir Starmer and Denmark’s leader are pushing for stricter asylum rules that would cut protection for people fleeing danger. They claim it will make the public feel safer, but the writer argues it actually hurts the most vulnerable—children cut from parents, survivors of trafficking, and those at risk of torture. The piece says the real fix is to handle the backlog and create safer paths, not to lower human‑rights standards."
