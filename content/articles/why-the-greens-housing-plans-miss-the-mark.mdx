title: "Why the Greens’ Housing Plans Miss the Mark"
summary: "Siân Berry urged Labour to buy more landlord homes to boost social housing, but the author points out that Brighton & Hove’s Labour council has already been doing just that. They’ve bought and managed homes, while the Greens have only talked about it and failed to fix council‑house repairs or enforce landlord licensing. The letter argues that real progress happens when policies are actually implemented, not just talked about."
