title: "Jim Beam to Pause Production at Kentucky Plant in 2026"
summary: "Jim Beam will stop making whiskey at its main distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, for the whole of 2026. The company says the pause gives it time to upgrade the plant and review how much to produce next year. Workers will still be employed, and the company is talking with its union. Other Kentucky sites, including bottling and a visitor centre, will keep running. The move comes as the industry faces higher taxes and trade uncertainty."
