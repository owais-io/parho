title: "Starmer’s China visit could backfire over jailed Hong Kong journalist"
summary: "The UK tried to free Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong pro‑democracy figure, but China convicted him on trumped‑up charges. Britain’s response has been weak, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans a trade trip to China in January. The trip risks entangling the UK with China’s security threats and human‑rights abuses. The author urges Starmer to link the visit to Lai’s release and to strengthen ties with Europe instead."
