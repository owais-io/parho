title: "Fake anti‑Labour videos on YouTube drew 1.2 billion views in 2025"
summary: "A study found more than 150 anonymous YouTube channels spread fake, anti‑Labour videos that got almost 1.2 billion views in 2025. The videos, made with cheap AI scripts and cheap narration, target the UK prime minister and stir up false claims. Many of the channels were removed after the Guardian highlighted them, but the problem shows how easy it is to profit from political hate. UK officials and YouTube are now working together to shut them down."
