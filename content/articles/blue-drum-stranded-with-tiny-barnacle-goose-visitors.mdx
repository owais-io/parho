title: "Blue Drum Stranded with Tiny Barnacle “Goose” Visitors"
summary: "A friend’s photo showed a blue drum barrel washed up on a rainy Hampshire beach, covered in a splash of single‑use plastic and driftwood. Inside the barrel was a sea‑foul of barnacles that look like tiny goose heads – the “barnacle goose.” These creatures are rare here but travel with currents from warmer seas. Most barnacles can survive a few days out of water, but the barrel was too heavy to haul back to sea, so the barnacles likely died."
