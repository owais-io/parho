title: "Supreme Court case sparks tense rallies in Washington DC"
summary: "On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments over whether transgender children can play sports in schools. In Washington, D.C., two large crowds gathered: one of trans‑rights supporters, cheering for a West Virginia athlete, and another of opponents, demanding bans on trans athletes. The protests grew more hostile, with shoves, shouting, and police arrests. The clash reflects growing pressure from conservative groups and the Trump administration to limit LGBTQ+ protections and change school‑sports rules."
