title: "Australia’s economy grows again thanks to data‑center boom and higher household spending"
summary: "Australia’s economy grew 2.1% last year and rose 0.4% in the September quarter, helped by a big jump in data‑centre spending and higher household bills. But people’s real incomes didn’t rise, and inflation is still high at 3.8%. The Reserve Bank may pause cuts and even raise rates. Productivity is still slow, and business construction helped, but wages lag behind."
