title: "Supreme Court Says Trump Tariffs Are Illegal"
summary: "Supreme Court says Trump used too much power to put tariffs on goods. A 6‑3 decision said the 1977 emergency law didn’t give him that authority. Democrats say the ruling saves ordinary people from higher prices. Trump calls it a “disgrace” and hints at a new plan. Republicans are mixed: some praise the check on the president, others say Congress can still work with him. The vote shows Congress still controls trade taxes."
