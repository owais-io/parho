title: "Australia’s 2026 World Cup Group Looks Manageable"
summary: "Australia’s 2026 World Cup group has a clear advantage. They’ll face the United States, Paraguay and one of Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo or Romania – no former champions or top‑pot teams. The match‑day travel will be easy and the heat less intense on the West Coast. Coach Ivan Popovic says the Socceroos’ solid defence and quick counter‑attacks can win them three points, or at least keep the group fight alive."
