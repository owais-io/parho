title: "NSW law banning Sydney marches faces court challenge"
summary: "A NSW court heard protest groups argue that a law banning marches in Sydney’s CBD after the Bondi terror attack actually hurts social cohesion and cuts freedom of expression. The law stops organisers from using the “form 1” permit system, giving police broad power to end protests. The state says it protects the community, but critics say it is too broad and unnecessary. The appeal will decide if the law stands."
