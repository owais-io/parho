title: "Experts Warn New NDIS Tool Isn’t Tested for All Disabilities"
summary: "Australian experts say the new NDIS support‑planning tool, called I‑CAN, hasn’t been properly tested on many disability groups, especially autistic people. They worry that if it is rolled out without extra research, it could give wrong support plans and cause problems. The tool uses a long interview and a computer program to set budgets. The NDIA says it will train assessors and roll it out over five years, but critics say more testing is needed."
