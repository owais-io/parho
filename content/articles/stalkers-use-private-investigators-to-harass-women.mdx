title: "Stalkers Use Private Investigators to Harass Women"
summary: "The Guardian found that some men use private investigators to stalk ex‑partners, even after court orders. With no licence system, anyone can advertise detective services. Investigators have police or military experience and can secretly follow, photograph, and even bug victims. The report notes dozens of cases where PIs tracked women to domestic‑abuse shelters, putting them at new risk. The lack of regulation lets stalkers outsource abuse, raising urgent calls for a licensing law."
