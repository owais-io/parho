title: "How to Green Your Superannuation"
summary: "Australia’s superannuation funds hold about $4.5 trillion, and many still invest in coal, oil and gas. New rules let some funds add more fossil‑fuel stocks, while others are accused of “greenwashing.” Most Australians want their retirement money to support net‑zero and biodiversity. Members can choose greener funds, check the Responsible Investment Association’s list, or pressure their provider with calls and social media. The government is also reviewing “green” labels to protect investors."
