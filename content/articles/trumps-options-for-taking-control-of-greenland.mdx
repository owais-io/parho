title: "Trump’s options for taking control of Greenland"
summary: "Trump wants Greenland, a mostly independent Danish territory rich in minerals. He could try to buy it, but most Greenlanders say no. He might offer a “free‑association” deal, letting Greenland stay independent while the U.S. keeps a military presence. The U.S. already has treaties giving it access to bases and airspace. An outright invasion is unlikely and would hurt U.S. relations with Europe, so Washington probably will try diplomacy instead."
