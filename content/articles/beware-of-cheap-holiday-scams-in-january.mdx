title: "Beware of Cheap Holiday Scams in January"
summary: "In January, scammers use social media ads to sell fake holiday deals that look cheaper than real ones. They copy legitimate travel sites and lure people with “once‑only” offers, then ask for payment by bank transfer. After the money is sent, the contact disappears and the trip never happens. The average loss is about £3,500. To stay safe, book only on trusted websites, check the URL, avoid bank‑transfer payments, and report fraud to Action Fraud."
