title: "People Turning to ChatGPT for Comfort as Churches Decline"
summary: "I attended two funerals: one for a successful atheist and one for a quiet Catholic. The atheist funeral praised achievements but left a deep sadness, while the Catholic service offered comfort through rituals and belief in an afterlife. With more Australians becoming non‑religious, many seek comfort elsewhere. ChatGPT and other AIs now provide companionship, therapy and soothing reassurance, filling the void left by declining faith. AI like ChatGPT offers reassurance similar to what the church used to give."
