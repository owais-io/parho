title: "Trump‑backed US coup in Venezuela breaks international law"
summary: "The US staged a coup against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with Trump saying the country will be “run” and even taking control of its oil. The move is framed as a fight against crime, but it violates international law and has no approval from other governments or the UN. European leaders and others warn that the takeover shows the US can act without consequences, raising concerns about future power grabs worldwide."
