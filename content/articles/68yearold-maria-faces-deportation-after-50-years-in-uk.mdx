title: "68‑Year‑Old Maria Faces Deportation After 50 Years in UK"
summary: "Maria, a 68‑year‑old Dutch citizen, has lived in the UK for almost 50 years. After a brief fire, a hotel job, and a guilty plea for allowing a brothel, she received a letter from the Home Office telling her she will be deported. The UK uses a vague “serious harm” rule that could still target her, even though her sentence was only a suspended four‑month term. Her lawyer argues the deportation is cruel and disproportionate."
