title: "From Farmland to Forest: A 20‑Year Transformation at Low Burnhall Wood"
summary: "In 2008, the Woodland Trust turned a patch of farm land near Durham into a thriving woodland. They planted 94,500 trees, and today the area is a lush mix of oak, chestnut, and other native species. Birds and animals are already thriving, dropping acorns and berries that help the forest grow. After a few more generations, the new trees will blend naturally into the surrounding landscape, making the old fields disappear forever."
