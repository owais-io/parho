title: "Flamm Art Festival Lights Up Bodmin"
summary: "The Flamm festival turns Bodmin into a modern art hub this weekend, bringing contemporary works from Cornwall and beyond into a town that usually goes unnoticed. Highlights include a clay sculpture of jackdaws, a sound piece on a railway platform, a bright pink “walking sculpture,” and alternative maps showing local favourite spots. The event also displays pieces from the Liverpool Biennial and repurposes military museum images. Organisers say the festival will boost pride, community bonds, and even economic growth."
