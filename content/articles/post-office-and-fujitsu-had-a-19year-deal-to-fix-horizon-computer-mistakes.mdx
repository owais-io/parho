title: "Post Office and Fujitsu had a 19‑year deal to fix Horizon computer mistakes"
summary: "A 2006 contract between the Post Office and Fujitsu shows the two companies agreed to fix errors in the Horizon computer system that let them change post office balances remotely. The deal contradicts the Post Office’s earlier claim that no bugs existed. The discovery explains why hundreds of postmasters were wrongly accused, jailed and, in some cases, pushed to suicide. The Post Office apologises and is working on compensation."
