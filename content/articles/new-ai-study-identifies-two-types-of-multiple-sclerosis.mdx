title: "New AI Study Identifies Two Types of Multiple Sclerosis"
summary: "Researchers used AI, a simple blood test and MRI scans to spot two new biological types of multiple sclerosis. The first, called early sNfL, shows high protein levels early and quick brain damage, making it more aggressive. The second, late sNfL, shows brain shrinkage first, with protein rising later, meaning a slower disease. Knowing which type a patient has could help doctors pick the right treatment and monitor better."
