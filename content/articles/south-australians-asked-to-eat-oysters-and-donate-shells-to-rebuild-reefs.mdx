title: "South Australians Asked to Eat Oysters and Donate Shells to Rebuild Reefs"
summary: "South Australians are encouraged to enjoy local oysters, then clean and send their shells to help rebuild marine reefs. The shells, plus new limestone structures, will give oysters a place to grow. Scientists use underwater speakers that play shrimp sounds to attract baby oysters. The new reefs will filter water and help stop harmful algal blooms that have wrecked beaches. The state will fund 25 community reefs and offers a volunteer portal so people can contribute."
