title: "Trade Unions Call for Lower Bank of England Rates to Help Consumers"
summary: "The Trades Union Congress (TUC) is asking the Bank of England to lower interest rates so that people can spend more. They say Britain’s borrowing cost is keeping consumers from buying, making UK growth weaker than most other developed countries. The Bank’s policy committee left rates unchanged this month, but the TUC wants quick cuts. The move could give shoppers more money and lift confidence for households and businesses."
