title: "Supermarkets' Unit Pricing Tricks Customers into Paying More"
summary: "Many Australian supermarkets, like Woolworths, Coles and Aldi, are selling fresh fruit and veg by the item instead of by weight. Smaller pieces often cost more per kilogram, so shoppers pay more when they pick “kids” bananas or single cucumbers. Because the stores rarely show the price per kilogram, customers can’t easily compare deals, especially online where prices may change with weight. The move has sparked calls for clearer pricing rules."
