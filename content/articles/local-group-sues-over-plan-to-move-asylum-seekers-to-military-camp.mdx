summary: "Residents of Crowborough, east Sussex, have taken the government to the high court after plans were announced to house 540 asylum seekers in the town’s military training camp. The local group Crowborough Shield says the move was made secretly, without planning permission or a public consultation, and could harm the nearby Ashdown Forest.
