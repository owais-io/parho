title: "Trump’s Resorts Have Become a Source of Money and Political Access"
summary: "Trump’s private resorts, especially Mar‑a‑Lago, are being used as a cash‑in‑hand for politicians, donors and even foreign governments. U.S. campaigns and committees have spent at least $1.3 million at his properties since January 2025, while many foreign companies and governments also pay for events that aren’t publicly disclosed. The president keeps his businesses in a family trust, not a blind trust, raising conflict‑of‑interest concerns and possible violations of the emoluments clause."
