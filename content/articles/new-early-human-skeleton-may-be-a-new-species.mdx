title: "New Early Human Skeleton May Be a New Species"
summary: "Scientists say the almost complete skeleton called Little Foot, found in South Africa, may be a new species of early human ancestor. The skeleton was first thought to belong to two known species, but new research shows it differs in key skull features. The study, led by Australian scientists, suggests Little Foot could represent a whole new branch of the human family tree. Its exact age is still debated."
