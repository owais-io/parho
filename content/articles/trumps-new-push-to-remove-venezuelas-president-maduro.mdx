summary: "Trump is again pushing to get rid of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. After his first term he even talked about a possible military invasion, but advisers stopped him. Now the US has moved more troops to the Caribbean, hit drug boats, and tightened sanctions. He even threatened Maduro with safe passage if he leaves. The move may push more Venezuelans to leave for the US, but critics warn it could lead to war."
