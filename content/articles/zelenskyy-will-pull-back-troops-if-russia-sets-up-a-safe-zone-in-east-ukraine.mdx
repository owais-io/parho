title: "Zelenskyy Will Pull Back Troops if Russia Sets Up a Safe Zone in East Ukraine"
summary: "President Zelenskyy said he would pull his troops from eastern Donbas if Russia does the same and the area becomes a demilitarised zone watched by forces. This could help end the war, and the U.S. and Kyiv are close to a new plan, though Moscow may oppose it. In Russia, many people expect the war to finish in 2026. Meanwhile, bombings in Odesa have spilled sunflower oil into the sea, harming wildlife, and Russian air defence shot down 25 Ukrainian drones."
