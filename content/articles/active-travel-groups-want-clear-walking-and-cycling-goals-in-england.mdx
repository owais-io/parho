title: "Active travel groups want clear walking and cycling goals in England"
summary: "More than 50 transport and health groups wrote to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, saying England’s plans for walking and cycling are too vague. They want clear, measurable targets, like getting 50% of short trips in towns and cities by 2030. The groups also call for a national, connected network of safe routes. They worry the current strategy’s goals are hard to measure, and that without set targets the big investment won’t deliver results."
