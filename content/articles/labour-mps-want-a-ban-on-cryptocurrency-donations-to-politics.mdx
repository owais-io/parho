title: "Labour MPs want a ban on cryptocurrency donations to politics"
summary: "Seven senior Labour MPs are asking the government to stop people from giving money in cryptocurrency to political parties. They say crypto hides the money’s source and could let foreign governments influence elections. The UK government is looking into a ban, but it may not be ready for the upcoming elections bill. The change would affect Reform UK, the first party to accept crypto donations."
