title: "Jeremy Corbyn becomes Your Party’s new leader, but the party still fights to stay relevant"
summary: "The party’s online vote ran late, but Corbyn’s slate won 14 of 24 seats on the central committee, making him the de‑facto leader. Inside the party, old feuds continue – former MP Zarah Sultana says there should be no more witch‑hunts, and a splinter group plans a new party. Polls are weak and the Greens are attracting younger voters, so Your Party faces a tough road to get votes."
