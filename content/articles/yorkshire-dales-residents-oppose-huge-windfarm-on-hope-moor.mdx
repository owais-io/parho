title: "Yorkshire Dales Residents Oppose Huge Windfarm on Hope Moor"
summary: "A 100‑MW windfarm called Hope Moor, with 20 turbines that would be almost 200 m tall, is planned on a deep‑peat moor near the Yorkshire Dales national park. The project is part of the UK’s drive to cut carbon, but locals worry it will damage wildlife, the landscape and the peat carbon sink, add roads, and cause noise. Residents have formed an action group, and the planning decision will be made by the national inspectorate, not local councils."
