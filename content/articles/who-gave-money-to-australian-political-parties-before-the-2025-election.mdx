summary: "Before the 2025 Australian election, companies and people spent $131 million on political parties. Big tech firms, mining and fossil‑fuel companies, banks, gambling operators and hotel groups were the biggest donors. The Labor, Liberal, Greens and Nationals each received more than $10 million from these industries, while Clive Palmer’s own party took over $50 million. Many smaller donations below the reporting limit remain hidden, making the true amount of “dark money” unclear."
