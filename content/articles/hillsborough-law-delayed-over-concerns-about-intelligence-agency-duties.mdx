title: "Hillsborough law delayed over concerns about intelligence agency duties"
summary: "British lawmakers have postponed the Hillsborough law, which would require public officials and contractors to be honest after disasters. MPs and families worry the bill gives too much protection to intelligence officers, like MI5, who could hide mistakes. Families of Manchester Arena bombing victims demand the law cover MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. The government says it will keep national security safe while adding more clear rules."
