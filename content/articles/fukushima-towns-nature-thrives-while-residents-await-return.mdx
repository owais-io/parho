title: "Fukushima Towns: Nature Thrives While Residents Await Return"
summary: "Fifteen years after the 2011 earthquake and nuclear disaster, the school in Kumamachi sits frozen in time while weeds, trees, and animals have taken over. Clean‑up crews have removed contaminated soil, but radiation still blocks many people from coming home. Scientists say wildlife, especially wild boar, has flourished, but some argue the area should become a nature preserve instead of a re‑occupied village. Residents like Norio Kimura still hope to rebuild and remember their lost family."
