title: "Trump warns of chaos if Supreme Court overturns tariffs"
summary: "Trump says if the Supreme Court cancels his tariffs it will create a huge mess. He warned reversing them would be difficult because businesses might have already paid, and it would take years to sort out refunds. The case was filed by 12 states and small firms that say the president had no legal power to impose the tariffs. The Supreme Court heard the arguments, and Trump warned the decision could force the country to pay a lot of money."
