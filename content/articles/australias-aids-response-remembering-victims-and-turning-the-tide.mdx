title: "Australia’s AIDS Response: Remembering Victims and Turning the Tide"
summary: "In the 1980s, AIDS was feared, misunderstood, and tied to shame, especially in Australia where it hit gay men and drug users first. The government, led by activists, ran safe‑sex campaigns, set up needle exchanges, and later introduced combination therapy. A powerful memory tool—the Aids quilt—had people recite names of those who died, giving the community a way to mourn and demand support. The focus on prevention and funding turned Australia into a model for handling the epidemic."
