title: "Moving sandbanks create dangerous navigation risks"
summary: "Offshore sandbanks can shift during storms, making them hard to avoid. The Goodwin Sands off Kent’s coast have moved, wrecking about 2,000 ships over centuries. Lighthouses were built in 1634 to guide vessels. Waves erode and deposit sand, reshaping and relocating the banks. Modern sonar and live charts let mariners see changes quickly, but the shifting sand still poses a serious threat."
