title: "Why the Washington Post is Falling Behind"
summary: "The New York Times is booming, but the Washington Post is slipping. The Times has steady leaders who pushed a digital overhaul early, built a big staff and gained millions of online readers. After Jeff Bezos bought the Post, a strong editor helped it grow, but when that editor left and a weak boss took over, the paper’s culture broke down. Layoffs, a lost editorial voice, and a shift toward Trump‑friendly content led to big subscription drops."

Layoffs, a lost editorial voice, and a shift toward Trump‑friendly content led to big subscription drops.
