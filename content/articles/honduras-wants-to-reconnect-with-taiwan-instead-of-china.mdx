title: "Honduras Wants to Reconnect With Taiwan Instead of China"
summary: "The outcome of Honduras’ November election is still unclear, but both main candidates plan to drop ties with China and re‑establish relations with Taiwan. Honduras ended its 82‑year friendship with Taipei in 2023, but now says it saw no benefit from China. Taiwan has only 12 diplomatic partners, and China has tried to bribe or pressure other Latin American states. U.S. support and China’s broken promises make Taiwan a more appealing choice."
