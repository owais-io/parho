title: "The Congo rainforest is ignored, but it’s vital for the planet"
summary: "In a 2023 meeting in Brazzaville, scientists and leaders from the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo rainforests talked about saving forests. But the Congo basin, the world’s second‑largest forest, is getting far less attention and money than the Amazon or Southeast Asia. It stores huge amounts of carbon and supplies water to much of Africa, but research funding is tiny. Poor data, corruption stereotypes, and security worries keep investors away. Experts say we need new scientists and immediate money to protect the basin."
