title: "Rebuilding Our Stone Home with Local Lime"
summary: "The author’s stone house, built from local limestone, has old mortar that’s been damaged by modern cement. To fix it, she booked a lime‑pointing workshop with her family. The instructor taught them how quicklime turns into a workable mortar over time and why lime is good for old buildings: it’s breathable, can pull damp out, heals cracks, and can be reused. After mixing, applying, and sanding the lime, the wall’s joints look neat and strong."
