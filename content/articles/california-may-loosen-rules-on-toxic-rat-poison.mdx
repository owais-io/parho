title: "California may loosen rules on toxic rat poison"
summary: "California’s pesticide department plans to relax rules on the state’s most toxic rat poison, despite a new wildlife report showing the poison kills many animals, including endangered species. The anticoagulant poison stays in the body for days and builds up in predators. Environmental groups say there’s no proof it’s more effective than other poisons and warn it harms raptors, mountain lions and others. Lawmakers urge the agency to backtrack, but the governor’s response is still pending."
