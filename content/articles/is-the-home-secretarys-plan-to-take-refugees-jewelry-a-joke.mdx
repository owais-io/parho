title: "Is the Home Secretary's plan to take refugees' jewelry a joke?"
summary: "Shabana Mahmood, Labour’s Home Secretary, has suggested the UK could take refugees’ jewelry and other valuables to help pay for their housing. The idea comes from a 2016 Danish law, but Denmark only used it 17 times in six years and faced heavy criticism. Critics argue the move would target the most vulnerable and is legally doubtful. Many see it as a far‑fetched, unworkable policy—almost a joke, but still potentially harmful."
