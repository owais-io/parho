title: "Canada’s climate “realism” is a surrender to fossil fuels"
summary: "Last week the UK made bold climate moves—banning new North Sea oil licences, tightening taxes, and cutting fossil‑fuel subsidies. Canada did the opposite, signing a deal with Alberta to build a new oil‑sands pipeline and delay methane rules. The move cuts Canada short of its COP28 pledge to phase out fossil fuels, and experts say the promised carbon‑capture tech won’t keep the climate safe. While the world is rushing toward clean energy, Canada’s new policy looks like a step backward."
