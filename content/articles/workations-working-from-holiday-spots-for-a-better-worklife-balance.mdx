summary: "Workations let people mix work with vacation. Katherine, a university conference manager, started by extending a trip to Australia and working from a friend’s house. Many others follow, using petsitting or short stays to explore new places while keeping deadlines. Companies are catching on: one‑fifth of managers have taken a workation, and 77% now have policies. Benefits include mental health and flexibility, but firms worry about data security and fairness. The trend shows a shift toward blending work and life."
