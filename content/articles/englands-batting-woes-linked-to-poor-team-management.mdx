title: "England’s batting woes linked to poor team management"
summary: "England struggled in a Boxing Day Test at the MCG, with openers Ben Duckett and Jacob Bethell out cheaply. Their poor performances highlight bigger problems: the England camp’s loose organisation, lack of guidance, and the way players are shuffled between formats. Critics say the team’s management has failed to create a solid environment for talent to thrive, turning promising players into nervous, over‑pressured performers. The series could suffer if these issues aren’t addressed."
