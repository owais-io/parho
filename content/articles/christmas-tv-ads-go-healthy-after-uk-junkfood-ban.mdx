title: "Christmas TV ads go healthy after UK junk‑food ban"
summary: "This year, Christmas TV ads in the UK have gone lean because a new rule bans junk‑food spots before 9 p.m. and on the web. Major supermarkets – Tesco, Waitrose, Asda – dropped images of puddings and sweets and now show fruit, pies and other ‘healthier’ foods. The rule is still confusing – some treats are allowed, some healthy items are not – and food firms are moving money into billboards and other media."
