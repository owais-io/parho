title: "Foreign corporations can sue the UK for billions in secret tribunals"
summary: "Foreign companies can use special overseas courts to sue governments, even the UK, over laws that hurt their profits. These secret courts have no appeals and can award huge sums—sometimes billions—based on imagined losses. The UK has already won big payouts for mining and oil firms and now faces more cases, like a coal mine in Cumbria and a Russian oligarch. This threatens to chill climate actions and erodes democracy, but the government keeps pushing to keep the rules."
