title: "Holiday season calls for hope and peace worldwide"
summary: "In 2025 the world faces more wars and fear than since 1946, from Ukraine to Gaza to Sudan. The Guardian reminds us of theologian Paul Tillich’s lesson that hope is essential, even in pain. Recent attacks, rising antisemitism and Russia’s “hybrid warfare” threaten Europe. Yet everyday acts of courage—like a Jewish couple stopping a gunman, Ukrainians enduring shelling, and Sudanese volunteers feeding people—show we can choose compassion. The Christmas Eve service at Cambridge encourages this hopeful spirit."
