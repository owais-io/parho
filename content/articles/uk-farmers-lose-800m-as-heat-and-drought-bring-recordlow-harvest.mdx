title: "UK farmers lose £800m as heat and drought bring record‑low harvest"
summary: "Record heat and drought in 2025 left UK arable farmers with a £800 million loss. Crop yields fell about 20 %, making the harvest the second‑worst since 1984. Farmers say climate change is making it too risky to plant and that they need more help, especially with green‑farming schemes that boost soil and give cash. The cost of food like butter, beef and coffee has also risen sharply."
