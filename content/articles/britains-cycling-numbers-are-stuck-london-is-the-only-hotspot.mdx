title: "Britain’s Cycling Numbers Are Stuck, London Is the Only Hotspot"
summary: "After Team GB won medals at the 2008 Olympics, people said Britain would become a cycling nation. In reality, bike sales and daily trips across England have stayed flat for years, with a small spike during Covid. The only bright spot is London, where trips are up 43% and almost 1.5 million riders a day. The rise comes from good government support and safety upgrades. Across the rest of the UK, fewer regular riders mean the country remains more car‑than‑bike."
