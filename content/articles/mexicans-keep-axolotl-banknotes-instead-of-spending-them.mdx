title: "Mexicans Keep Axolotl Banknotes Instead of Spending Them"
summary: "In 2021, Mexico issued a 50‑peso bill featuring Gorda, a famous museum axolotl. A recent survey shows 12.9 million people still hold these notes, even though they’re worth only about $3. About $150 million worth are out of circulation, with some rare ones selling for up to 100 times their face value. Most collectors keep the bills because they love the design, which celebrates Mexico’s endangered axolotl, a creature linked to ancient Aztec culture."
