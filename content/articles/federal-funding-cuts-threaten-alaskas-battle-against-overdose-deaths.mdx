title: "Federal Funding Cuts Threaten Alaska’s Battle Against Overdose Deaths"
summary: "Alaska could lose a huge chunk of federal money that helps police and health services fight overdose deaths. A 35% cut to the High‑Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program would take more than $100 million away, and changes to Medicaid could mean fewer people can get addiction treatment. With limited police forces and long distances, Alaska already struggles to stop fentanyl from arriving by mail. Police chiefs and activists are urging senators to block the cuts, fearing more deaths."
