title: "Castle Water offers £1bn more than rivals to help Thames Water"
summary: "Castle Water, led by CEO John Reynolds, says it would give Thames Water at least £1bn more than other bidders if it takes control. He says current plans fall short, especially on pollution problems. Thames Water carries £17bn of debt and is being steered by hedge‑fund lenders. Their plan could let pollution rules be broken for up to 15 years. Castle Water wants to invest in old sewage works and needs creditors to cut debt more to free cash."
