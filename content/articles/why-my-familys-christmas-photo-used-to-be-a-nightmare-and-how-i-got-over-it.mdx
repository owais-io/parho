title: "Why My Family’s Christmas Photo Used to Be a Nightmare — and How I Got Over It"
summary: "The yearly family Christmas photo used to be a painful, stressful event for me and my siblings. Every December my mother organized a big studio shoot with matching outfits, a camera, and a lot of pressure, making us cry and complain. Now that I’m a parent, I remember that fear but choose a relaxed, casual photo day. I keep it quick, use simple props, and laugh instead of forcing smiles. The lesson is that love, not perfection, matters."
