title: "Labour plans 60,000 new special‑needs places in schools"
summary: "The government will spend £3 billion to set up 60,000 new spots for children with special educational needs (SEND) in mainstream schools. The money will come partly from cancelling some planned free schools, saving about £600 million, and the rest from the 2024 budget. The plan is part of wider reforms that will be detailed in a new schools white paper next year, aiming to make local schools more inclusive and cut the huge number of SEND appeals."
