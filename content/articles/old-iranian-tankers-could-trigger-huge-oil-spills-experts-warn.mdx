title: "Old Iranian Tankers Could Trigger Huge Oil Spills, Experts Warn"
summary: "Decrepit Iranian tankers in a secret fleet are a ticking time bomb, say experts. Many are over 20 years old, some more than 30, and they often run without insurance or proper maintenance. If one sinks or explodes, it could spill far more oil than the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, harming sea life and coastlines. Analysts call for better tracking and stricter inspections, but no single country is taking the lead."
