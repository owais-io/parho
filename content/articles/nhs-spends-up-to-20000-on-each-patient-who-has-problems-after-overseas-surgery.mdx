title: "NHS spends up to £20,000 on each patient who has problems after overseas surgery"
summary: "The NHS is paying up to £20,000 for each patient who returns with serious problems after surgery abroad. A study found that half of overseas patients develop complications like infections or organ failure, and many need long stays, extra operations, and ICU care. The main reasons are cheap cosmetic and weight‑loss procedures in places like Turkey. The cost puts extra strain on NHS services."
