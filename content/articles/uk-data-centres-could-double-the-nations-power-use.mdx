title: "UK Data Centres Could Double the Nation’s Power Use"
summary: "Ofgem says that about 140 new data‑centre projects in the UK could need 50 GW of electricity, which is 5 GW more than the country’s biggest peak demand. That would double the total power needed. The extra demand could slow down green projects and make it harder to hit the 2030 carbon‑free target. Ofgem wants stricter money tests and possible fees to stop unready projects clogging the grid."
