title: "Women's Asian Cup prize money stays the same, despite players’ calls for a raise"
summary: "Australia will host the 2024 Women’s Asian Cup, but the prize money stays the same as in 2020—$1.8 million for the top four teams. Players and unions asked the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to raise it, citing the global rise in women’s football, but the AFC says the fund is tied to commercial revenue and will grow later. Critics say this keeps the tournament the lowest‑paying in the world and that fans and sponsors are already growing."
