title: "Al Carns: From Marine to Rising Labour Politician"
summary: "Al Carns is a Royal Marine who joined Labour and became an MP in 2024. He’s now the armed‑forces minister and has spoken loudly about the threat of war with Russia. Carns rose from a 24‑year‑old career in the military to a minister in the first year after the election. Some colleagues see him as a future party leader, but others doubt a military background guarantees political skill. He also set a world record climbing Everest in five days."
