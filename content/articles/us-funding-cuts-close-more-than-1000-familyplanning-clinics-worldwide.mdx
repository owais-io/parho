title: "US funding cuts close more than 1,000 family‑planning clinics worldwide"
summary: "A new survey shows that cuts to U.S. aid have shut down 1,394 family‑planning clinics, especially in Africa and the Middle East. The closures leave millions without access to contraceptives, abortion support, and care for sexual assault survivors. The loss of $43 million in funding has created job cuts, stock shortages, and a rise in unsafe abortions, threatening gains in gender equality."
