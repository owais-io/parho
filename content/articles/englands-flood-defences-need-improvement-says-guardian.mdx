title: "England's Flood Defences Need Improvement, Says Guardian"
summary: "Heavy rain is still flooding parts of south‑west England and Wales, and experts say the country’s flood defences are too weak. The Environment Agency is looking at a new flood‑management plan, but long‑term cuts to its budget mean it struggles to prepare for the storms. Climate change is making intense winter rain arrive earlier, putting millions of homes at risk and forcing ministers to step up drainage and other protection work."
