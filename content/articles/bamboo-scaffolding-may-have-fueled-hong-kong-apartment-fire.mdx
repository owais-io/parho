title: "Bamboo Scaffolding May Have Fueled Hong Kong Apartment Fire"
summary: "A deadly apartment fire in Hong Kong killed dozens, partly because the building was wrapped in bamboo scaffolding. The Wang Fuk Court complex has eight 31‑story towers, 2,000 flats, and about 4,800 residents. Police think the bamboo and green mesh let the blaze jump quickly between flats. Hong Kong is moving away from bamboo toward fire‑resistant steel, but some workers worry about losing jobs."
