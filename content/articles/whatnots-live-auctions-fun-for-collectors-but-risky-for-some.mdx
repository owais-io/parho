title: "Whatnot’s Live Auctions: Fun for Collectors but Risky for Some"
summary: "People are using Whatnot, a live‑auction app that mixes streaming shows and instant bidding, to chase rare Pokémon cards and other collectibles. The gamified format can feel like gambling, and some users say they lose track of how much they spend, leading to debt and mental‑health worries. Meanwhile, sellers and scalpers grab limited items in bulk, inflating prices and hurting families who want normal Christmas gifts. The company says it offers spending limits, but critics say more regulation is needed."
