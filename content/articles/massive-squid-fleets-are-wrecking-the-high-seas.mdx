title: "Massive squid fleets are wrecking the high seas"
summary: "In the South Atlantic, an unregulated zone called Mile 201 is being flooded by giant squid‑catching fleets, mainly from China. Argentine coast guards watch these ships, but can’t intervene once they cross their borders. The fishing rush has jumped 65% in five years, killing huge numbers of seals and harming other species that rely on squid. Workers face violence and debt bondage. The seafood reaches Europe and North America, so consumers may be buying food linked to abuse and environmental damage."
