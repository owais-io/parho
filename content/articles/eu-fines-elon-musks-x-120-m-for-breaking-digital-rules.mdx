title: "EU fines Elon Musk’s X €120 m for breaking digital rules"
summary: "The European Union hit Elon Musk’s social‑media platform X with a €120 million fine for violating the Digital Services Act. The court said X misused the blue‑check “verification” badge, hid who paid for ads, and stopped researchers from seeing public advertising data. The €120 million breaks into €45 m for the fake badge, €35 m for ad rules, and €40 m for data access. It’s the first big DSA hit and adds pressure on Musk and the U.S."
