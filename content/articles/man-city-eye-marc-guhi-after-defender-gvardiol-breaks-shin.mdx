summary: "Manchester City are looking to sign 25‑year‑old centre‑back Marc Guéhi from Crystal Palace after the club was left short of defenders when Josko Gvardiol broke his shin. Palace wants about £40m, a bit more than the £35m Liverpool offered last year. Gvardiol will have surgery and could miss months.
