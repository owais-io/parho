title: "UK Gas Supply Risk Report Hidden on Budget Day"
summary: "On budget day, a 50‑page report from the National Energy System Operator warned that Britain could run out of gas if its biggest pipe, the 725‑mile Langeled, were damaged. The danger could come from sabotage, not old bombs. While the government promised to act, fixing the pipe would take months, and other sources—Norwegian imports, LNG ships, interconnectors, and storage—are limited and expensive. The report was hidden that day, but the risk is real and growing."
