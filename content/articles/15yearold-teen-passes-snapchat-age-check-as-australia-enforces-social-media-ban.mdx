title: "15‑Year‑Old Teen Passes Snapchat Age Check as Australia Enforces Social Media Ban"
summary: "15‑year‑old Charlie in Sydney used Snapchat’s face‑age check to prove he was over 16 and kept his account, just before Australia’s new law bars under‑16s from social media. Snapchat warned it’s hard to stop teens, saying other tools could help. The ban, backed by the prime minister, lets parents flag accounts, but algorithms can still let some slip through. Other apps like Instagram, TikTok and Meta also follow the rule, but parents say they’re still unsure how to report kids."
