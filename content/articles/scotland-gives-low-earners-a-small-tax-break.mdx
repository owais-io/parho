title: "Scotland Gives Low Earners a Small Tax Break"
summary: "Scotland’s new budget gives people earning less than £33,500 a small tax break – about £11 a year – by raising the income‑tax thresholds. The move is meant to help the SNP win the upcoming election and ease the cost of living for 55% of Scots. The package adds money for children, hikes council tax on big houses and boosts college fees. Critics say the changes are political and ignore bigger problems like the NHS and housing."
