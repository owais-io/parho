summary: "Australian ministers held more than 20 meetings with executives from Japanese LNG companies, pushing for policies that keep the gas industry alive. The firms own over A$70 billion in Australian LNG projects, about 17 % of global capacity, and could produce 290 million tonnes of CO₂ each year. The meetings shaped the 2024 “Future Gas Strategy,” which promises gas until 2050, even though Australia and Japan say they want net‑zero emissions."
