title: "Starmer Wants to Cut European Human Rights – Critics Say It’s Harmful"
summary: "Keir Starmer has urged European leaders to trim the European Convention on Human Rights to tighten border controls. Critics argue this would hurt migrants, reduce freedoms, and give politicians no real ideas for tackling big problems like housing and inequality. They say protecting human rights is key, especially as Europe needs immigrant workers and good policies. The move is seen as a sign of a weak, unclear political direction."
