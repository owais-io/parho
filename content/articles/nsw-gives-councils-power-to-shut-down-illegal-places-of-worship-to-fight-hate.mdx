title: "NSW Gives Councils Power to Shut Down Illegal Places of Worship to Fight Hate"
summary: "The NSW government is giving local councils stronger powers to shut down unlawful places of worship after the Bondi beach shooting. New rules let councils close premises that lack proper approval, cut utilities, and impose fines up to $110,000 per person and $220,000 for companies. Councils must now consult police before approving any religious site. The move has sparked worries over freedom of religion, but the premier says it targets hate‑speaking “factories of hate”."
