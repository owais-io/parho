title: "Labour passes Welsh budget after deal with Plaid Cymru"
summary: "Labour's Cardiff Bay government has pushed through Wales’ 2026‑27 budget by making a deal with the pro‑independence Plaid Cymru. The budget raises spending by £1.2 billion, giving extra money to health, local councils, buses, apprenticeships and flood protection. Plaid voted to abstain, allowing Labour to claim the work. Critics say the deal is weak and won’t fix deeper problems, but Labour says it shows fairness and care for the NHS."
