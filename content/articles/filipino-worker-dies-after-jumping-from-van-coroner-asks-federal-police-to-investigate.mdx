title: "Filipino worker dies after jumping from van, coroner asks federal police to investigate"
summary: "A 21‑year‑old Filipino trainee named Jerwin Royupa died in March 2019 after jumping from a van driven by his training sponsor in New South Wales. The coroner found the worker was exploited: long hours, no pay, no passport and no real training. He was forced to work hard in the heat and the sponsor didn’t call an ambulance. The inquest now asks the federal police to look deeper and urges the Home Affairs department to tighten the 407 visa rules."
