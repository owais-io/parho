title: "BP hires new CEO, raising questions about timing"
summary: "BP has appointed Meg O'Neill, boss of Woodside Energy, as chief executive after Murray Auchincloss stepped down. The change is surprising because BP balances oil production with greener plans, while O'Neill is known for boosting shareholder value, not cutting costs. Investors are unsure if she will help BP grow or make it more profitable, especially as oil prices fall and the company carries heavy debt."
