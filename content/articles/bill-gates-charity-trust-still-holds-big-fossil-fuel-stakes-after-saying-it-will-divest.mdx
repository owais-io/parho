title: "Bill Gates’ Charity Trust Still Holds Big Fossil Fuel Stakes After Saying It Will Divest"
summary: "Bill Gates’ charity trust still holds a large stake in oil and gas companies, even after Gates said he’d move away from fossil fuels. In 2024 the trust invested $254 million in firms like Chevron, BP and Shell – the most it has ever put into such producers in nine years. Since 2015, the trust’s fossil‑fuel holdings have climbed again, driven by new stakes in Inpex and BP, meaning Gates’ pledge to ditch such stocks is still unfulfilled."
