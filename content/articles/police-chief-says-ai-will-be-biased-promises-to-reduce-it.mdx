title: "Police Chief Says AI Will Be Biased, Promises to Reduce It"
summary: "Police chief Alex Murray says AI tools used by police will be biased because they learn from past data. He says the new £115m national AI centre will clean the data, test the models, and train officers to recognise and reduce bias. The centre will also pick which private tech products work. Murray points to real‑world gains, such as fast evidence from phones and debunking deepfakes, but stresses that humans must make final decisions."
