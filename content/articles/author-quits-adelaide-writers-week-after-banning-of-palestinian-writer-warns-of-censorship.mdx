title: "Author quits Adelaide Writers’ Week after banning of Palestinian writer, warns of censorship"
summary: "I’m stepping down as director of Adelaide Writers’ Week because the board chose to drop Palestinian author Randa Abdel‑Fattah from the program. This shows a growing trend of political pressure silencing free speech in the arts. The decision fears controversy, lets lobbyists influence programming, and sets a precedent for future cancellations. I can’t support silencing writers, so I resign."
