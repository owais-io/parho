title: "Russia Finds Ways to Keep Shipping Cheap Oil to India Amid U.S. Sanctions"
summary: "Russia is working to bypass U.S. sanctions so it can keep selling cheap crude to India. India is now the world’s second‑largest buyer of Russian oil, still offered at big discounts. U.S. tariffs and sanctions on the two biggest Russian exporters have cut imports a bit, but new Russian sellers appear to skirt the rules. India’s big refineries and the private firm Reliance are still interested, hoping to keep low‑price fuel."
