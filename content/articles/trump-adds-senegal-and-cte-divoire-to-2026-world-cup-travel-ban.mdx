summary: "President Trump has added Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire to the U.S. travel ban for the 2026 World Cup. The ban is based on visa overstay rates—about 4% for Senegal and 8% for Côte d’Ivoire. Athletes and diplomats are exempt. The ban now covers 39 countries, including Haiti and Iran, which face stricter limits.
