title: "Protect the Chagos Islands’ Natural Habitat"
summary: "A letter urges that the Chagos Islands, one of the world’s last undisturbed tropical ecosystems, must stay protected when the UK hands them back to Mauritius. The writer notes that the islands’ value lies not just in species numbers but in how the ecosystem runs naturally. Plans for fishing and other exploitation could destroy this fragile environment, and the author warns that any future conservation claims would be empty if the islands are harmed."
