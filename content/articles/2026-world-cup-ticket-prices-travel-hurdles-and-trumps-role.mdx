title: "2026 World Cup: Ticket Prices, Travel Hurdles, and Trump’s Role"
summary: "Tickets for the 2026 World Cup in North America are pricey, with FIFA’s dynamic pricing pushing costs up to nine times the 2022 level. Only a tiny slice of seats stay at the $60 floor, and a 15% fee on FIFA’s resale platform cuts into fans. Travel adds hurdles: US visa rules, Trump‑era bans on four nations, and higher flight and hotel costs make trips tough. Fans fear missing games, and politics has turned the event into a talking point."
