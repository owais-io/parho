summary: "Electric cars are now common in both wealthy and poorer countries. In places like Norway, Denmark, California and the Netherlands, more than half of new cars are zero‑emission. A recent study shows 39 nations have at least 10% electric‑car sales, thanks especially to cheaper Chinese models. Even Turkey and Thailand are catching up, while countries like Ethiopia ban petrol cars. The challenge is building enough charging stations to keep up with the boom."
