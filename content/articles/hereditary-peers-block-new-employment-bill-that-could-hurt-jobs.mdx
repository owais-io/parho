title: "Hereditary peers block new employment bill that could hurt jobs"
summary: "Some hereditary members of the House of Lords have stopped Angela Rayner’s bill, which would raise the cost of hiring for businesses. Critics say the bill could scare companies and make it harder for young people to find work, especially as unemployment is already at 5%. The bill would cost firms about £5 billion a year. Business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses and the CBI back the Lords’ move, while many Labour peers voted against it."
