title: "Meghan Markle’s Netflix Show Misses the Top 1,000 and Won’t Return for a Third Season"
summary: "The second season of Meghan Markle’s “With Love, Meghan” didn’t crack Netflix’s top 1,000 shows, ranking 1,124th with about 2 million views between July and December. Critics panned the series as “contrived” and “baffling.” After filming in Montecito and pairing with guests like Tan France and Chrissy Teigen, the show was part of a $100 m deal that has struggled to draw audiences. No third season or new specials are planned, though Meghan’s brand will keep producing shorter videos."
