title: "German sitcom character Stromberg feels like new chancellor Merz"
summary: "German comedian Christoph Maria Herbst’s character Bernd Stromberg, a boss who thinks he’s great but is actually sexist and clueless, is being compared to new German chancellor Friedrich Merz. On social media, people dub Merz’s gaffes with Stromberg clips, and a new film about the show is coming out. The film and memes show how the old TV joke still fits today, even though Stromberg is a darker, more cynical comedy than the UK’s *The Office*."
