title: "ActionAid to Stop Child Sponsorships and Re‑shape How It Helps"
summary: "ActionAid’s new leaders say the charity’s child‑sponsorship program, where donors pick a child to support, is outdated and can feel patronising. They want to shift from a “sponsor a child” model to one that works with local communities and groups, giving donors money to fund projects instead of letters. The change will focus on solidarity, anti‑racism, and women’s rights, and will phase out the program by 2028."
