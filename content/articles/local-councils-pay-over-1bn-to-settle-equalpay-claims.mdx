title: "Local councils pay over £1bn to settle equal‑pay claims"
summary: "More than £1bn has been paid to women who worked in local councils for years being paid less than men. The GMB union has settled about 30,000 claims, averaging £30,000 each. A big win was Birmingham’s £250m settlement after a four‑year fight. Glasgow’s deal hit £770m. Still, 40,000 claims are pending and councils are under‑funded, so more money is expected next year."
