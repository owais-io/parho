title: "New Games Replay Millennial Growing‑Up Stories"
summary: "Video game makers are now creating stories that feel like memoirs of their own teenage years. In the early 2000s, before Instagram or smartphones, people chatted in forums and played on PCs. Titles like Despelote, Consume Me and Perfect Tides let players experience those days through characters who study, write, fight cravings or navigate first‑love awkwardness. These “autobiographical” games capture the lighter, less‑filtered side of millennial life and show how the first generation of gamers is reflecting on its own past."
