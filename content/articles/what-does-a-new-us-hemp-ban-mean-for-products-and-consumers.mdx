title: "What Does a New US Hemp Ban Mean for Products and Consumers?"
summary: "The Senate just added a ban on most hemp products, putting a 0.4‑mg THC limit on every package. The move was added last minute to a bill that reopened the government. Hemp makers warn the rule could stop many CBD drinks and other items, or let states keep their own rules. Some think Congress will later tweak the law, while others fear a full shutdown of the industry."
