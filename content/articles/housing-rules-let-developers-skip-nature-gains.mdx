title: "Housing Rules Let Developers Skip Nature Gains"
summary: "The UK government has relaxed a rule that once required developers to add extra nature space when building homes. Sites smaller than 0.2 hectares are now exempt, meaning a lot of land that could have been improved for wildlife won’t be. Nature groups say this weakens the promise to protect biodiversity, hurts private investment in habitats, and could make future large projects less green. Critics say the government is breaking its pledge to boost nature."
