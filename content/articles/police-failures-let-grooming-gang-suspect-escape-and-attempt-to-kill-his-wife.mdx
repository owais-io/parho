title: "Police Failures Let Grooming Gang Suspect Escape and Attempt to Kill His Wife"
summary: "An investigation revealed that police missed key evidence in a 2006 grooming gang case in Oldham, letting a suspect—later called Offender J—avoid charges. In 2009 he tried to murder his wife, an attempt the police had ignored. The original case involved a 12‑year‑old girl who was raped by five men, but little evidence linked J to the abuse. The case is now part of a national inquiry, and the victim still seeks justice and answers."
