title: "EU may force TikTok to change addictive design"
summary: "European regulators say TikTok’s design is too addictive and could hurt users, especially children. The Digital Services Act requires the app to stop features that keep people scrolling for hours, like endless feeds and lack of screen‑time limits. The EU could mandate changes to the algorithm, add night breaks, and improve parental controls. TikTok disputes the claim and plans to challenge the decision."
