title: "The word 'Populism' has lost its meaning"
summary: "Populism used to label the new left‑ and right‑wing parties that rose after 2010, but the word has become vague and pejorative. Now the right is winning in many countries, while the left struggles to rebuild. The term mainly captured the flashy slogans and soundbites politicians used, not their real plans. In government, left leaders aim for social democracy; right leaders push neo‑nationalism. Because the right can work inside or outside the system, it keeps winning. The word no longer explains the politics we see today."
