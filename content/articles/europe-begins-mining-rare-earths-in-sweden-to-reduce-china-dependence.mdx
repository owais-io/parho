title: "Europe Begins Mining Rare Earths in Sweden to Reduce China Dependence"
summary: "Sweden’s LKAB mine in Kiruna is now digging for rare‑earth metals, the minerals that power phones, electric cars and jet engines. The EU has no working rare‑earth mines, and most supply comes from China, which can restrict exports. LKAB is using deep tunnels and new tech to extract the metals slowly, hoping to give Europe a backup source. It could take years, but it’s a first step to less China‑dependency."
