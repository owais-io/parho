title: "Trump’s chaotic politics prove there’s no real “new world order”"
summary: "The piece argues that Trump’s foreign policy is messy and unpredictable. It says he makes bold claims about a “new world order” but his actions—like attacking Venezuela, pushing for gunboat diplomacy, and chasing money—don’t fit any clear plan. The writer points out that the US has a long history of interfering in other countries, and Trump just repeats old patterns in a chaotic way. His style causes confusion and undermines stability."
