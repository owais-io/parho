title: "Tory transport battles could make roads unsafe, minister says"
summary: "Minister Lilian Greenwood says the Conservative era of road policy that put drivers and cyclists in conflict made roads riskier. She says the new £600 m for cycling and walking plans are a step forward, but the previous government’s drive to favour motorists hurt safety and created mistrust. Greenwood wants a single system that works for everyone, with clear targets and long‑term funding to cut crashes and deaths."
