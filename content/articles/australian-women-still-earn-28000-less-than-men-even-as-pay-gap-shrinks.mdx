title: "Australian Women Still Earn $28,000 Less Than Men, Even as Pay Gap Shrinks"
summary: "Australia’s gender pay gap has slipped a bit in 2025, with women earning about 79 cents for every dollar men get. That still means they make roughly $28,000 less a year. The gap fell by 0.7 percentage points, thanks to more companies putting fairness policies in place. But the gap is wider at top jobs, and women hold only a fifth of CEO roles. Men are also taking more parental leave, showing a shift toward shared care."
