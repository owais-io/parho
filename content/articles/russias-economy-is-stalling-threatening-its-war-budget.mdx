title: "Russia’s Economy Is Stalling, Threatening Its War Budget"
summary: "Russia’s once‑booming economy has slowed to a crawl, largely because oil prices have fallen and the country’s heavy war spending is draining its coffers. Tax hikes and higher VAT are now hurting ordinary Russians, while the population shrinks and labour shortages grow. The government may keep funding the war for now, but the weak economy could weaken Russia’s position in Ukraine and spark talks for peace."
