title: "Anas Sarwar’s Break With Keir Starmer Could Revive Scottish Labour"
summary: "Scottish Labour is in crisis after the party’s spring conference, where a push to force Keir Starmer to resign sparked anger. Anas Sarwar, the party’s leader, is now taking a hard line against Starmer to show independence and focus on local issues like education and health. He hopes this move will win back voters before the Holyrood election, but polls suggest the SNP still dominates and Labour could finish third."
