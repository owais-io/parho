summary: "The Guardian apologises for a number of mistakes in recent pieces. It corrected the council that left a 91‑year‑old cancer patient in damp conditions (it was Wandsworth, not Southwark). It fixed the location of a Turner exhibition (National Galleries of Scotland, not the Royal Scottish Academy). Quiz answers were swapped (Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan). Other articles on topics from shark attacks to diabetes tech were also amended. Readers can send complaints to guardian.readers@theguardian.com."
