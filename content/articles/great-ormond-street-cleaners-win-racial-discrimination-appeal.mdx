title: "Great Ormond Street Cleaners Win Racial Discrimination Appeal"
summary: "In 2024, 80 cleaners at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, most of whom are from Black and minority ethnic groups, won a legal fight over unfair pay. The cleaners were moved from a private contractor to NHS employment but had to wait months before getting the same pay and benefits as NHS staff. An employment tribunal agreed they faced race discrimination, and the hospital now must offer them proper NHS terms."
