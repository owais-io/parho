title: "Give Every Child a Book, Even If They Don’t Read"
summary: "The article says we should give a book to every child, especially those who say they don't read. Instead of generic books, pick one that matches what the child loves—like a fishing story, a football biography, or a graphic novel. Pair the book with a related gift, read a chapter together, and set quiet reading time. Role‑model by reading with them, and you can even donate books to charities. It’s a simple way to spark a love of reading."
