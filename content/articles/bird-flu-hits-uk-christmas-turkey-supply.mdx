title: "Bird Flu Hits UK Christmas Turkey Supply"
summary: "Bird flu is hitting UK poultry farms harder than last winter, especially for free‑range and organic birds. Around 300,000 birds, or 5 % of the Christmas flock, have been culled so far. Big supermarkets are buying ahead at higher prices, so they can keep their shelves stocked, but smaller shops may need to raise prices. Farmers are tightening bio‑security, with new indoor‑housing rules for flocks over 50 birds. The next weeks will decide how many birds survive for Christmas."
