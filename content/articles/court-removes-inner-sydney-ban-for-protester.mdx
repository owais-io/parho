title: "Court Removes Inner Sydney Ban for Protester"
summary: "A Sydney court removed a ban that kept Palestinian‑Australian Eyad Shadid out of the city centre while he was on bail for protesting against Israeli President Isaac Herzog. The magistrate said the restriction was too harsh and not proportionate after a lawyer argued the police had no clear legal reason to stop him. Police feared he might commit another offence, but the judge said his other bail conditions would keep him safe and on track with court dates."
