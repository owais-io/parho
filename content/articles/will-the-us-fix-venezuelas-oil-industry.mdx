title: "Will the US Fix Venezuela’s Oil Industry?"
summary: "Trump says he will bring big US oil firms into Venezuela to fix its broken oil business. Venezuela has huge oil reserves, but corruption and bad infrastructure have cut output to about 1 million barrels a day. The U.S. companies that could invest—Exxon, Chevron, Conoco—haven’t yet committed. Even if they do, rebuilding takes years and billions. The move could affect Chinese imports and global oil prices, but any price change is likely slow."
