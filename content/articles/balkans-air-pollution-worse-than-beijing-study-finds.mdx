title: "Balkans Air Pollution Worse Than Beijing, Study Finds"
summary: "A Swiss research team drove a mobile lab around Sarajevo and found that winter particle pollution is the highest in Europe—often exceeding levels seen in Beijing. About 3,300 people die early each year in Bosnia and Herzegovina from this air quality. Most of the grime comes from home heating with wood, coal and garbage, plus old cars and restaurant cooking. Experts say better insulation, heat pumps and cleaner stoves are needed by 2033."
