title: "Colorado River Water Deal Stalls Among Seven Western States"
summary: "Seven western states failed to agree on how to cut water use from the Colorado River, leaving the basin in crisis. Negotiations ended a day before a federal deadline, with upper‑basin states saying lower‑basin states should shoulder the cuts. Rising drought, low reservoirs, and climate change make the river’s future uncertain. Without a deal, the government may force cuts that could spark lawsuits and threaten farms, cities and wildlife."
