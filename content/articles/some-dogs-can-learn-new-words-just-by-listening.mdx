title: "Some Dogs Can Learn New Words Just by Listening"
summary: "Scientists tested “gifted” dogs that can learn toy names by listening to owners, not being taught. In experiments, dogs were shown two new toys and later asked to fetch them by name. They got it right about 90 % when the name was spoken directly and 80 % when only overheard. Most normal dogs can’t do this. The study suggests listening to words taps into an older social skill, not just human language."
