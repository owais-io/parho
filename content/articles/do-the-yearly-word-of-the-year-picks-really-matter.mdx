title: "Do the yearly “word of the year” picks really matter?"
summary: "Every year different dictionaries pick a “word of the year” to highlight trends. This year’s choices include things like “rage bait,” “vibe coding,” and “parasocial.” Scholars say the picks are made more for buzz than deep research, and many words fall out of use quickly. Tech slang and internet buzz dominate recent selections. The whole exercise is more a marketing move to spark discussion than a lasting change in language."
