title: "Palau Senate Blocks Trump Deal to Resettle U.S. Deportees"
summary: "Palau's Senate has voted to block a Trump‑era agreement that would let up to 75 U.S. deportees move to the Pacific island. The deal, signed by President Whipps in December, would give the migrants work and housing while adding money for security. Traditional leaders and lawmakers say Palau is too small to take on the responsibility and fear it could harm cultural cohesion. The president says each person will be screened, but the Senate wants a public vote."
