title: "Streeting May Soon Challenge Starmer, Allies Say"
summary: "Allies of Labour Wes Streeting say he could try to unseat Prime Minister Keir Starmer within weeks, even though Streeting says he backs Starmer. Starmer faced a day, losing his communications chief and being criticised by Scottish leader Anas Sarwar. Despite a display of unity from some cabinet members and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, some MPs believe Streeting wants to challenge Starmer after upcoming elections. The outcome will depend on the Gorton and Denton by‑elections and May local polls."
