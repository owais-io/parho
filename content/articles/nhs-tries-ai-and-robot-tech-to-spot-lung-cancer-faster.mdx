title: "NHS Tries AI and Robot Tech to Spot Lung Cancer Faster"
summary: "NHS England is testing new AI software and robot‑guided biopsies at a London hospital to find lung cancer early. The AI looks at scans and flags tiny lumps, while a robotic camera helps doctors take a precise tissue sample. If it works, patients could get a quick, accurate diagnosis in half an hour instead of months of repeated scans, improving survival chances and reducing wait times."
