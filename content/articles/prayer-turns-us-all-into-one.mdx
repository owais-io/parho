title: "Prayer Turns Us All Into One"
summary: "Last year, I visited Westminster Abbey for Evensong and was struck by its beauty and the many prayers said there. It made me think about what prayer really means. I read C.S. Lewis, who said prayer is like a timeless conversation with God. This idea shows how prayer can unite people across religions and times, turning individual moments into a shared spiritual bond. It reminds us that prayer is a bridge that brings us closer together, no matter our background."
