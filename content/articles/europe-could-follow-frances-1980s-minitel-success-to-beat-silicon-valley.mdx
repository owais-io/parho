title: "Europe Could Follow France’s 1980s Minitel Success to Beat Silicon Valley"
summary: "France had big tech wins in the 1960s‑80s – space missions, the Concorde, and the Minitel, a state‑backed online service that let people buy tickets and chat before the internet. The Minitel grew fast but was limited by tight state control, a pattern similar to today’s big‑tech dominance. The article argues Europe can learn from France’s example, build its own tech, stay independent from Silicon Valley, and keep democracy at the center."
