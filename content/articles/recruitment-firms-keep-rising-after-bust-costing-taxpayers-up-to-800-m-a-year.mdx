title: "Recruitment firms keep rising after bust, costing taxpayers up to £800 m a year"
summary: "Recruitment companies that go bust can be bought back by the same people who ran them, a process called “phoenixing”. The new company comes in with no old debts, so the UK tax office loses money. HMRC estimates this costs taxpayers about £800 million each year. Recent cases show owners buying back companies for small amounts, leaving huge tax bills unpaid. Experts worry this unfair practice lets firms repeat the cycle and hurt competition."
