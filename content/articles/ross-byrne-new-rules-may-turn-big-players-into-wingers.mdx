summary: "Ross Byrne, a Gloucester fly‑half and Ireland international, worries that World Rugby’s new rule against escort defenders is making teams kick more and rely on big, fast players who chase kicks.

Byrne also criticises the long club‑season breaks for internationals, and hopes Gloucester can bounce back against Munster."
