title: "Cancer Caregivers Face Hidden Challenges"
summary: "Even though more people survive cancer, the people who look after them are often left out of the conversation. In the UK, about 1.1 million working adults help a family member with cancer, and they can suffer stress, health problems and even money‑related discrimination. New research calls for a rule that after five years you don’t have to tell banks you had cancer, and it urges better support for carers and teen helpers."
