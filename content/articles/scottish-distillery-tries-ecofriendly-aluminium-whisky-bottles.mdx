title: "Scottish Distillery Tries Eco‑Friendly Aluminium Whisky Bottles"
summary: "Stirling Distillery, a tiny Scottish producer, is testing aluminium bottles for its whisky to cut carbon and shipping weight. Aluminium is lighter than glass, easier to recycle, and could appeal to younger buyers who care about sustainability. Scientists found some aluminium leached into the drink, raising safety concerns, so better bottle linings are needed. The trial will see if whisky lovers will accept the new, greener packaging."
