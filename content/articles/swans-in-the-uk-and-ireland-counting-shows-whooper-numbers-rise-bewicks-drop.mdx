title: "Swans in the UK and Ireland: Counting Shows Whooper Numbers Rise, Bewick’s Drop"
summary: "Volunteer birders will take part in the six‑yearly census to count two wintering swan species—whoopers from Iceland and Bewick’s from Siberia—across the UK and Ireland. The survey finds whooper swans have nearly doubled to about 20,000, while Bewick’s have fallen to just around 700. Warmer winters improve survival for whoopers but discourage Bewick’s from crossing the North Sea."
