title: "UK will push to stop unfair lawsuits that silence whistleblowers"
summary: "David Lammy said the UK government will do more to fight “Slapps” – lawsuits that try to silence whistleblowers and journalists. The Justice Ministry will first use the 2023 Economic Crime Act and then look at new laws, aiming for a final plan by 2029. Politicians and campaigners want quicker action, but the new policy also adds more money for anti‑corruption police and a review of stolen assets."
