title: "Strict border rules boost human smuggling, study says"
summary: "A new report shows that tougher migration rules in many countries are actually helping smugglers. Researchers interviewed over 80,000 migrants and 458 smugglers. They found that tighter borders make people more likely to use smugglers, who raise their prices because the risk is higher. Most migrants say they choose smuggling because legal routes are closed, not because smugglers convinced them."
