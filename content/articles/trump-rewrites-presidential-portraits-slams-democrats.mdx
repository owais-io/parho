title: "Trump Rewrites Presidential Portraits, Slams Democrats"
summary: "Trump has added new, opinion‑heavy plaques to the White House’s Presidential Walk of Fame, calling Biden the worst president and blasting Obama and Clinton. The plaques now read like Trump’s tweets, with praise for Reagan and criticism for others. Biden’s portrait was even removed and replaced by an autopen image. The move comes as Trump’s approval dips and the U.S. faces a healthcare crisis. It shows how he’s reshaping the White House to match his own narrative."
