title: "Polish resentment toward Ukrainians is on the rise"
summary: "A man in Szczecin attacked a Ukrainian couple after asking them to speak Polish, showing how hostile attitudes are growing. Surveys show that support for Ukrainian refugees has dropped sharply, and new right‑wing leaders have pushed stricter rules. Many Ukrainians report verbal abuse, while some still feel welcomed in larger cities. The change is linked to political shifts, online hate, and old historic grudges."
