title: "Labour Leader Sarwar Says He Acted Alone in Urging Starmer to Quit"
summary: "Downing Street is confident that Anas Sarwar’s call for Keir Starmer to step down was a solo move, not part of a wider plot by other Labour ministers. While other MPs had hinted at a challenge, no evidence shows a coordinated effort. The move comes just before Scottish elections, raising doubts about Labour’s standing in Scotland. No 10 is now working to calm tensions and keep the party united."
