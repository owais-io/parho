title: "Protests Are Really Effective, Historians Say"
summary: "Protests have changed U.S. politics and culture. Historians say they can win laws, boost elections, and build community. The 2017 Women’s March, Black Lives Matter and other protests pushed more women into politics and helped Democrats win votes. Studies show that even 3.5% of a population can topple a regime if the protest is peaceful. Non‑violent tactics win public sympathy. Protesters also feel hopeful and stay active in future causes."
