title: "Study Finds Most Statin Side‑Effects Aren’t Caused by the Drugs"
summary: "A big review of 19 trials with 124,000 people found that out of the 66 side‑effects listed on statin labels, only four have solid evidence linking them to the drugs. The rest, like memory loss or depression, are not caused by statins. The risks that do exist, such as muscle pain and diabetes, are small. Overall, statins still offer more heart‑protective benefits than harms, so doctors should update warnings to match the evidence."
