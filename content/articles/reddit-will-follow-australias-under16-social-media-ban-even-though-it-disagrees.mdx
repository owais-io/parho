title: "Reddit Will Follow Australia’s Under‑16 Social Media Ban, Even Though It Disagrees"
summary: "Reddit said it will obey Australia’s new rule that stops people under 16 from using the site. The company calls the law “legally erroneous” and says Reddit is mainly an information forum, not a social network. From next week, new Australians must enter their birth date, and existing users will be checked by an age‑prediction tool. If the tool thinks someone is under 16, they can appeal and prove they’re old enough."
