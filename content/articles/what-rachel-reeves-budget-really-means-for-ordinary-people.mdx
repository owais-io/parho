title: "What Rachel Reeves' Budget Really Means for Ordinary People"
summary: "Rachel Reeves, the new Labour chancellor, was accused of lying about why taxes would rise in her budget. Investigations show she didn’t make false statements, but she did give a misleading explanation. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the UK’s economy is weaker than Reeves said, so taxes need to rise. In reality, most of the extra money will be used to shore up the Treasury, not to pay more for benefits. It benefits investors and the bond market."
