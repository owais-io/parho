summary: "Around 15,000 nurses in New York City’s biggest hospitals plan to strike on Monday, the city’s largest nurses walkout ever. The strike comes during a hard flu season and after a 2023 dispute that forced patients to be moved and ambulances to reroute. Hospital leaders say they’ve added temporary nurses, but the nurses want better staffing, lower workloads and safety measures. The governor warned a strike could endanger patients and urged both sides to negotiate."
