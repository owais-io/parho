title: "UK worries about US takeover of ITV hurting local media"
summary: "Comcast is looking to buy ITV, raising fears that US control could weaken Britain’s public‑service TV and news. The deal would give Comcast a big stake in ITN, the news arm for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, and could push Sky and ITV into a near‑monopoly of TV advertising. Regulators will examine the move, but many worry it could reduce the diversity and independence of UK media."
