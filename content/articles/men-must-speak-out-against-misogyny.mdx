title: "Men Must Speak Out Against Misogyny"
summary: "King Charles recently said he would back police investigations into alleged abuse, a step many welcome but hoped for sooner. The letter argues that misogyny isn’t limited to a few powerful men; it shows up in homes, clubs, and even the police. It calls on ordinary men to stop staying silent. When a normal man ignores abuse, he helps it continue. Men must step up, support victims, and speak out."
