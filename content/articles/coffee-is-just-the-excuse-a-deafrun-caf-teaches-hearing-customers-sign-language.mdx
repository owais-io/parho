title: "Coffee is Just the Excuse: A Deaf‑Run Café Teaches Hearing Customers Sign Language"
summary: "At a café run by deaf staff in London, hearing customers can order coffee using British Sign Language (BSL). The barista shows short videos of each menu item in BSL on a touchscreen, making the language accessible. The idea sparked interest in BSL for hearing people and shows how simple tech can help. Meanwhile, new AI tools are trying to translate sign language, but experts warn they’re still imperfect and could cause harm."
