title: "Stormy Winds Shape a Pine Forest: A Walk Through Fallen Trees"
summary: "After the summer colors faded, I walked through a pine forest hit by Storm Amy. Many trees were knocked down, creating gaps where new saplings can grow. Fallen trees become homes for beetles, fungi, and birds, and their roots make small pools that attract frogs and dragonflies. The wind lets more light in, letting birches and rowans take root. I saw how a storm reshapes the forest."
