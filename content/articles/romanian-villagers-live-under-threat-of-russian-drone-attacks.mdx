title: "Romanian villagers live under threat of Russian drone attacks"
summary: "On Romania’s Danube border, the small village of Plauru is quietly caught in the Ukraine war. Every night, Russian drones fly over the river, sometimes dropping debris that hits houses and crops. Residents—about 500 people in the commune—are forced to evacuate when drones hit nearby Ukrainian ships, and they fear another strike could destroy their homes. Poor roads and lack of basic services make escaping hard, and the constant fear is hurting families, especially children."
