summary: "Donna DesRuisseaux, a 62‑year‑old mom from New Hampshire, started protesting on bridges to support democracy. Her story shows how groups like Indivisible and NorCal Resist are inviting people who never thought of themselves as activists. They use pop‑culture ads, humor, and community events to break down barriers and build solidarity. Researchers say that if 3.5 % of the population joins, change is likely. The current protest wave shows more people fighting for rights, science, and the environment."
