title: "DeepMind AI Helps Spot Genetic Causes of Disease"
summary: "DeepMind has launched AlphaGenome, an AI that predicts how DNA mutations change gene activity. By looking at millions of DNA letters, it can spot which changes might cause diseases like heart problems, cancer, or mental health disorders. Researchers are already using it to find new genetic drivers and could design targeted gene therapies in the future. This could speed up the development of new treatments and help doctors understand patient risks better."
