title: "Trump’s tariffs miss modern reality"
summary: "Trump’s new tariffs rely on a 1970s mindset that no longer fits today’s global, financialised world. The Supreme Court shut them down, and Trump tried a new 10% tariff under an old law, but the U.S. economy is far more interlinked. The article warns that losing leadership in manufacturing and tech supply chains could erode U.S. power, even though its currency stays strong. It cites Sri Lanka’s debt crisis to show the risks of economic mismanagement."
