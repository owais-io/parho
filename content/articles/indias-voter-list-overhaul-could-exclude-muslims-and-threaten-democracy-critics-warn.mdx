title: "India’s voter list overhaul could exclude Muslims and threaten democracy, critics warn"
summary: "India’s government is re‑listing voters in nine states and three territories. Opponents say the new survey, called SIR, is a hidden citizenship test that will remove many Muslims and poor people from the roll, giving the ruling BJP an advantage. Parliament heatedly debated it, with leaders accusing the process of “vote theft.” Critics point to Bihar’s 6.5 million removals and a West Bengal suicide as evidence of fear and injustice. The BJP insists it’s just cleaning the list."
