title: "US Fungal Library at Risk of Closing Because of Funding Cuts"
summary: "INVAM, the world’s biggest living library of soil fungi, could shut down in a year if it doesn’t get new federal money. The collection holds over 900 strains that help 70% of plants grow, fight drought, and store carbon. Scientists need it to study fungi and use them for restoring damaged land and reducing fertilizer use. Many commercial “biofertilizers” are poor quality, so the real science comes from INVAM. Losing it would hurt research, agriculture, and the environment."
