title: "High Court Overturns Palestine Action Ban"
summary: "High court judges ruled that banning Palestine Action was unlawful, saying it unfairly hit free speech and broke the government’s own rules. The ban isn’t gone yet— the Home Secretary may appeal and the group’s supporters could still face charges until the order is overturned. Police will stop arrests for showing support, but evidence will still be collected. The decision means the organisation could operate again if the appeal fails."
