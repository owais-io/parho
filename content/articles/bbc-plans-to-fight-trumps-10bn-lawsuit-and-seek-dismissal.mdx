title: "BBC plans to fight Trump’s $10bn lawsuit and seek dismissal"
summary: "Donald Trump has sued the BBC for $10 billion, saying a Panorama documentary defamed him. The BBC says the case has no merit and it didn’t even have the right to air the episode in the U.S. It will argue the show couldn’t have harmed Trump’s reputation because he won the election and most U.S. viewers couldn’t see it. BBC lawyers and board are preparing a defense and want to avoid a costly settlement."
