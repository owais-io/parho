title: "Will COP30 Start Cutting Fossil Fuels?"
summary: "COP30 in Brazil may not have a formal agenda item on cutting fossil fuels, but many countries want it discussed. In 2023, COP28 pledged to move away from fossil fuels, yet oil‑rich nations like Saudi Arabia resisted and the pledge was ignored at COP29. At COP30, groups such as Colombia push for a declaration and a roadmap, but no binding plan is expected now. The meeting could start a forum that might lead to a clearer roadmap later."
