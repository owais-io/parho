title: "NHS Staff Face Rising Abuse – Better Protection Needed"
summary: "More NHS workers are being hit, shouted at, filmed, and abused on social media. The problem is getting worse, but there is no quick fix. Experts say we need better training for de‑escalation, a national system that can exclude repeat offenders, and stronger laws that cover online hate. Sexual harassment is also a big issue – staff fear reporting, so a national anonymous reporting tool is urgently needed."
