title: "McDonald’s burgers are 100% real beef – no fillers or additives"
summary: "A common rumor says McDonald’s burgers are made with fake fillers, but the truth is simpler. McDonald’s uses only 100 % British or Irish beef, chosen from the forequarter and flank. The meat is ground, chilled and formed into patties, then cooked on a double‑sided grill. After cooking, a light sprinkle of salt and pepper is added. No binders, preservatives or extra flavouring – just plain beef."
