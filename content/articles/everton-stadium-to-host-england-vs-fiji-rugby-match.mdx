title: "Everton Stadium to Host England vs Fiji Rugby Match"
summary: "Everton’s new 53,000‑seat stadium could host England’s rugby match against Fiji, a neutral venue chosen to boost revenue and avoid using Twickenham. World Rugby and the Six Nations approved the switch, as other English stadiums are booked in July. It would be England’s first game outside Twickenham since 2019. The decision also helps the smaller Fiji union, which has limited home options."
