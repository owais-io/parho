title: "Why the NHS Doesn’t Give Patients an Easy Number to Call"
summary: "Adrian Chiles recounts how his NHS skin cancer case became a mess of confusing letters, apps and no real contact. A dermatologist warned he might have carcinoma, but appointments were delayed and communication was vague. He had to chase letters, use different passwords, and talk to a phone‑screened admin instead of a doctor. The tumour turned out to be a harmless squamous cell carcinoma, but the lack of a clear line to speak to left him frustrated."
