title: "Trump’s push for Greenland could spark a crisis – why we need calm diplomacy"
summary: "Trump says Russia and China want Greenland and wants Denmark to hand it over. His claim is unfounded, but it’s making NATO allies nervous. Countries have sent military observers, and some even consider moving troops. The piece argues that this drama could split NATO, lead to a new crisis, and spark an unnecessary conflict. It urges calm, slow diplomacy instead of a rush to war, especially with elections and a 25th‑amendment risk in mind."
