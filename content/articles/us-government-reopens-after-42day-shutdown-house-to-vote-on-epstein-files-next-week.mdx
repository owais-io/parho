title: "US government reopens after 42‑day shutdown; House to vote on Epstein files next week"
summary: "The U.S. government finally shut down after 42 days, ending the longest closure in history. A deal backed by most Republicans and a few Democrats let federal operations restart, but it left out the health‑insurance subsidies that Democrats had demanded. President Trump signed the bill. Now the House will hold a vote next week on releasing files about Jeffrey Epstein. The shutdown also caused travel and food‑aid disruptions, and some senators fought over the deal."
