title: "UK’s defence talks with EU stall"
summary: "Britain and the European Union are still struggling to agree on defence cooperation after Brexit. The UK’s leader, Sir Keir Starmer, says Europe needs stronger security ties, but talks over how much the UK will pay for the €140 bn EU security fund have stalled. He also promises to raise defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, but has not yet made concrete plans or clear budgets. The result is a gap between speeches and action, leaving the UK’s security future uncertain."
