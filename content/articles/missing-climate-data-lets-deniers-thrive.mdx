title: "Missing Climate Data Lets Deniers Thrive"
summary: "Monbiot argues that big gaps in climate data let denial flourish. A study claiming most people die of cold instead of heat turns out to rely on limited, high‑income country data, ignoring many hot, low‑income regions. Africa, for example, has very few weather stations, so heat‑related deaths are massively underreported. The result is a distorted view of climate risks and a weak basis for compensation or action. Rich nations offer little money for loss, reflecting their indifference."
