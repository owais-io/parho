title: "High exam stress at 15 raises risk of depression later in life"
summary: "A study of nearly 5,000 young people found that students who feel a lot of exam pressure at 15 are more likely to become depressed or self‑harmful into their twenties. Each extra point of stress raises the risk of depression by 25 % and self‑harm by 8 %. Researchers say schools should reduce high‑stakes tests and teach coping skills, while families should encourage sleep, play and exercise. The government plans to add more mental‑health staff to schools."
