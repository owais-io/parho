title: "Europeans Think Most Immigrants Are Illegal, but the Numbers Say Otherwise"
summary: "Across Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Poland, a YouGov poll shows most people think more migrants are living illegally than legally, even though studies show undocumented numbers are small. Nearly half want to stop new arrivals, and many support deporting rule‑breakers and benefit‑seekers. Views on legal migrants are split: some think they’re good, others say they don’t fit in. The results reveal a gap between perception and reality, plus concerns about identity and integration."
