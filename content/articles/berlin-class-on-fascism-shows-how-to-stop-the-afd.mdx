title: "Berlin class on fascism shows how to stop the AfD"
summary: "In 2025, the writer studied fascism at a Berlin seminar and linked the lessons to today’s right‑wing party, the AfD. She explains that defining fascism—racial purity, paramilitary force, anti‑liberal attitudes, wealthy backing—helps build resistance. The AfD lacks a paramilitary wing but scores on the other marks and has 20‑30% support. The article urges solidarity with migrants, public protests, and keeping a political firewall to prevent the AfD’s rise."
