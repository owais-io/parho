title: "Hong Kong Court Reverses Fraud Charges Against Jimmy Lai"
summary: "A Hong Kong appellate court on Thursday overturned fraud convictions against Jimmy Lai, a 78‑year‑old pro‑democracy activist and former Apple Daily owner. Lai still faces a 20‑year national‑security sentence, but the fraud case was dismissed because the prosecution couldn't prove the claims. The ruling may cut his overall time in prison, but he remains behind bars. International leaders, including the UK and US, have called for his release."
