summary: "Former UK Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi joined the Reform party, sparking a backlash among its vaccine‑skeptical members. They accused him of backing a doctor who said Covid shots caused the royal family’s cancers and worried the party was turning into a Muslim‑led, anti‑vaccine group. Zahawi said he supports the vaccination programme and will work with the party to base health policy on evidence. The move split the party and caused some members to quit."
