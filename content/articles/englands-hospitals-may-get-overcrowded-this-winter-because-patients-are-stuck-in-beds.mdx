title: "England’s hospitals may get overcrowded this winter because patients are stuck in beds"
summary: "This winter, England’s hospitals may get crowded because more patients are stuck in beds than last year. Delayed discharges mean beds stay full even when people are ready to leave. The result: long ambulance waits, patients in emergency rooms for hours, and higher risk of illness and death. Doctors are striking, adding pressure. Costs hit the NHS hard, and the government is trying to help with extra funding and better planning."
