title: "Claudette Colvin: The Hidden Hero of the Bus Boycott"
summary: "Claudette Colvin was a 15‑year‑old girl in Montgomery who refused to give up her bus seat in March 1955. She was arrested, but her protest was ignored by leaders who wanted a more “acceptable” figure, so Rosa Parks got the spotlight. Decades later Colvin’s story surfaced in newspapers, showing that ordinary people make history, that memory is uneven, that resistance is a group effort, and that the fight is still ongoing."
