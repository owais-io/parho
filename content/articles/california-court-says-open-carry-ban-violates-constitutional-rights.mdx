title: "California Court Says Open Carry Ban Violates Constitutional Rights"
summary: "An appeals court in San Francisco ruled that California’s rule banning people from openly carrying guns in most counties is unconstitutional. The 2‑to‑1 decision said the ban, which covers areas with more than 200,000 residents, violates the Second Amendment. The ruling cites the Supreme Court’s 2022 Bruen decision, which says gun laws must fit the nation’s historical tradition. The court also looked at California’s past open‑carry history and found the ban lacks that historic basis."
