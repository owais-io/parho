summary: "In Guinea, former army colonel Mamady Doumbouya seized power in 2021 and promised a transition to civilian rule. A new constitution now lets him run in the first election since the coup, making him the front‑runner. Opponents call his move a betrayal, citing his crackdown on critics and a pardon for a past dictator.
