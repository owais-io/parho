title: "Gen X Now Holds More Home Wealth Than Baby Boomers in Australia"
summary: "In Australia, Gen X families—people born 1965‑1980—now own more property than the baby boomers, according to KPMG research. They average $1.46 million in home wealth, beating boomers' $1.36 million. Baby boomers stay overall wealthier because of big super savings and less debt. Millennials own fewer homes and have less wealth, risking long‑term gaps. The study says buying a house early matters, and small extra costs can help young buyers."
