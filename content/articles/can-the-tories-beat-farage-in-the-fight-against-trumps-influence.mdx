title: "Can the Tories beat Farage in the fight against Trump’s influence?"
summary: "UK politics are in a tug‑of‑war. The mainstream Conservative Party, led by Kemi Badenoch, wants to keep the government honest while focusing on the economy. Nigel Farage’s Reform UK pushes hard for zero‑immigration and tries to win votes from former Conservative voters. Trump’s policy, which wants to split Europe into U.S. and Russian blocs, encourages far‑right groups. The article says the Conservatives may win on tax cuts and spending restraint, but they fear the rise of extreme nationalism."
