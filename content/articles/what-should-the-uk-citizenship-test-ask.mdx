title: "What Should the UK Citizenship Test Ask?"
summary: "Refugees I volunteer with often fail the UK citizenship test on silly questions that everyday Britons struggle with, like Hadrian’s Wall. I argue the test should focus on practical, everyday knowledge—how to legally ride electric scooters, what the living wage is, how to get a library card, when it's safe to cross the road, what a food bank is, and which political party is in power. These useful facts help newcomers adapt to life in the UK."
