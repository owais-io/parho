But independent brewers are stepping in, making their own nitro‑stouts that taste different and often richer than the Irish classic. Brands like London Black, Titanic’s True Stout, and other local craft brews are gaining fans and taking a bite out of Guinness’s market share. With 80% of indie makers now brewing stouts, the craft scene is growing fast."
