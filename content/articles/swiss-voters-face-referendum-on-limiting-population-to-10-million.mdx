title: "Swiss voters face referendum on limiting population to 10 million"
summary: "Swiss voters will decide on a June 10 referendum proposed by the far‑right Swiss People’s Party. The plan would stop the population from exceeding 10 million by blocking new arrivals, including asylum seekers and family members of foreigners. If the limit is reached, Switzerland could leave its free‑movement deal with the EU, hurting trade and jobs. While 48% back the move, major companies and the government warn it could damage the economy."
