title: "UK organic food sales surge despite higher prices"
summary: "UK organic food sales jumped 8% in 2025, driven by higher demand for meat, fish and staples. Middle‑income families are buying more, while big retailers are boosting their own‑brand ranges. Though organic items are pricier, promotions and Gen Z enthusiasm keep prices competitive. After a slump during the 2009 crisis, the market is now growing faster than the overall grocery sector. This growth shows that health concerns and trust in food sources keep consumers returning, even as cost of living worries remain."
