title: "Paramount plans to put new directors on Warner Bros board to block Netflix deal"
summary: "Paramount Skydance is trying to stop Warner Bros Discovery's deal with Netflix by nominating its own directors for the board. It also sued for more financial details so investors can judge the offers. The plan would let Paramount, backed by Oracle’s Larry Ellison, buy WBD for $108.4 bn and keep all its studios, while Netflix’s deal would give the giant control of Warner’s movies and shows. Paramount says its higher cash offer and inclusion of global networks is better for shareholders."
