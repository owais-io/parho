title: "Bangladesh Seeks Interpol Notice to Arrest UK MP Tulip Siddiq Over Land Corruption"
summary: "Bangladesh court orders an Interpol red notice to arrest UK Labour MP Tulip Siddiq over alleged land corruption. The case claims she used her aunt, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s, influence to hand state land to a private firm. Siddiq denies wrongdoing, calls evidence forged, and notes the UK lacks an extradition treaty with Bangladesh. British lawyers say the trial lacked basic rights and was unfair. A red notice is mainly symbolic and may not lead to arrest."
