title: "What NATO Is and How It Works"
summary: "NATO was created at the start of the Cold War to keep its members safe from the Soviet Union. Its main idea is that if one member is attacked, all of them help. That rule, Article 5, has only been used once, after the 9/11 attacks. Since then, 32 countries – from the US and UK to Finland and Sweden – have joined. NATO has sent forces to wars in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and now Ukraine, and member nations have agreed to raise defence budgets. They also work to keep borders safe, support peacekeeping missions, and help members meet defence spending targets."
