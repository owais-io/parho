title: "My Final Column: The Climate Crisis Is Clear"
summary: "I’m writing my last column to share the plain facts about climate change. Back in 1995, the first UN climate meeting saw CO2 at about 360 parts per million. Now it’s over 426, past the “safe” 350 mark, so scientists warn we’re heading toward disaster. I’ve been talking about this for years, and editors always told me to stay hopeful. But the numbers are hard to ignore."

Now it’s over 426, past the “safe” 350 mark, so scientists warn we’re heading toward disaster. I’ve been talking about this for years, and editors always told me to stay hopeful. But the numbers are hard to ignore.
