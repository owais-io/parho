title: "Inheritance Tax Change Gives Small Cumbrian Farms Major Relief"
summary: "A farmer from Cumbria attended a conference where a tax bill was shown that could cost £59,000 a year for a small hill farm. He feared the farm might have to sell. On December 23 the government raised the tax threshold from £1 million to £2.5 million, meaning many small farms are now protected. The change lets families keep their land and continue caring for wildlife, stopping farms from being sold for holiday lets or other commercial uses."
