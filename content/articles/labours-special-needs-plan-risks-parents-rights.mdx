title: "Labour's Special Needs Plan Risks Parents' Rights"
summary: "Labour wants to move children with special educational needs (SEND) into normal schools and spend £1.6bn over three years on early help and more support staff. The plan aims to make schools kinder and stop more kids going to specialist schools. But teachers worry about extra work and not enough training money. Parents fear that new rules will shrink the rights they have now, especially the legal EHCP system."
