title: "Did 2025 end Britain’s traditional parliamentary democracy?"
summary: "In 2025, Britain’s politics looked very different. The usual two‑party battle between Labour and the Tories has blurred, with Reform UK gaining big support and even the Tories moving closer to them. Trust in MPs and the government is at record lows, and voters feel angry and confused. Some think a new coalition or proportional‑representation system might replace the old Westminster style, but the next election could still swing back to the old pattern."
