title: "Ukraine peace talks stall again because of Putin"
summary: "U.S. advisers Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner tried to broker a deal in Moscow, but Putin held firm on territory and political control. The talks ended with no progress, as Russia said it would keep fighting until its demands were met. Washington had been pressuring Ukraine, not the Kremlin, and the meeting showed the deal is still blocked by Putin’s insistence."
