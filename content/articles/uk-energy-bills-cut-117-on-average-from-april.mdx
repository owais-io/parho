title: "UK Energy Bills Cut £117 on Average from April"
summary: "From April, the average UK household will pay £1,641 for gas and electricity – a 7% drop to £1,641 from £1,758 – thanks to a new price cap set by Ofgem. The chancellor’s promise to shave £150 off bills was partly offset by higher network costs. Prices remain about a third above pre‑Ukraine levels, so many families still struggle, even with the reduction."
