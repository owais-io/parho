title: "Ex‑Owner Buys Bankrupt Recruitment Firm and Promises Las Vegas Trip for Staff"
summary: "Premier Group Recruitment collapsed in September, owing £3 million, including £650,000 to HM Revenue and Customs. Its former shareholder, Andrew Woosnam, bought the assets for just £10,000, creating a new company that is debt‑free. He announced that staff could win an all‑expenses‑paid trip to Las Vegas for hitting sales targets. The move is a classic “phoenix” takeover, letting the business restart without its old debts."
