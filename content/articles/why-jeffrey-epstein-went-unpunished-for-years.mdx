title: "Why Jeffrey Epstein Went Unpunished for Years"
summary: "For nearly twenty years, police and the FBI heard about Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of girls, but they didn’t stop him. New documents show that local agencies didn’t share info and prosecutors were afraid to take a hard case. A cheap plea deal in Florida let him dodge federal charges, and he kept moving around. Only in 2019 did he get arrested, and he killed himself in jail. Victims say the system let him slip through the cracks."
