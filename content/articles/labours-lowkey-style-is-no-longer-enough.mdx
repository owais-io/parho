title: "Labour’s Low‑Key Style Is No Longer Enough"
summary: "Labour’s long‑running strategy of keeping politics low‑key and moderate—called “minimalism”—has helped it win elections but now feels out of touch. Under Keir Starmer, the party has tried to stay calm and avoid bold promises, while voters expect bigger solutions to problems like inequality, climate change and economic uncertainty. The article argues the party needs to ditch its cautious style and adopt bolder, more inclusive policies to stay relevant."
