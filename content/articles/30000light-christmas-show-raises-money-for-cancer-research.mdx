title: "30,000‑Light Christmas Show Raises Money for Cancer Research"
summary: "Mike de Beer from Hornsby Heights turned a single string of lights into a 30,000‑bulb spectacle that includes a flying Santa sleigh. Each year the display draws hundreds of visitors, and the family uses the event to raise money for colorectal cancer research in memory of de Beer’s aunt. Donations started at $600 and have grown to thousands. The lights cost less than a dollar a night, but the family spends a month wiring and testing the show."
