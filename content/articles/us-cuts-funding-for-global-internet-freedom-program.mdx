title: "US Cuts Funding for Global Internet Freedom Program"
summary: "For more than twenty years the U.S. funded a program that helped people around the world bypass government censorship by giving money to groups that built tools like Signal and Tor. Trump’s “Doge” drive slashed the program, and no grants were issued in 2025. The cut threatens the tech that let Iranians share protest videos, keeping authoritarian governments able to shut down the internet. A nonprofit won a lawsuit to restore some money, but the case is still being appealed."
