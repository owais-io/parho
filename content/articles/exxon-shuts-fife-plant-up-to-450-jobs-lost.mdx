title: "Exxon shuts Fife plant, up to 450 jobs lost"
summary: "ExxonMobil is shutting its 40‑year‑old chemicals plant near Cowdenbeath, Scotland, by February next year, ending work for around 200 employees and 250 contractors. The company says the UK’s economic climate and high costs make the site uncompetitive and it couldn’t find a buyer even after trying to raise about £1 bn to modernise it. The UK government offered help but said the investment required was too large. The closure has angered Scottish leaders and will leave up to 450 jobs lost."
