title: "Prison release mistakes reveal how bad the system is"
summary: "Prison release errors expose the state of neglect in the system. For 14 years of Conservative rule, prisons have been left in old, overcrowded buildings with too few staff and poor conditions. Prisoners live in dirty, unsafe places while officers struggle to keep them safe and help them reform. Violence, drug use and low pay for staff make the situation worse. Fixing this will need big investment, better pay, training and more staff to support rehabilitation."
