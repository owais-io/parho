title: "EU to give Ukraine €90bn loan, but no clear plan to use frozen Russian assets"
summary: "EU leaders have approved a €90bn loan for Ukraine, but they haven't agreed on using Russia’s frozen assets as security. Some members, like Belgium, opposed the idea, while others, such as Germany, see it as a strong message to Russia. The loan will come from the EU budget and will be paid back once reparations are received. Ukraine and its allies are still seeking additional funds for defense and civilian needs."
