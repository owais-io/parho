title: "Chicago Mayor Orders Police to Probe ICE Agents"
summary: "Chicago’s mayor Brandon Johnson has told police to investigate and document illegal actions by ICE agents in the city. The order, called ICE on Notice, gives officers a clear way to keep body‑camera footage, identify federal supervisors and hand evidence to city prosecutors. Johnson says this holds ICE accountable locally, even though federal law usually gives them priority. The move follows a court decision that blocked a Minnesota pause on the federal crackdown."
