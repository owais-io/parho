title: "UK homes cross £300,000 threshold"
summary: "In January, Halifax said the average price of a UK house hit £300,077, the first time it passed £300,000. Prices rose 0.7% from the previous month, the fastest jump since November 2024, and up 1% year‑on‑year. Nationwide’s estimate is lower at £270,873. The rise comes after a dip over Christmas and is supported by lower bank rates, but affordability still worries many buyers and the housing market remains cautious."
