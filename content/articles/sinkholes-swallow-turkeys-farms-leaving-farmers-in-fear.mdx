summary: "Sinkholes are appearing everywhere in Turkey’s Konya province, swallowing fields and houses and leaving farmers terrified. Scientists blame a rapid drop in groundwater caused by intense drought and deep wells for irrigation. About 700 holes now exist, and local farmers lose huge amounts of money and land. Some are switching to less‑water‑hungry crops, like hemp, or practicing dry farming, but many feel they have no support and fear the future of farming in the area."
