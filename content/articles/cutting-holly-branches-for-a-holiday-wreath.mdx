title: "Cutting Holly Branches for a Holiday Wreath"
summary: "Each year I cut holly branches to make a winter wreath. I mix the red berries and green leaves with moss, rosemary, ivy, and ferns I find. The tree I choose has female flowers, so its berries are sweet and help birds when food is scarce. Holly leaves have sharp spines to keep deer out and can even protect the tree from lightning. The wreath ends up looking festive and safe for the house."
