title: "Trump sues BBC for $10bn over documentary, BBC plans to fight"
summary: "Former U.S. President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the BBC, claiming the broadcaster damaged his reputation with a documentary. The BBC says the claim is baseless because the court has no right to hear it – the video was never shown in the U.S. and the BBC doesn’t broadcast there. The BBC will try to dismiss the case and fight back, but the legal battle could cost tens of millions of pounds."
