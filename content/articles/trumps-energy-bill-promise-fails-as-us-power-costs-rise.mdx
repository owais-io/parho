title: "Trump’s Energy Bill Promise Fails as U.S. Power Costs Rise"
summary: "Power bills in the U.S. have gone up, not down, in the year since President Trump took office. Data shows a 6.7% rise, about $116 more for a typical family, with Washington D.C. and Indiana hit hardest. Gas prices are also climbing, causing more unpaid bills and disconnections. Trump's focus on fossil fuels and AI, and cuts to clean‑energy projects, have made it hard to lower costs. Families are now paying more and struggling to keep lights on."
