title: "UK Minister Sends Telegraph Sale to Regulators Over Media Diversity Concerns"
summary: "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has sent the £500 million deal that would sell the Telegraph titles to the Daily Mail’s parent company, DMGT, to competition and media regulators. She says the sale could shrink the number of independent voices in the right‑leaning press and give one group too much control. The Competition and Markets Authority and Ofcom will review the deal and report by mid‑June. The sale has already stalled in the past, and this new review could delay it further."
