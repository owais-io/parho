title: "Blair’s WI speech flop – advisers let him miss the mark"
summary: "Tony Blair’s advisers were busy editing his speech to the Women’s Institute in 2000, but their changes made it feel too political and out of touch. They added policy talk and pushed for mentions of the Queen and Tate Modern, which the WI members found patronising. The final speech was met with heckles, slow clapping and a sense that Blair missed the audience’s tone – a clear political blunder."
