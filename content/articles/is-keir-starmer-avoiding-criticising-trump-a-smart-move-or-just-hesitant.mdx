title: "Is Keir Starmer Avoiding Criticising Trump a Smart Move or Just Hesitant?"
summary: "The piece compares Trump's blunt, self‑serving speech to Starmer's cautious public speaking, arguing Starmer's silence on Trump may be a realpolitik strategy to keep Britain aligned with the US while building EU ties. It notes Starmer's background as a human‑rights lawyer, his attempts to keep UK‑US relations smooth, and the trade‑offs between moral condemnation and practical diplomacy. The article warns that Starmer's indecisiveness risks Britain being left out of global decisions."
