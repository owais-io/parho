title: "Trump Nominates Kevin Warsh as New Federal Reserve Chair"
summary: "Trump has nominated Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve chair. He says Warsh will be loyal, but many worry it could undermine the Fed’s independence. Warsh was a hawk on inflation, now he’s said he’ll cut rates. The Senate must confirm him, and some Republicans may block the vote. Markets reacted calmly, but critics fear a political hit on the central bank."
