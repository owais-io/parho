title: "Aukus Submarine Deal Faces Big Problems"
summary: "Australia, the UK and the US have teamed up under the Aukus pact to give Australia nuclear‑powered submarines. But the plan is shaky. The US shipyard is behind schedule and has built far fewer submarines than promised, and the UK says it can’t make the nuclear reactors needed on time. Because the US can only give Australia boats it no longer needs, the deal may not deliver the ships Australia wants."

Australia, the UK and the US have teamed up under the Aukus pact to give Australia nuclear‑powered submarines. But the plan is shaky. The US shipyard is behind schedule and has built far fewer submarines than promised, and the UK says it can’t make the nuclear reactors needed on time. Because the US can only give Australia boats it no longer needs, the deal may not deliver the ships Australia wants.
