title: "Amazon river activists win against privatization"
summary: "In Brazil’s Amazon, about 1,000 indigenous people—mainly Munduruku, Arapiún and Apiaká—occupied a Cargill grain terminal and blocked a soy barge to stop the government from privatising the Tapajós River. Their actions forced a reversal of the decree that would have opened the river to private companies, rail and road projects. It also stops plans for a huge canal that would bring more trucks and barges, protecting the river, forest and local communities from commercial exploitation."
