title: "Parents of seriously ill children say they lack financial help"
summary: "Parents of a young boy who died from a rare cancer say the UK’s current rules leave them without enough money when they must stay with a sick child at the hospital. The family wants a new law – “Hugh’s law” – that would give paid leave and support to parents of children in long‑term care. A Premier League club will start offering the same pay, and ministers are reviewing the idea."
