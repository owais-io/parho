title: "Trump Says Venezuela’s Oil Is the Real Reason for His Military Moves"
summary: "Trump made oil the main focus of his press conference, saying Venezuela’s oil was stolen from the US and must be taken back. He ignored the “war on drugs” reason he used for the build‑up. In reality, US companies never owned Venezuelan oil—only temporary rights. The country’s oil reserves are under state control, and sanctions have hurt production. Some firms like Chevron still work there, but returning is hard."
