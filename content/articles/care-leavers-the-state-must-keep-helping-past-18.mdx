title: "Care leavers: the state must keep helping past 18"
summary: "Children raised in care in England have poorer health, higher crime rates and worse life chances. They’re 62% more likely to die before 75 and four times as likely to get a criminal record. Even though numbers have fallen, they’re still high. New rules give care leavers free prescriptions, dental and eye care up to 25 and offer mental‑health support and NHS internship pilots. But councils face staff shortages and few foster carers, leaving many care leavers with little support after 18."
