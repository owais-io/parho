summary: "Iceland planted purple lupin flowers to stop soil erosion, but the plants have spread out of control. Tourists flock each summer to take pictures in the bright fields, turning lupins into a national icon. Scientists warn the weeds crowd out native plants and can cause landslides. While some say the lupin helps regrow vegetation, many experts say it’s too late to remove them and that they must be kept out of key wildlife areas."
