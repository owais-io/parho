title: "Bonobo Can Pretend Like Kids, Study Finds"
summary: "Scientists tested a bonobo named Kanzi to see if he could understand pretend objects. By rewarding him to point at cups that were “filled” with juice, even though they were empty, Kanzi chose the right cup more often than chance. He could also tell the difference between real juice and imagined juice, and even spot an imaginary grape. The study shows that bonobos can play pretend, a skill we thought was uniquely human."
