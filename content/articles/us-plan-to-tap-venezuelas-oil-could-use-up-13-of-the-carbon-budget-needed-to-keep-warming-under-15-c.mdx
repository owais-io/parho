title: "US plan to tap Venezuela's oil could use up 13% of the carbon budget needed to keep warming under 1.5 °C"
summary: "US plan to tap Venezuela's oil could use up 13% of the remaining carbon budget needed to keep global warming below 1.5 °C. The country has huge, but dirty, heavy crude reserves that would add 0.5–1.6 million barrels a day by 2050. Extracting this would take most of the emissions limit, forcing us further from climate targets. Experts say the move is reckless and would harm people and the planet."
