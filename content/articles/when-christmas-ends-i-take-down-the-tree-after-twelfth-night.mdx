title: "When Christmas Ends: I Take Down the Tree After Twelfth Night"
summary: "After Twelfth Night, I start pulling down my Christmas decorations. I cherish the holiday’s mischief but prefer my own way of saying goodbye, so I use a sustainably‑grown tree from Willis Farm and a mix of personal ornaments—like a wooden goose, a beaver in a walnut, and clay baubles made by my kids. I’ll save mistletoe berries, break up the wreath, and reuse greenery in the garden. The routine lets me honor memories while cleaning up."
