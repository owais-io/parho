title: "Scientists Bring Green and Golden Bell Frogs Back to Canberra After 50 Years"
summary: "Scientists released 25 green and golden bell frogs into Canberra's wetlands after almost 50 years of absence. The frogs were raised, immunised against the deadly chytrid fungus, and named by volunteers. The project plans 15 releases totalling about 375 frogs. Special “frog spas” with salty water and heat‑trapping pyramids protect young frogs from the fungus. The goal is rapid population growth to help the endangered species thrive again."
