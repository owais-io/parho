title: "Daily Mail buys Telegraph newspapers for £500m"
summary: "The owner of the Daily Mail, Lord Rothermere, has agreed to buy the Telegraph newspapers for £500 million. This will make a big right‑wing media group. The deal will be checked by Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority, and the government will also review it. It could change how the Telegraph is run, but the editors will stay separate. Some Labour politicians worry the move gives the Mail too much power."
