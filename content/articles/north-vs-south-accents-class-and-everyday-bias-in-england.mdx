title: "North vs. South: Accents, Class, and Everyday Bias in England"
summary: "People from the North and South of England share personal stories about how accents, stereotypes and class differences shape their daily lives. In letters to The Guardian, they describe being mocked, misunderstood, or judged because of where they grew up. Some note that northern accents are often seen as blunt, while southern accents are seen as snobbish. The writers argue that the real divide is about class, not geography, and that biases persist in education, work and social life."
