title: "Afghan Women Lose Medical Care as Taliban Ban Education and Jobs"
summary: "Taliban rule is ending medical help for Afghan women. The new policy stops girls from studying after primary school and cuts off most jobs for women. Women can no longer become doctors, nurses, or midwives, and they can’t ask men for medical care. As a result, the next generation will have no female health workers, leaving women without needed treatment or safe pregnancies."
