title: "When Being Late Can Actually Be Polite"
summary: "Many people think lateness is always rude, but it can sometimes be kind. For instance, if a friend is cooking and likely to run into trouble, arriving ten or thirty minutes late shows you understand. The article lists other situations – dating, meeting new mums, breaking up, or picking up a pet – where a short delay can help. Use your judgement and consider what the other person truly needs."
