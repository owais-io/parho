title: "Early Snow in New York, Storm in Spain Wipes Out Holiday Lights"
summary: "New York saw its first snow since 2018, with 21 cm on Long Island and a few centimeters in Central Park. In southern Spain, Storm Emilia produced a tornado that tore through La Cala de Mijas, destroying £67 000 of Christmas lights and causing about £500 000 in damage. The tornado formed when warm moist air rose, cold air sank, and wind shear spun a rotating column, producing 80‑mph gusts only in the immediate area."
