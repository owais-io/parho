title: "Sydney Protesters Chant Phrase Premier Wants to Ban"
summary: "On Monday, a crowd of around 300 gathered at Sydney’s Town Hall to support Palestine. They chanted “globalise the intifada,” a phrase the state premier, Chris Minns, says should be banned because it could inspire violence. The rally also honored a 10‑year‑old victim of a Bondi Beach shooting. New protest‑law proposals would curb rallies for three months after terror attacks, sparking anger among protestors who fear losing their right to speak out."
