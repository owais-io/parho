title: "UK Government to Stop Water Company CEOs From Getting Banned Bonuses"
summary: "UK regulators plan to close loopholes that let CEOs of failing water firms still earn huge bonuses, even after a ban last year. The government says the rules only covered “performance” bonuses, letting companies label payments differently or use parent firms to slip past the ban. New rules will stop such tricks and require companies to show real performance before paying bonuses. Critics say it will bring better accountability and stop money being misused."
