title: "Killing Survivors at Sea Is Illegal, Says 1919 German Court"
summary: "In 1919 a German court found two U‑boat officers guilty of killing survivors after the Canadian hospital ship Llandovery Castle was torpedoed. The judge said the rule that you may not kill people who survived a sea attack is simple and everyone knows it. The court refused the “I was following orders” excuse. This case is still cited in today’s international criminal law, like the Rome Statute."
