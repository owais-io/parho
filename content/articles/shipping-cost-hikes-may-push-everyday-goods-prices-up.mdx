title: "Shipping Cost Hikes May Push Everyday Goods Prices Up"
summary: "A study by the procurement group CIPS says shipping costs are rising fast, and that could push up prices for things we buy like computers, appliances, and transport gear. More than a fifth of companies saw a 10‑plus percent jump in shipping costs, while 18% noted similar rises for computers. The report warns that this volatility might become normal, meaning consumers could face higher prices in 2026."
