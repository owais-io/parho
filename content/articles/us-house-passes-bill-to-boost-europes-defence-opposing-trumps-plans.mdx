title: "U.S. House Passes Bill to Boost Europe’s Defence, Opposing Trump’s Plans"
summary: "The U.S. House of Representatives passed a big defense bill that will spend more money on Europe’s security and stop the Trump administration from pulling troops or cutting equipment. The $900 billion law keeps at least 76,000 U.S. soldiers in Europe for 45 days and gives extra help to Ukraine and the Baltics. It also keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea and limits Trump‑favored cuts to diversity training."
