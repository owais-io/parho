title: "NYC Ends MetroCard Sales, Switches to Contactless Pay"
summary: "On January 1 the MTA stopped selling MetroCards and began using Omny, a contactless system that lets riders tap their card, phone or smart device to pay fares. The MetroCard, a staple for over 30 years, was praised for its unlimited‑ride option but often jammed because of its magnetic strip. New Yorkers marked its retirement with a small ceremony, but now everyone will rely on tap‑and‑go payments."
