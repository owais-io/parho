title: "Trump’s political movement is Europe’s biggest danger"
summary: "European leaders fear Trump, but the real danger is his ideas spreading across Europe. His “second revolution” has helped right‑wing parties like the AfD, National Rally, Vox and Fidesz grow by blaming liberal democracy for crises such as the 2008 crash, the euro crisis, the refugee wave, Covid and the Ukraine war. These parties push strict borders, higher tariffs, and use social‑media memes to win working‑class voters. European parties must listen, offer new solutions, and stop copying the divisive rhetoric."
