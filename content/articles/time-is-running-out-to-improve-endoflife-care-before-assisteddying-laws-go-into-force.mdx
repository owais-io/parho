title: "Time is running out to improve end‑of‑life care before assisted‑dying laws go into force"
summary: "Parliament is debating assisted‑dying bills in England, Wales and Scotland, but many experts say the real problem is poor end‑of‑life care. Hospices are losing beds and staff, and most people who need palliative care do not get it. The article argues that the laws should be delayed until better care is available, and warns that the two countries’ rules could create a two‑tier system. It calls for more funding and better access to hospice and home care for all."
