title: "US Politics Will Stir the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics"
summary: "The 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Games ended with athletes like Alysa Liu and Chloe Kim showing a quiet, inclusive patriotism. Yet U.S. politics kept intruding—Trump used sports to push messages and questions about the country’s divisions hit athletes. With NBC paying $7.75bn for U.S. rights through 2032, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics could bring even more political noise, especially if Trump remains in office."
