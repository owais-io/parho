title: "Beware of New‑Year Gym Scams on Social Media"
summary: "Many people look to start the year fitter, and scammers take advantage with fake gym deals on Facebook and other sites. They copy real ads, promise huge discounts or limited spots, and ask for payment before giving any membership. The fraudsters may also sell bogus personal‑trainer plans or data‑gathering apps. To stay safe, double‑check the web address, avoid links from untrusted messages, and never pay by bank transfer. If you’re scammed, contact your bank and Action Fraud."
