title: "NIH Still Funds Cat Experiments, Watchdog Says, Even After Promise to Stop"
summary: "The NIH says it will phase out research on cats, but watchdog group White Coat Waste found the agency has given more than $1.7 million in new and extended grants for cat studies since July. Experiments involve kittens having brain injuries or eye disease, then being killed for analysis. WCW says the NIH’s claim of legal limits is wrong and urges the agency to cancel all cat projects.
