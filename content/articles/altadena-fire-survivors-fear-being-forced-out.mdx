title: "Altadena Fire Survivors Fear Being Forced Out"
summary: "After the 2022 Eaton fire, Altadena’s mostly Black residents have lost homes, are being called to sell their lots by investors, and face slow insurance payouts. Historic redlining pushed the community into a wildfire‑prone area. Investors buying cheap lots and slow rebuilding rules are turning the neighborhood into a climate‑gentrified spot. Local charities and state aid help, but many still struggle to rebuild and stay."
