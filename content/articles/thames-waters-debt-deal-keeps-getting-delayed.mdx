title: "Thames Water’s Debt Deal Keeps Getting Delayed"
summary: "Thames Water’s investors said they’d quit funding the company 20 months ago, so creditors are trying to rescue it by wiping out debt and adding new money. But the regulator, Ofwat, is taking longer than expected to agree on the plan. Creditors want a larger write‑down and more equity, clear rules on how the money will be spent, and fair penalties for bad performance. The delay suggests Ofwat is pushing for tougher terms to protect water users."
