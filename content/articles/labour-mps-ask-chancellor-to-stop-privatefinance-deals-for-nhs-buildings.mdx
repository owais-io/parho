title: "Labour MPs ask chancellor to stop private‑finance deals for NHS buildings"
summary: "Forty Labour MPs have written to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, asking her to scrap plans to use private finance initiatives (PFI) to build NHS hospitals. They say PFIs add costly debt, hurt patient services, and risk public trust. The MPs warn that private‑partner funding is more expensive than public money and could damage future budgets. They urge the government to fund NHS projects with public money instead."
