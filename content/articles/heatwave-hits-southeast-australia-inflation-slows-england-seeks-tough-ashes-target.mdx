summary: "Australia is in the grip of its worst heatwave since 2019‑20, with temperatures hitting the 40s across South Australia and Victoria. Fire danger is “upper‑end extreme” and a blaze in Victoria’s north‑east is still out of control. Meanwhile, Australian inflation fell to 3.4%, reducing worries that the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates in February. In England’s Ashes cricket series, a big score from England’s opener has made setting a target for Australia even tougher."
