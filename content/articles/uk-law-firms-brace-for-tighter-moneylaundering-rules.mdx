title: "UK law firms brace for tighter money‑laundering rules"
summary: "UK law firms must get ready for tougher money‑laundering rules. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will now supervise the legal sector, replacing nine regulators, including the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The FCA can issue bigger fines and will use data‑driven checks. The change comes as the UK faces a 2027 review by the FATF, which wants stronger oversight. Firms could see more scrutiny and higher penalties if they don’t meet new standards."
