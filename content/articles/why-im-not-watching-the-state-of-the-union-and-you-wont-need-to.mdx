title: "Why I’m Not Watching the State of the Union (And You Won’t Need To)"
summary: "I’m not going to watch Trump’s State of the Union because I think he’s unfit for office, full of lies, and has broken the rule of law. He keeps cutting grants, ignores the middle class, and keeps talking about winning while the economy hurts ordinary people. Instead of giving him airtime, I’ll skip it and let others do the same."
