title: "The “Time of Monsters” Quote Is Misattributed to Gramsci"
summary: "The Guardian article shows that the phrase “the time of monsters” – used by politicians, influencers and journalists to describe today’s chaos – does not come from Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Marxist. It first appeared in early 2000s French and English writings and was later popularised by Slavoj Žižek. Gramsci’s own notes talk about “morbid symptoms”, not monsters. The piece explains how the misquote spreads across politics and oversimplifies complex ideas."
