title: "Trump Pulls Back on Greenland Deal, Drops Tariff Threats"
summary: "President Trump said he would work on a deal with Denmark over Greenland, after earlier threatening tariffs on eight European countries. Danish officials welcomed the move, but many Greenlanders and Danish politicians remain skeptical, saying the talks did not include Greenland’s people. The deal could let the U.S. build bases and mine minerals in parts of Greenland. European leaders called the step a sign of de‑escalation, while markets steadied after the announcement."
