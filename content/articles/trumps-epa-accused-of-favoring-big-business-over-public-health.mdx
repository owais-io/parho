title: "Trump’s EPA Accused of Favoring Big Business Over Public Health"
summary: "The Trump‑era EPA has rolled back many rules that protect air, water and climate. It cut limits on car and power‑plant pollution, cut support for clean‑energy grants, and even dropped the 2009 finding that greenhouse gases harm people. The agency also stopped valuing human health in its cost‑benefit studies. Critics say the agency now prioritizes industry costs over public health, and thousands of staff have been fired or forced to retire."
