title: "Rehiring Solskjær could backfire for Manchester United"
summary: "Manchester United might bring back former player Ole Gunnar Solskjær as a temporary coach. Some think this could backfire because the club has already fired several managers. Solskjær did well in 2018‑19, but his later stint ended in defeats. If results stay poor, fans and the board will be angry. The move shows the club’s unstable leadership and could damage its chances in Europe. It could also hurt Solskjær’s future chances of staying in football."
