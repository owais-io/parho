title: "Academics Must Reject Associations with Jeffrey Epstein"
summary: "Professor Kate Soper writes in the Guardian that academics who flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet or accepted his favors have no good excuse. She argues they should feel ashamed, as Epstein’s influence was all about money and sex, not scholarship. Soper reminds readers that academics enjoy privilege and autonomy, yet they cannot ignore the moral damage of partnering with a known predator. The letter urges a clear break from such ties."
