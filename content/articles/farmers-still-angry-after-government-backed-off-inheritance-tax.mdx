title: "Farmers Still Angry After Government Backed Off Inheritance Tax"
summary: "In October, Labour’s budget added a new inheritance tax on farms, sparking angry protests at the Oxford farming conference. The government later raised the tax threshold from £1 million to £2.5 million, a move welcomed by some groups but not enough to calm farmers. They say the tax still hurts the ability to pass farms to children and that the government is attacking rural life. Environment minister Emma Reynolds says ministers listened, but many farmers feel betrayed and doubt Labour’s commitment to rural Britain."
