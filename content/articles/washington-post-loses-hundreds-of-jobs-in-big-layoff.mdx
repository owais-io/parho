title: "Washington Post Loses Hundreds of Jobs in Big Layoff"
summary: "The Washington Post announced a big layoff, cutting about a third of its staff—hundreds of jobs—today. Chief editor Matt Murray said the move was a “strategic reset” to keep the paper competitive. The cuts include ending the sports desk, trimming local and international reporting, cutting the books desk and a podcast, and focusing on politics, national security and key features. Employees will receive six months of health insurance, but unions say the cuts threaten the paper’s credibility."
