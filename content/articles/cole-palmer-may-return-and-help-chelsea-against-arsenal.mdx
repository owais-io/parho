title: "Cole Palmer may return and help Chelsea against Arsenal"
summary: "Chelsea hope Cole Palmer is fit for the Sunday game against Arsenal. The forward has had a groin problem since September and last week broke a toe when he tripped at home, keeping him out of the 3‑0 win over Barcelona. He trained with the squad and might be named in the lineup, though the coach may start him late. Chelsea have won 10 of 13 games without him, and a return would lift the team’s chances."
