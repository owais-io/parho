title: "Record 5,000 Prisoners Sent Back After Early Release"
summary: "In England and Wales, a record 5,000 prisoners were sent back to jail in December, more than a third of all those released that year. Union officials say many break licence rules to deal drugs in prison. Early‑release rules let people out after 40% of their sentence, now 33%, so more offenders are out and then re‑arrested. The recall number has doubled since 2018, and probation staff are stretched. New laws aim to cut recalls and curb the in‑prison drug trade."
