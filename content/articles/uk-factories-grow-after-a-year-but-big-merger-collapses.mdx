title: "UK factories grow after a year, but big merger collapses"
summary: "Consumer borrowing in the UK slowed in October, with mortgage approvals falling to about 65,000 and credit card use dropping. Despite that, the manufacturing sector finally grew again – the PMI climbed to 50.2, the first above‑50 reading since September 2024. In Europe, factories slipped back into contraction, and a £5.3 bn UK infrastructure merger fell through. Oil prices rose after OPEC+ held output and Ukraine struck Russian tankers, while the pound slipped slightly."
