title: "I’m going to explain a chicken in a way that feels like a chat."
summary: "A chicken is a big part of many meals around the world.   We think of chicken as just protein, but it’s tied to a huge system that hurts health and the planet.   After the 1970s, the food business grew super fast, especially with fast‑food chains.   Big companies now own most farms, factories, and restaurants, and they cut costs by paying very low wages and ignoring safety.   Because of this, people get sick, the air and water get dirty, and kids struggle with diet‑related illnesses.   Recently, a former president started calling out the food industry, which shows the public is waking up to these problems.   If we look at the real cost of food—health, pollution, and wages—what feels cheap actually costs us billions more, so we need to push for safer, healthier food for everyone."
