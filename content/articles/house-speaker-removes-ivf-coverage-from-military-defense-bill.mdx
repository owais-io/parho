title: "House Speaker Removes IVF Coverage from Military Defense Bill"
summary: "The new National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was passed without a provision that would let active‑service members get insurance for in‑vitro fertilization (IVF). Speaker Mike Johnson quietly removed the clause, despite earlier bipartisan support and President Trump’s pledge to expand IVF access. The decision drew fire from infertility advocates who say it hurts military families. The bill now focuses on other military policy issues while leaving IVF out."
