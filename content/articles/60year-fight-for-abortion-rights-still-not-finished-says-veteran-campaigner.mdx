title: "60‑year fight for abortion rights still not finished, says veteran campaigner"
summary: "Diane Munday, 94, spent decades campaigning for abortion law reform in the UK. She helped get the 1967 Abortion Act passed, but women still faced prison and police raids. In June a new law removed the criminal prosecution of women seeking abortions. Munday still wants full decriminalisation, two doctors’ approval removed, and wider access. She worries about the US and recent political attacks but hopes younger MPs will protect rights."
