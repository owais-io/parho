title: "Floods Devastate UK Wildlife, Experts Warn"
summary: "Storm Chandra dumped record rain across the UK, flooding rivers and swallowing nests of butterflies, dormice and other small animals. Wildlife experts say the flood waters help scavengers like crows, but many species suffer long‑term damage. Climate change is making storms 20 % more intense, and the country has lost most of its wetlands. Restoring wetlands and reintroducing beavers could slow water flow and protect habitats."
