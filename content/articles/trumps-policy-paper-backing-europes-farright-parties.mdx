title: "Trump’s Policy Paper Backing Europe’s Far‑Right Parties"
summary: "A new Trump‑era U.S. strategy says Europe will lose its identity in two decades because of migration and EU rules. It calls for American support of nationalist, far‑right parties and for Europeans to “cultivate resistance” against what it sees as a weakening continent. The paper even cites the racist ‘great‑replacement’ theory. Germany’s foreign minister said the U.S. can’t dictate Europe’s politics, and Democrats slammed the plan as contradictory and dangerous."
