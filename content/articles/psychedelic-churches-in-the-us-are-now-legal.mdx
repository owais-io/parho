title: "Psychedelic Churches in the U.S. Are Now Legal"
summary: "In the United States, a handful of churches can now legally use psychedelic drugs like ayahuasca for religious ceremonies. The Church of Gaia in Washington won a DEA exemption, becoming the first to get approval through a petition instead of a lawsuit. Since the 2000s, about 500 such churches have emerged, using legal filings to prove their practices are sincere. The trend shows more people turning to spirituality outside mainstream religion, but the groups still face legal risks and police scrutiny."
