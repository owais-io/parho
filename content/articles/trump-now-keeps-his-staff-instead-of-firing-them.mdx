title: "Trump Now Keeps His Staff Instead of Firing Them"
summary: "During his first term, Trump fired many White House staff and was known for a high‑turnover cabinet. Since returning to office in 2024, he’s been far more reluctant to let people go. Trump says his cabinet is “fantastic” and keeps loyalists in place, even as critics point out mistakes and controversies. Senate confirmations have slowed, and Trump keeps staff who support him, hoping to avoid more drama. He’s still been quick to push federal workers to resign."
