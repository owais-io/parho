title: "England’s new special‑needs plan faces workload worries"
summary: "England’s new plan will give almost 1.3 million children with special needs individual support plans in mainstream schools. Teachers say the extra paperwork could overload staff and hurt wellbeing. The government has earmarked £1.6 bn for schools and £1.8 bn for local specialists, but unions say it’s too little. MPs worry about accountability, transitions between school stages and whether parents can enforce their children’s rights."
