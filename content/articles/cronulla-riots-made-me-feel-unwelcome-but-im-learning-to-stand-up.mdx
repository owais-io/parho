title: "Cronulla Riots Made Me Feel Unwelcome, but I’m Learning to Stand Up"
summary: "I’m a Muslim journalist who grew up in Sydney. When the 2005 Cronulla beach riots happened, the media and people around me treated me as if I didn’t belong. The story shows how racism shows up even in everyday places like beaches, gyms, and shops. After years of staying away, I finally fought back in a golf club and feel stronger. I’m learning to claim my place in this country."
