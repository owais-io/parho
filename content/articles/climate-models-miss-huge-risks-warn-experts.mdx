title: "Climate models miss huge risks, warn experts"
summary: "Researchers warn that current economic models ignore sudden, big climate disasters. They say the tools only consider slow temperature rise, not floods, heatwaves, or ice sheet collapse that could collapse whole economies. The study suggests a 50% drop in global GDP by 2100 and that we can’t bail out the planet like banks. Policymakers and investors must focus on extreme risks and cut fossil fuels faster."
