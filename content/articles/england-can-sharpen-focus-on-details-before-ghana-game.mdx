summary: "England’s 8‑0 win over China gave the Lionesses a chance to give younger players a run in a big game. Coach Sarina Wiegman and veteran Lucy Bronze said the match helped sharpen passing, movement and decision‑making. The next game is against Ghana, a 67th‑ranked side, so the team can focus on details rather than a huge challenge.
