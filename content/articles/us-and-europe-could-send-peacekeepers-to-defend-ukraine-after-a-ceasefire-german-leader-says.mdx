title: "U.S. and Europe could send peacekeepers to defend Ukraine after a cease‑fire, German leader says"
summary: "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the U.S. and Europe could send peacekeepers to protect Ukraine if a cease‑fire is reached, creating a demilitarised zone and acting against Russian attacks. The U.S. would treat Ukraine as if it were NATO. Talks in Berlin with President Zelenskiy have settled most issues, but Russia is still not involved. Meanwhile, Russia has tightened restrictions in occupied areas, labeled a German broadcaster ‘undesirable’, and is negotiating to bring back South African fighters."
