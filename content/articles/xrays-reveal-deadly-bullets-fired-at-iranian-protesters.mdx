title: "X‑rays Reveal Deadly Bullets Fired at Iranian Protesters"
summary: "A Guardian‑Factnameh joint study looked at X‑rays and CT scans from a hospital in Iran that show how protest police and the Revolutionary Guard fired shotgun pellets and big bullets at people during January protests. The images reveal many people shot in the face, chest and genitals, with some losing eyes or suffering fatal brain injuries. Experts say the pattern shows deliberate targeting, not random gunfire, and the injuries would overwhelm hospitals."
