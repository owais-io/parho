title: "Victim says police delays let father die before trial"
summary: "A woman who was abused by her father says the police took almost nine years to charge him, leaving her in deep distress and even suicidal. After she finally got a charge, the trial was postponed because of a lawyer strike. He died six months before the court heard the case, so she never saw justice served. She sued the police, got an apology, and now calls for faster investigations."
