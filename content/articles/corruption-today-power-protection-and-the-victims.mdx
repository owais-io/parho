summary: "Transparency International’s latest rankings show corruption is rising worldwide, with many countries slipping. The US, once a global anti‑corruption leader, has weakened rules under Trump, using sanctions as political weapons and attacking judges and watchdogs. This turns anti‑corruption tools into weapons that hurt ordinary people. Experts say the world must now share the fight, with the EU, Canada, and other nations stepping up to enforce honest rules and protect justice."
