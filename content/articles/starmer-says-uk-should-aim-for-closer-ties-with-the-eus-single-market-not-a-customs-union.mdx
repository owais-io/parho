title: "Starmer says UK should aim for closer ties with the EU’s single market, not a customs union"
summary: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the country should try to get closer to the EU's single market rather than form a customs union. He told the BBC that, given new trade deals and changing priorities, the single market offers better benefits. Some Labour ministers, Reform UK and Conservatives criticised the move, with Priti Patel calling it a Brexit betrayal. Starmer also said future deals would not bring back free movement but would include a youth‑mobility scheme."
