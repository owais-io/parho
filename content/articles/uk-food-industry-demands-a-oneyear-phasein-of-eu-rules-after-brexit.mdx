title: "UK Food Industry Demands a One‑Year Phase‑In of EU Rules After Brexit"
summary: "Food sector bosses in the UK are calling for a gradual shift back to EU agriculture rules, warning that an overnight change could cost businesses up to £810 million a year. They say a “cliff‑edge” approach would make many UK crops, like oats, unfit for EU markets because of differences in pesticide approvals. The industry wants a transition period similar to the one used during Brexit."
