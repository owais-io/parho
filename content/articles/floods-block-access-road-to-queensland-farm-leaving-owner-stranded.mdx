summary: "Trish Goodwin, a 62‑year‑old cattle farmer near Bluff, Queensland, is stuck at her farm after heavy rain washed away the gravel road that circles the nearby Bluff coal mine. The road was built to give her access, but the mine’s mothballing and recent flooding left it impassable. Goodwin now relies on a buggy and friends for supplies, while the mine’s owners and state government have not fixed the road. She worries that her health and isolation could worsen."
