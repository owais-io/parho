title: "Astronomers Celebrate Cancellation of $10bn Chile Project That Would Have Darkened the World’s Best Skies"
summary: "Chile has decided not to build the INNA green‑hydrogen plant near its world‑famous Atacama observatories, a move that scientists and astronomers cheered. The 3,000‑hectare site would have added light pollution, vibrations and dust that could damage the Paranal and Cerro Armazones telescopes. Astronomers argued the project would ruin measurements for telescopes that have won Nobel prizes. After months of lobbying, the Chilean regulator withdrew the proposal."
