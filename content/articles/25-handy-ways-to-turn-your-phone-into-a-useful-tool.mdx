title: "25 Handy Ways to Turn Your Phone Into a Useful Tool"
summary: "Your phone can do more than text and browse. With built‑in sensors and free apps, you can turn it into a tape measure, metal detector, remote, and even a stethoscope. Scan old photos, digitise negatives, and create animated memories. Use it for offline hiking maps, 3D scanning, sleep sounds, paint‑matching, live translation, plant ID, and a better webcam. Measure noise, track oxygen levels, control slides, share your location, log meals, record podcasts, set voice commands, and keep a smart shopping list."
