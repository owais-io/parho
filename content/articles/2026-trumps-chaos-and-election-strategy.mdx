title: "2026: Trump’s Chaos and Election Strategy"
summary: "In early 2026, Trump’s administration has taken bold steps abroad – from taking Venezuelan leaders hostage to threatening military action in Mexico and the Middle East – and is also shaking up the U.S. political scene. He wants to use the chaos to win the 2026 mid‑term elections and is already talking about a possible third term in 2028, which would break the 22nd Amendment. His supporters say he can only solve problems with force."
