title: "Assisted Dying Bill Faces Almost Certain Failure in House of Lords"
summary: "The bill that would allow people with terminal illnesses to choose assisted dying has hit a wall in the House of Lords. Backers say it is almost impossible to get a vote before the May session ends because Lords opponents use procedural delays. MPs are frustrated, calling the system dysfunctional, while peers argue the bill needs more scrutiny. With over a thousand amendments, the bill likely will fail before it can become law."
