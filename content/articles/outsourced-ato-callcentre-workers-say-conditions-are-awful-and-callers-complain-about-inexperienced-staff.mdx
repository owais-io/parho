title: "Outsourced ATO call‑centre workers say conditions are awful and callers complain about inexperienced staff"
summary: "Australian Tax Office (ATO) calls are mostly handled by workers in private call centres. Staff say they are paid less, trained poorly, and pressured to finish calls quickly. Many quit, and teams change every few months. Callers, especially tax experts, get wrong answers. The ATO’s own employees earn much more. The government and unions want better pay, training, and fewer outsourced jobs."
