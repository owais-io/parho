title: "FBI Investigates Minneapolis Protester Chats After Far‑Right Claim"
summary: "FBI Director Kash Patel announced a criminal probe into Minneapolis anti‑ICE protester chats on Signal after far‑right figure Cam Higby claimed he’d infiltrated them and said they planned to target ICE officers. The FBI says it won’t investigate peaceful protest or First Amendment rights, but will look for illegal activity. Critics say the move is an overreach, especially as it follows a separate investigation into a nurse’s death by border agents."
