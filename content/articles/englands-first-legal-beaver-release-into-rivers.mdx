title: "England’s First Legal Beaver Release into Rivers"
summary: "England finally released its first legally licensed beavers into a river system, with two animals from a Cornwall reserve making a splash. The move follows years of government delays and high licensing fees, but scientists hope the beavers will build dams that reduce flooding, improve water quality and boost wildlife. Local groups and farmers support the project, while the Wildlife Trust plans to release 100 more this year."
