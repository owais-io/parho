title: "How Much Storm Damage Can a Small Village Survive?"
summary: "Three big storms hit Torcross in January, smashing waves into the village’s old houses. The waves broke shutters, poured seawater into chimneys, and knocked out the shingle that protects the coast. The main road, A379, was ripped apart and is shut until 2027. The nearby Slapton Ley nature reserve, home to rare birds and fungi, could be threatened if the shingle strip fails. Rising sea levels and shifting storm patterns are making such damage more likely."
