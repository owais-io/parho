summary: "Billionaires’ combined wealth hit $18.3 trillion last year, up 81% since 2020, Oxfam says. That money could wipe out global poverty 26 times over, but the charity argues it’s being used to influence governments instead of helping people. Youth-led protests in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Nepal are pushing back against this “brazen” partnership between money and politics, demanding fairer rules and better services."
