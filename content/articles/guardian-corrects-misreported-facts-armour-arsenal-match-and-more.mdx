title: "Guardian Corrects Misreported Facts: Armour, Arsenal Match, and More"
summary: "The Guardian issued a set of corrections today. It clarified that the Samurai armour shown at the British Museum comes from the Royal Armouries, not the Royal Collection. The paper also fixed a mistake about Arsenal’s Carabao Cup win, noting they had played another home game against FC Kairat before Manchester United. Other tweaks dealt with Epstein‑related stories, an EV‑charging company, an obituary, a Wrexham takeover, and defence talks. Readers can send complaints to the Guardian’s editor."
