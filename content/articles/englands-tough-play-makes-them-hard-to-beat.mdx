title: "England's tough play makes them hard to beat"
summary: "England played a hard‑bitting game at Twickenham against New Zealand, showing a new style that’s tough, physical and intimidating. The team used a tight U‑shaped formation, powerful forwards, and quick kicks to dominate. They scored early but had to fight back after a slip, then pulled away with 25 points in the second half. Coach Steve Borthwick built a side that’s hard to beat, leaving the All Blacks nervous."
