title: "California Governor Hits Back at Trump’s AI Order That Tries to Stop State Rules"
summary: "Trump just issued a new AI executive order that says states can’t make their own rules about AI. California Governor Gavin Newsom blasted it, calling it a scam that hurts innovation and public trust. The order would let the federal government target state laws that don’t boost America’s AI dominance, and could withhold federal broadband funds. California already has a strict AI law that requires companies to report safety incidents and face big fines. Many lawmakers, unions, and child‑safety groups also slammed the move."
