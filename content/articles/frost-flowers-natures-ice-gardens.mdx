title: "Frost Flowers: Nature’s Ice Gardens"
summary: "Frost flowers are delicate, fern‑like ice crystals that grow on frozen surfaces in winter. They form when warm ice is exposed to very cold, still air, causing the ice to sublimate into vapor. As the temperature drops, this vapor freezes into tiny crystals that grow outward. The flowers need calm conditions; wind breaks them apart. They’re common on windows and frozen lakes, but usually last only a few days."
