title: "Labour’s no‑tax‑raise pledge is a bad idea"
summary: "Labour’s promise to keep taxes flat sounds nice, but it’s risky and unnecessary. Because voters just wanted the Tories gone, Labour would win anyway. Instead of saying “no taxes,” the party could say taxes might rise if the economy needs it. Manifestos are guides, not contracts; leaders must change plans when circumstances change. U‑turns that fix bad policies are good, not silly."
