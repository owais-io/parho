title: "England bans cages for hens and pigs"
summary: "England will stop keeping chickens in cages and pigs in farrowing crates, the government said. The new rules also target other cruel practices: puppy farms, electric shock collars on dogs, snare traps, trail hunting, and shooting hares during breeding season. Farmers will be guided to move to cage‑free systems next year, and fish slaughter will need to be more humane. The aim is to raise animal care standards across farms, homes and the wild."
