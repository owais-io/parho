title: "Zipcar to Shut Down Its UK Operations"
summary: "Zipcar, the world’s biggest car‑sharing service, is ending its UK business by year‑end. It will stop new bookings after Dec 31 and will consult staff about possible redundancies. The company, owned by Avis Budget, has lost £11.7 m in 2024 and faces higher London congestion charges. The closure hurts drivers who use car clubs and the wider push for sustainable transport. Existing rentals and holiday bookings will still run, and paid‑subscription customers get refunds."
