title: "UK Government Promises to Force Employment Bill Through Lords"
summary: "UK ministers say they will not back down on an employment rights bill that was rejected by the Lords. They want the bill back in Parliament next week, hoping it will pass before Christmas. The bill would raise statutory sick pay, add day‑one paternity leave and give the Fair Work Agency more powers, but it also lifts the cap on unfair‑dismissal compensation. Trade unions are angry that the Lords blocked the deal, calling it “wrecking tactics.”"
