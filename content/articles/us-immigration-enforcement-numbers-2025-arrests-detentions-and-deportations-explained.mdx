title: "US Immigration Enforcement Numbers: 2025 Arrests, Detentions and Deportations Explained"
summary: "The Guardian has been collecting every two‑week data released by ICE about arrests, detentions and deportations. Since January 2025 it scrapes the tables ICE posts, then compares each new release with the previous one to see how numbers change. Because ICE only reports arrests that lead to detention, the totals may be lower than the real count. The piece turns the raw data into simple, up‑to‑date figures that illustrate the scale of enforcement."
