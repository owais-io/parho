title: "Melbourne Open loses fans and money in heat, but still stays profitable"
summary: "Melbourne Park’s Australian Open will lose a lot of fans and cash this Tuesday as temperatures climb over 40 °C. While ticket sales and food sales drop, the tournament still meets record‑breaking attendance and revenue goals thanks to its roofed arenas that keep play cool. The event is losing about a million dollars in ticket and food revenue, but that loss won’t trigger insurance claims. Organisers are adding shade, more misters and air‑conditioned lounges to help visitors stay comfortable."
