title: "New space race: Who will own the moon’s valuable south‑pole?"
summary: "NASA’s Artemis II and China’s Chang’e 7 launch in 2026, sparking a fresh race for the moon’s resource‑rich south pole. Governments want control, but the UN treaty that forbids exploitation is vague on private claims, so rich companies are stepping in. The debate centers on nuclear power, solar energy, and whether moving work off Earth solves our resource crisis. Critics warn the same politics that divided us could spread to the moon."
