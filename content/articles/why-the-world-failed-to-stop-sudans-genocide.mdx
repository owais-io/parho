title: "Why the World Failed to Stop Sudan’s Genocide"
summary: "UN investigators say the Rapid Support Forces killed, sexually assaulted and drove out many non‑Arab residents in El Fasher, Sudan. Despite warnings from NGOs, journalists and even U.S. officials, the West kept talking with the RSF and its backer, the UAE, instead of stopping the violence. The UAE supplied guns, drones and money. Because governments still value their Gulf allies, they avoided blaming the UAE, leaving civilians unprotected. The piece calls for direct aid, sanctions on Emirati supporters, and real accountability."
