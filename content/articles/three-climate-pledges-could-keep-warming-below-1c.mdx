title: "Three climate pledges could keep warming below 1°C"
summary: "At COP30, experts say that if countries keep their pledges to triple renewable energy, double energy efficiency, and cut methane, the planet could stay below a 1‑degree rise. The study says these actions could shave 0.9°C from the warming forecast, bringing total warming to about 1.7°C by 2100. G20 nations alone could cut 18 bn tonnes of emissions by 2035. But cutting methane is harder, and governments need political will and more aid for poorer countries."
