title: "Airbus Proposes Two‑Plane Split for Europe’s Fighter Jet Project"
summary: "Airbus said it could divide Europe’s stalled fighter‑jet project into two separate aircraft to keep the programme moving. The idea comes after a quarrel between Airbus’s German and Spanish partners and France’s Dassault over who will lead the €100 bn Future Combat Air System. Germany says it doesn’t need a nuclear‑capable jet, while France does. Airbus wants the decision to be made by customers, not politicians. The plan could allow more partners to join."
