title: "Labour Criticises Greens, Exposing Political Double Standards"
summary: "Labour's criticism of the Greens shows how left‑wing ideas are unfairly called unrealistic. The article says Britain feels broken and the right, plus media, spread doom about migrants and welfare. Keir Starmer's team says the Greens are promising the impossible. It points out that policies helping working‑class families are dismissed, while rich‑favoured ideas are seen as normal. It also notes media coverage favours the right and that voters are starting to trust Greens for real change."
