title: "Environment Agency Must Pay Millions in Landfill Tax to Clean Illegal Waste"
summary: "The Environment Agency (EA) has to pay a huge landfill tax if it clears illegal waste dumps. For a single site in Kent, £4m of a £15m cost is tax. MPs say the tax stops the EA from cleaning other sites, like a pile in Wigan that smells, attracts rats and caused a fire. Criminals make money by dumping waste and hiding the tax. The EA says it’s investigating and working with police, but residents still suffer."
