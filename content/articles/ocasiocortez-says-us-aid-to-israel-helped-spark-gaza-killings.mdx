summary: "During a Munich security conference, Representative Alexandria Ocasio‑Cortez told a panel that U.S. military aid to Israel should be re‑examined because it helped fuel violence in Gaza. She cited the Leahy laws, which say U.S. money must not go to foreign forces that commit human‑rights abuses, and said that unconditional aid had made a genocide in Gaza possible. She criticized the current administration’s approach and warned that Democrats may need to shift their stance for the 2028 election."
