title: "What Happens When Ski Resorts Shut Down? Will Nature Take Over?"
summary: "More than 180 ski resorts in France are now closed because of rising temperatures and short winter seasons. The old Céüze 2000 resort, open for 85 years, shut down in 2018 when snow was unreliable and running the lifts cost too much. Workers left maps and a bottle of water as a memory, and the site is now being taken apart to stop pollution. Early signs of nature returning – trees, wildflowers and birds – show that the mountains can heal."
