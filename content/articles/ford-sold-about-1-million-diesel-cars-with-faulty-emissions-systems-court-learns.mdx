title: "Ford sold about 1 million diesel cars with faulty emissions systems, court learns"
summary: "About a million Ford diesel cars sold in the UK between 2016‑2018 had faulty emissions parts that let too much pollution escape. Engineers knew the problem but the cars weren’t recalled or fixed, lawyers say. Owners of 1.6 million diesel cars are suing five manufacturers, including Ford, for cheating emissions tests. Ford says it just made the cars safer in the lab, but the court is hearing the case."
