title: "The Australian Fires 4,000‑Word Retort After Press Council Rules It Wrong"
summary: "A press watchdog said The Australian published three misleading stories about former ACT prosecutor Shane Drumgold, and the paper replied with a 4,000‑word defence. The article questions the council’s competence and notes that the newspaper’s owner, News Corp, pays most of its budget. It also highlights a journalist’s failure to disclose her role in the inquiry and the council’s insistence that its decision was based on editorial standards, not law."
