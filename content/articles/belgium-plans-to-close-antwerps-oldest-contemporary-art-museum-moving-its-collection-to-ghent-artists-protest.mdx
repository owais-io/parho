title: "Belgium plans to close Antwerp’s oldest contemporary art museum, moving its collection to Ghent – artists protest"
summary: "Artists protest Belgium’s plan to shut down Antwerp’s oldest contemporary art museum and move its 8,000‑piece collection to Ghent. The Flanders region says the move will save money, but critics call it illegal and a loss for the city’s cultural life. Notable artists, including Luc Tuymans and Anish Kapoor, warn the collection will be at risk. Belgium faces a budget deficit, and the plan to merge museums may not cut costs as promised. Ghent’s museum would need extra space."
