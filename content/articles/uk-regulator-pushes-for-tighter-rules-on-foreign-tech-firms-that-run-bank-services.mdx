title: "UK regulator pushes for tighter rules on foreign tech firms that run bank services"
summary: "Sarah Pritchard, FCA’s deputy chief, says the UK must tighten control over foreign tech companies that run bank services. She points to outages, like Amazon’s glitch that stopped Lloyds and the London Stock Exchange, showing the danger of relying on just a few overseas firms. The Treasury hasn’t named any of these companies as “critical third parties,” so they’re not under regulation. The FCA, PRA and Bank of England can supervise, but more action is needed to keep banking safe."
