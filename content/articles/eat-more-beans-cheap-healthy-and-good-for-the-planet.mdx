title: "Eat More Beans: Cheap, Healthy, and Good for the Planet"
summary: "Chefs like Jamie Oliver are pushing people to eat more beans because they’re cheap, nutritious, and good for the environment. Beans give protein and fiber without the high cost of meat and can be added to favorites like chilli, pasta, or even desserts. You can buy them canned, jarred, or dry – the dry ones are the cheapest and last long. Simple recipes and bulk buying help keep your food bill low while adding flavour and health."
