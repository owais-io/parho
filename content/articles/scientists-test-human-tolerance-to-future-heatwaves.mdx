title: "Scientists Test Human Tolerance to Future Heatwaves"
summary: "In a lab that mimics the hottest days we might see, scientist Graham Readfearn steps inside a climate chamber to see how the body reacts to extreme heat. The experiment measures heart rate, sweat, and how quickly people get tired. The results help predict what people could feel during future heatwaves, and guide safety tips and design for buildings and clothing. The study shows that staying cool and hydrated is vital for health when temperatures rise."
