title: "Europeans Say State Pensions Will Soon Be Too Expensive"
summary: "A poll in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Poland and the UK shows most people think the current state pension system is already too expensive and will get even worse. While retirees feel their pensions are affordable, they also say the amounts are too low. Most citizens oppose raising the retirement age, adding taxes or cutting benefits. Some do support extra private pensions and higher taxes on rich retirees to help the poor."
