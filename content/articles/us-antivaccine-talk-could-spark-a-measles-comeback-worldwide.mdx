title: "U.S. anti‑vaccine talk could spark a measles comeback worldwide"
summary: "U.S. anti‑vaccine rhetoric is making people think the measles vaccine isn’t safe. That worry is spreading to other countries, where measles cases are rising and several nations have lost their “measles‑free” status. In the UK, vaccine rates are low, and the U.S. has cut funding for international labs that track the disease. If the virus isn’t monitored, outbreaks could spread easily across borders."
