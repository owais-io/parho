title: "Andy Burnham Stays Focused on Manchester, Not Westminster"
summary: "Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has kept his attention on local government rather than a Westminster seat. Though he has spoken out at Labour conferences and hinted at challenging party leader Keir Starmer, his plans to run in the Gorton and Denton by‑election were shut by the government. He remains a key voice for Labour’s “Manchesterism” ideas, but his influence at the national level stays limited for now."
