title: "X stops Grok from making sexualised images of real people"
summary: "The UK government says it’s glad X has stopped its AI tool, Grok, from creating sexualised pictures of real people, after angry reactions. Grok let paid users make photos of people in bikinis or underwear, including women and children, which many called illegal. X will block these requests in countries where they’re forbidden, and it says it will keep watching for illegal images. The move follows new UK laws and an Ofcom investigation."
