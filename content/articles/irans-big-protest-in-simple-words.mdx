title: "**Iran’s Big Protest in Simple Words**"
summary: "The people of Iran started shouting at the government on December 28.   Why? The money they use – the rial – was losing value.   Food and groceries became very expensive.   Many Iranians were angry about the new rules that restrict what they can say and do. ### What’s Happening Inside Iran? - The government turned off the internet for almost 4 days.   - About 186 cities are showing signs of protest.   - The police and the army are using force to stop the crowds.   - Reports say that more than 600 people have been killed so far.   - Many others are hurt or have been taken to prison. ### Why the Internet Is Off The government shut down all phone networks.   You can’t use texting or most websites.   Some people can call abroad, but most still can’t use the internet.   This makes it hard for the world to know what’s really happening inside Iran. ### The U.S. Response President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that any country that sells goods to Iran will get a 25 % tariff on trade with the U.S.   He also said the U.S. may use air strikes, but he prefers talking first. ### Reactions from Other Countries - The U.N. says the violence must stop.   - Spain, France, and Germany have summoned Iran’s ambassadors to condemn the killings.   - Finland, Sweden, and other European nations are looking for ways to help the Iranian people. ### What to Do if You’re in Iran - Avoid protests.   - Keep a low profile.   - If it is safe, leave by land to Armenia or Turkey.   - If you can’t leave, stay in a safe place with food and water. ### Why It Matters Iran is a very poor country because of U.S. sanctions.   The new attacks and protests are making life even harder for everyday Iranians.   The world is watching to see if the government can keep control or if it will change. That’s the quick summary of what’s going on in Iran right now. Stay safe, stay informed, and let’s hope for a peaceful end to the violence."
