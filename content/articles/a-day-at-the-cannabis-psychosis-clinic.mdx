summary: "Isiah, 29, almost jumped from a London shopping centre after years of paranoia caused by daily cannabis.

It’s the only UK clinic doing this, offering one‑to‑one support, group sessions, and tools to manage cravings. High‑potency cannabis is linked to more psychosis and violence. Since opening, 90 people joined, 74% stopped using, and many returned to work or study."
