title: "Mumsnet Pushes for 16‑and‑Under Social Media Ban"
summary: "Mumsnet, a UK parenting site, has launched a campaign demanding a ban on all social media for people under 16. The adverts, styled like cigarette pack warnings, say long‑term use can lead to self‑harm, anxiety, eating disorders and suicide. Parents in a 2025 survey say 92 % worry about kids’ mental health. The government plans to review age limits and safety features this summer, but experts say a blanket ban may not instantly protect teens."
