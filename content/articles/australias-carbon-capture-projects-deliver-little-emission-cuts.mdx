title: "Australia’s Carbon Capture Projects Deliver Little Emission Cuts"
summary: "Australia’s biggest carbon‑capture plan at the Gorgon LNG site has been a big disappointment. The project was supposed to trap up to 4 million tonnes of CO₂ a year, but injection rates have dropped and the real emissions saved are tiny. Experts say CCS is more hype than help and that it only adds a few percent to the climate fight. Politicians and oil companies keep backing it, even though cheap renewables are a better option."
