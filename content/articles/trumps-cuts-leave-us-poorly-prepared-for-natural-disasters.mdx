title: "Trump’s Cuts Leave U.S. Poorly Prepared for Natural Disasters"
summary: "Trump’s cuts to climate science and emergency agencies left the U.S. badly unprepared for storms. Funding and staff cuts hurt FEMA, NOAA and weather services, causing delayed responses and higher disaster costs. While Biden added billions to rebuild resilience, Trump’s plans to shrink FEMA and cut climate data made the nation’s safety net weaker. Rising extreme weather shows the damage: more fires, floods, and hurricanes are harder to manage."
