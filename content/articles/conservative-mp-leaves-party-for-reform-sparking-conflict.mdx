title: "Conservative MP Leaves Party for Reform, Sparking Conflict"
summary: "Robert Jenrick, a former shadow justice secretary, has joined the breakaway Reform party, saying the Conservatives still run the same way he dislikes. The move has led to harsh words from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who called Jenrick dishonest and warned other MPs against joining. The split could split right‑wing voters ahead of the May elections in Scotland, Wales, and English councils, making it harder for the Conservatives to compete."
