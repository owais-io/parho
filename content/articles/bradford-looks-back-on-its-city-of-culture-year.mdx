title: "Bradford looks back on its city of culture year"
summary: "Bradford spent £51 million on over 5,000 events during its 2025 city‑of‑culture year. The city celebrated with festivals, art shows, a music epic, and a new market. City leaders wonder if the buzz, jobs and talent will stay, and whether the money will lift a community where many live in poverty. Investments went to fixing buildings, adding toilets and moving a museum. Some say the impact felt only by existing fans, but the city feels more hopeful and united."
