title: "Pokémon Cards Have Turned Into a Resale Market, Leaving Kids Struggling to Buy"
summary: "Pokémon cards, once a simple hobby, are now a big money game. Adults buy packs, resell them for hundreds, and influencers show off rare finds to hype up prices. Because of this, kids can’t get new cards – stores run out, and people even queue for hours to snatch them. The market has become volatile, with fake cards and price‑tracking apps. Supply is finally catching up, but the craze will probably flare up again next year."
