title: "ActionAid Ends Child Sponsorships: Donors Question the Move"
summary: "ActionAid has decided to end its long‑running child‑sponsorship program, a move some say is part of decolonising aid. Donors who have funded children and women feel blindsided, arguing the scheme gave them a sense of making a difference. Critics say sponsorship is patronising, while supporters worry they’ll lose a source of funding. The letter calls for clearer communication and suggests newer direct‑cash models might be a better alternative."
