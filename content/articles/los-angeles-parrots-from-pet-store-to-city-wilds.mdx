title: "Los Angeles Parrots: From Pet Store to City Wilds"
summary: "The parrots you hear in Pasadena and Malibu were originally sold as pets in the 1970s. After a fire or escape, they spread across Los Angeles. Today, thousands live in city trees, making loud calls and even mixing between species. Scientists study how they adapt, breed, and whether they could help save endangered birds back in Mexico. While some locals love their chatter, others worry about their numbers and impact on native birds."
