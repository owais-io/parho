title: "Anika Wells' expense scandal sparks debate over family support in parliament"
summary: "Anika Wells, Australia's sport and communications minister, has faced criticism over her use of parliamentary expenses, including a $100,000 New York trip and paying her husband to attend sporting events. The Guardian says such spending is legal but may seem out of line with taxpayers’ expectations. The article argues that while the money is not illegal, the rules should help MPs with families, especially women, to stay in politics. The debate shows that parliament still needs more family‑friendly changes."
