title: "Starlink shut off for Russian troops, forcing new communication plans"
summary: "Ukraine disabled Starlink internet for Russian forces after talks with Elon Musk. The move cuts off a fast, reliable network Russians used to link units, call drones, and avoid jamming. Russian troops now have to rely on slower, less mobile options like fibre, Wi‑Fi bridges, or old satellite gear. The loss has caused chaos on the front, angering pro‑war Russian supporters and forcing the army to scramble for backups."
