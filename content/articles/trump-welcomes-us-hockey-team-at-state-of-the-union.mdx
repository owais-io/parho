title: "Trump Welcomes US Hockey Team at State of the Union"
summary: "At the State of the Union, President Trump greeted the US men’s national hockey team and praised them for winning Olympic gold. He announced the players would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom and used them as a symbol of American success. The visit was politically charged: some players were absent, the women’s team declined the invitation, and Trump’s remarks about Canada and China made the event feel more about loyalty than sport."
