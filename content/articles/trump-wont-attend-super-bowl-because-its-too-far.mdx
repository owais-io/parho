title: "Trump Won’t Attend Super Bowl Because It’s Too Far"
summary: "Former President Donald Trump said he won’t attend next month’s Super Bowl in California because the trip is too far, after the league’s choice of performers sparked criticism. He noted he might have come if the venue was closer and added that the entertainment lineup, including Bad Bunny and Green Day, didn’t influence his decision. Trump’s decision means he won’t repeat last year’s appearance, which was historic as the first sitting U.S. president at the event."
