title: "Premium Bonds Get Harder to Win From April"
summary: "Premium bonds in the UK will be harder to win from April, as the government cuts the share of money paid out in prizes from 3.6% to 3.3%. That means the odds of winning a prize rise from 1 in 22,000 to 1 in 23,000. While the total prize pool stays about £375 million, the number of big prizes drops, and £25 prizes increase. People who want a guaranteed return should look at other savings accounts."
