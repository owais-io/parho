title: "Labour MPs Banned from Pubs After Budget Rate Hike"
summary: "Labour MPs are banned from pubs across the UK because pubs put up “No Labour MPs” signs after the chancellor’s budget raised business rates for pubs. The budget didn’t change rates, only cut headline rates and gave £4.3bn support, but a re‑valuation means rates jump 76% for pubs. The move hurts pubs' profits and raises pint prices, and many MPs say they’re being shouted at. The protests risk turning the budget into a political hit."
