title: "Quagga mussels flood Lake Geneva, damaging buildings and the lake"
summary: "Quagga mussels have invaded Lake Geneva, clogging the 5‑km pipe network that cools the Swiss Federal Technology Institute (EPFL). The shells block water, raising building temperatures and threatening research labs and a nuclear‑fusion experiment. The mussels also cover everything in the lake, choking out native snails, shrimps and even the deepest parts. With no way to stop them, scientists warn that the lake and its fishing industry will change forever."
