title: "Cutting property tax breaks could still help Australians buy homes"
summary: "The article explains why Australian tax breaks for property investors—especially the 50 % capital‑gain discount—are unfair and only help the richest. Cutting or ending the discount would cost the government a lot of extra money and could give more low‑income people a chance to own homes. It would lower house prices a little, but the main benefit is to shift the market from investors to homeowners and make the tax system fairer."
