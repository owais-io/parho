title: "Brighton Beach Covered in Onion Litter After Shipping Containers Wash Ashore"
summary: "In Brighton, thousands of onions and other trash fell onto the beach after several shipping containers slipped off ships. Residents saw masks, gloves, plastic, even whole containers of produce. Local groups and councils collected almost 2 tonnes of rubbish. The problem, worsened by storms, highlights how lost containers spread plastic and food waste along the coast. New rules now require companies to report lost containers, but cleanup still depends on volunteers."
