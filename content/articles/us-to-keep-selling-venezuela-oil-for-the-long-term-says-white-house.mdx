title: "US to Keep Selling Venezuela Oil for the Long Term, Says White House"
summary: "The U.S. wants to control all Venezuelan oil sales for an indefinite time. After seizing tankers carrying Venezuelan oil, the White House plans to sell the stored oil and any future production in global markets, using the money for Venezuelans. The move could lower oil prices and strain U.S.–China ties, as China imports most of Venezuela’s oil. Trump and U.S. officials say they’ll help rebuild Venezuela’s oil industry, but experts doubt quick returns."
