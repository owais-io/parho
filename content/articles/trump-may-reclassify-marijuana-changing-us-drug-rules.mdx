title: "Trump May Reclassify Marijuana, Changing US Drug Rules"
summary: "Trump is thinking about moving marijuana from the toughest drug category to a lower one, which would make it easier to study and help the booming cannabis industry. Many Americans support the change, but it doesn't legalise weed or stop police from arresting people. The move fits Trump’s business‑friendly style at home while he still tightens drug enforcement overseas. True progress would require full de‑criminalisation and help for affected communities."
