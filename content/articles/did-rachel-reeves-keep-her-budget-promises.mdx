title: "Did Rachel Reeves Keep Her Budget Promises?"
summary: "Reeves says she kept Labour’s pledge not to raise taxes on working people, but her actions tell a different story. Last year she added 1.2p to employers’ National Insurance, and this year she froze tax thresholds for three years. As wages rise, more people—including some on state pensions—will start paying income tax, raising an extra £8 bn a year. Critics say these moves breach the manifesto, while Reeves argues they don’t change tax rates or employee NI."
