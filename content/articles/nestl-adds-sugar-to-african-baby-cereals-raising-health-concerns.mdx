title: "Nestlé Adds Sugar to African Baby Cereals, Raising Health Concerns"
summary: "A Swiss group called Public Eye tested 94 baby cereals sold in Africa and found that more than 90% had added sugar, with an average of 6 grams per serving. Nestlé says the sugar is allowed by local rules and helps babies taste the food, which could keep them from being under‑nourished. Critics say the sugar puts babies at risk of long‑term health problems and should be removed. Nestlé says it will roll out sugar‑free versions soon, but activists want it now."
