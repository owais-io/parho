title: "Australia Wins the Ashes: Numbers That Show Why They Beat England"
summary: "Australia finished the Ashes quickly and decisively, keeping the urn. Senior Australian players dominated, especially Travis Head, who scored 629 runs – more than double the next best. England's Ben Stokes, who usually plays aggressively, struggled and helped end the Bazball style. Australia’s bowlers were strong too: Mitch Starc took 31 wickets, better than the legendary 2013‑14 series. Steve Smith became the second‑most prolific Ashes scorer, and wicket‑keeper Alex Carey had 27 catches, almost matching the record."
