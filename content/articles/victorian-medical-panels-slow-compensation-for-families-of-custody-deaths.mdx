title: "Victorian medical panels slow compensation for families of custody deaths"
summary: "After a person dies in custody, families can sue the state for compensation. In Victoria, before the case can move forward, an independent medical panel reviews any psychological or physical injuries claimed. The panel is slow – it can take up to ten months, and more people are being referred, including children. Families say the delays bring back painful memories and slow justice. The government says it is hiring more experts to speed hearings."
