title: "Gas stations must lower prices as oil falls below $60 a barrel"
summary: "Oil prices dropped below $60 per barrel for the first time in almost five years, but fuel pump prices have barely changed. Retailers are being called on to pass the savings to drivers, who could save over £4.60 on a full tank if the drop of about 7p per litre were reflected. The price fall comes as hopes grow for a Russia‑Ukraine peace deal that could ease sanctions and boost oil supplies."
