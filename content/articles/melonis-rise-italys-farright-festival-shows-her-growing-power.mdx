title: "Meloni’s Rise: Italy’s Far‑Right Festival Shows Her Growing Power"
summary: "This year’s Atreju festival in Rome turned from a hard‑right gathering into a popular fair that drew students, influencers, and ordinary families. It shows how Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s party, Brothers of Italy, has moved from a fringe group to the country’s biggest political force. While her government has pushed Italy onto the world stage, it faces big problems at home – high poverty, strikes over the budget, and a shaky job market."
