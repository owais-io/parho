title: "Trump’s Venezuela Move Echoes Iraq’s Failed Intervention"
summary: "Trump says the U.S. has taken Venezuela’s dictator Maduro and will run the country, echoing the U.S. when it “won” in Iraq. But the article warns that a quick capture can hide the hard work that follows. In Iraq the U.S. spent almost $3 trillion, never fully rebuilt the nation, and faced lasting chaos. Venezuela’s damaged oil, political violence, and huge costs mean the same mistakes could repeat, not a clean victory."
