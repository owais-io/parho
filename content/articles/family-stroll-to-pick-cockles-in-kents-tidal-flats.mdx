title: "Family stroll to pick cockles in Kent’s tidal flats"
summary: "We take a yearly walk along Kent’s tidal flats to pick cockles. The trip is cold and muddy, but we come armed with rakes and buckets. Kids get excited as the shellfish surface, and we all help collect them. After bringing them home, we clean and soak the cockles, though we rarely get rid of all the sand. The real reward is the time spent together."
