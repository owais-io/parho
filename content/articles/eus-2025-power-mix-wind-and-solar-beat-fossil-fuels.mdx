title: "EU’s 2025 Power Mix: Wind and Solar Beat Fossil Fuels"
summary: "In 2025 the EU produced more electricity from wind and solar than from coal, oil and gas combined, with wind and solar together supplying 30% of all power. Fossil fuels fell to just 29%, while coal dropped below 10%. The shift shows Europe is moving away from imported gas and fossil fuels, but experts warn that the grids, batteries and storage need to catch up to handle the new wind and sun power reliably."
