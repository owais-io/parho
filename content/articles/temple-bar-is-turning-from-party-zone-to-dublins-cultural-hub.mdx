title: "Temple Bar is Turning from Party Zone to Dublin’s Cultural Hub"
summary: "Temple Bar has turned from a raucous party area into a lively cultural quarter. A 1990s redevelopment made it a trendy spot, but headlines about fights, assaults and overcrowded pubs hurt its reputation. Today, fewer late‑night licences and more art galleries, cafés and family markets give it a calmer feel. While some locals still caution visitors, many tourists enjoy its mix of culture, food and nightlife."
