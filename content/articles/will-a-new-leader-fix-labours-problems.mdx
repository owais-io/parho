title: "Will a New Leader Fix Labour’s Problems?"
summary: "In Britain, Labour’s leader Keir Starmer is the most unpopular prime‑minister‑ever, with his approval down to –54%. Inside the party, MPs wonder if a new face could help, but history shows a leader switch only works if voters give a fresh mandate. Some think Starmer should step down, while others worry a new boss might cause more chaos. Candidates like Wes Streeting and Angela Rayner could step up, but they’d need clear policies and unity to turn things around."
