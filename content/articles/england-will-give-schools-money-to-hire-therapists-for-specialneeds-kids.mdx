title: "England Will Give Schools Money to Hire Therapists for Special‑Needs Kids"
summary: "England’s government is changing how money for children with special needs is spent. Instead of councils using the budget, mainstream schools will get a direct pool to hire therapists and extra help. The move aims to cut costs that have hurt many local councils and to give kids like those with autism or ADHD better, quicker support. New rules will also set limits on private special‑school fees."
