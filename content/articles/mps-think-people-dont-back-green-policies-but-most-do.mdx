title: "MPs Think People Don’t Back Green Policies, But Most Do"
summary: "New research found that UK and Belgian MPs think only a few people back climate measures like wind farms or higher petrol taxes. In reality, most voters support these policies. Because MPs underestimate support, they are less likely to vote for or speak up about green plans. Giving MPs the real numbers raised their estimates a bit, but still not enough. Bias from louder conservative voices and climate‑disinformation also skew MPs’ views."
