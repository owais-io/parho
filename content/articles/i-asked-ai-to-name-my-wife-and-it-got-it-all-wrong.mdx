title: "I asked AI to name my wife, and it got it all wrong"
summary: "Martin Rowson, a cartoonist, tried a simple test: he asked an AI about his wife. The AI kept giving wrong answers – names of famous writers, actors, and even people who don’t exist. Each time he rephrased the question, the answer changed. Rowson laughed but also warned that the AI’s mistakes show how unreliable these tools can be when people rely on them for facts."
