title: "Asian Man Wrongfully Arrested After Facial‑Recognition Mix‑Up"
summary: "Alvi Choudhury, a software engineer, was handcuffed and held for nearly ten hours after Thames Valley police mistakenly matched his face to a burglar in Milton Keynes using facial‑recognition software. The match was wrong – the real suspect was younger and looked very different. The case shows a bias in the tech that gives many false matches for black and Asian faces. Choudhury is suing for damages and wants police to be more transparent."
