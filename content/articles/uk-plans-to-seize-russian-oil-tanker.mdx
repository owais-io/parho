title: "UK plans to seize Russian oil tanker"
summary: "The UK is threatening to seize a Russia‑linked oil tanker that smuggles Russian crude under false flags. The move would hurt Moscow, whose oil revenue is already falling because of sanctions. Britain, along with other NATO countries, has identified military options to capture such ships. If a seizure succeeds, the seized oil could be sold to help Ukraine. The action risks a new maritime front with Russia."
