title: "US and Ukraine release new peace plan after critics objected to pro‑Russia terms"
summary: "The US and Ukraine have announced a revised peace framework to end the war with Russia. They rushed to update the plan after European allies published a competing proposal that left out several pro‑Russia points from the original US draft. The new plan keeps Ukraine’s sovereignty, but it still limits its army size and touches on territory issues. Both sides say talks are progressing, while Russia launched a drone attack on Kharkiv amid the negotiations."
