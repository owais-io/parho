title: "Starmer wants Europe to change human‑rights rules to stop the rise of far‑right politics"
summary: "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged European leaders at a summit to modernise the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). He argues the changes would let countries enforce borders and curb far‑right influence. Critics fear it could weaken asylum rights and push refugees toward dangerous routes. Starmer insists the reform balances law, order and compassion, while charities warn it might lead other nations to cut back on protections for vulnerable people."
