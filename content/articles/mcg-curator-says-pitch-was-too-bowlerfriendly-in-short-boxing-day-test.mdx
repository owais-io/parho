title: "MCG Curator Says Pitch Was Too Bowler‑Friendly in Short Boxing Day Test"
summary: "The MCG’s head curator, Matthew Page, admitted the pitch was too bowler‑friendly, causing the Boxing Day Test between Australia and England to finish in just two days. The early finish forced refunds for day‑three tickets and hurt Cricket Australia’s finances. Players and critics complained about the unfair surface, but the club’s chief executive stood by Page. The pitch was meant to give more seam movement but ended up too extreme."
