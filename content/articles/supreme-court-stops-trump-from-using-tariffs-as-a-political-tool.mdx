title: "Supreme Court Stops Trump from Using Tariffs as a Political Tool"
summary: "The Supreme Court ruled that presidents cannot unilaterally impose tariffs to reward donors or allies. Trump had used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to give special tariff breaks to companies that donated money. The court said the President must have clear congressional approval to set tariffs. Trump can still use tariffs, but only under strict laws that prevent favoritism and require broad, non‑discriminatory rules. This limits his ability to use trade as a political tool."
