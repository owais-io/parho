title: "Trump Misunderstands the Monroe Doctrine – Bad Bunny’s Lesson"
summary: "Bad Bunny’s Super‑Bowl halftime show celebrated all of the Americas, but President Trump saw it as an attack on the United States. He has re‑framed the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, calling it the “Donroe Doctrine,” to justify a policy that tries to dominate the whole hemisphere. The original doctrine was actually a pledge of support for Latin American independence and non‑intervention. Trump’s version turns that promise of solidarity into a threat of dominance."
