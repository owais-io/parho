title: "Exercise Can Help Mild Depression and Anxiety"
summary: "Aerobic exercise like running, swimming or dancing can help treat mild depression and anxiety, especially when done in groups. A study of 63 reviews found that young adults and new mothers saw the biggest improvements. Fast‑moving workouts that raise heart rate worked best, while low‑intensity sessions helped anxiety more. Socialising during exercise boosts its antidepressant effect. It can match or even beat usual treatments for mild cases, but it shouldn’t replace therapy for severe depression."
