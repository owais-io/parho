title: "Antarctica Has the Bluest Sky on Earth"
summary: "People often think places like Cape Town or the French Alps have the deepest blue skies, but scientists say Antarctica tops the list. The sky’s blue comes from Rayleigh scattering of sunlight, which is strongest at high altitude and when the air is dry and clean. Antarctica’s high altitude, low humidity, and lack of pollution make its sky a striking sapphire shade. The Atacama desert and Tibetan plateau also get pretty blue, but Antarctica wins."
