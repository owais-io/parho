title: "UK Retail Sales Jump 1.8% in January, Biggest Monthly Rise in Nearly Two Years"
summary: "Retail sales in Great Britain grew 1.8% in January, the biggest monthly jump in almost two years, beating the 0.2% forecast. The rise was led by art, antiques, online jewellery, furniture, tech and fuel sales. Online shopping also rose sharply, up 1.3% month‑on‑month and 14.7% year‑on‑year. Inflation fell to 3% and economists see this as a sign that consumer confidence is easing after a tough end‑2025."
