title: "Why AI Should Not Have Legal Rights"
summary: "AI stories in fiction make us feel it is a friend, but real AI doesn’t have feelings or a mind. Some companies now limit what AI can say to protect “chatbot welfare.” The idea that future AI should get legal rights is still speculative and could distract from real dangers, like abusive content or weaponised drones. Experts say we need technical safety limits, like a shut‑off switch, and careful human‑rights protection. The focus must stay on keeping people safe."
