title: "Ukrainian drone teams fight to keep the line east of Zaporizhzhia"
summary: "Ukrainian drone crews in the 423rd battalion monitor video feeds from the front line east of Zaporizhzhia. They use FPV and commercial drones to spot Russian forces on flat farmland. In November Russia pushed back a few miles, but Ukrainian drones have killed hundreds of soldiers, giving the army a tactical edge. Pilots work long shifts, deal with fog and fatigue, and hope new trainees keep the line holding."
