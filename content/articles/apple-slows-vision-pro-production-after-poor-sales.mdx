title: "Apple Slows Vision Pro Production After Poor Sales"
summary: "Apple is cutting how many Vision Pro headsets it makes because they aren’t selling well. Sales are around 45,000 last quarter, and the $3,499 price is a hard sell. Apple has also cut marketing almost 95 %. With few apps and a heavy, pricey design, the headset is struggling against cheaper Meta Quest units. The company may push a cheaper model and focus more on AI‑powered wearables next, marking a rare flop for Apple."
