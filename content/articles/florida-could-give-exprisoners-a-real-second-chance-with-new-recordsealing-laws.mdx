title: "Florida could give ex‑prisoners a real second chance with new record‑sealing laws"
summary: "Florida ex‑prisoners often struggle to find jobs because their criminal records stay on file. A new law could automatically seal those records, removing barriers and letting people get regular work instead of low‑pay temp jobs. Already, 13 states and DC use this system. Around 6.2 million Floridians have records, so many would benefit. A bill could also bring federal grant money. The state should act."
