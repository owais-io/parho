title: "Arsenal's Corner Game is Turning into Goals"
summary: "Arsenal have become the best at scoring from corners, free‑kicks and penalties. About 30% of Premier League goals come from set‑pieces, and Arsenal’s 17 of 40 league goals this season are from those dead‑balls. They rely on right‑footed Rice and left‑footed Saka to deliver in‑swinging corners into the six‑yard box. The team mixes deliveries, uses tall defenders, and moves players in and out of the box to create chaos. Opponents must change their defense or risk more own‑goals and penalties."
