title: "France‑Germany Jet Plan Collapses Over Leadership Dispute"
summary: "France and Germany started a joint fighter‑jet project called FCAS, but now the deal is in trouble. The two nations disagree on leadership – France’s Dassault wants control, while Germany’s Airbus argues for a shared role. France needs a nuclear‑capable, carrier‑launch jet, Germany does not. With growing political rifts and new defence budgets after the Ukraine war, the project could split into separate jets and hurt Europe’s united defence."
