title: "Why I Love Being a Nun: Prayer and Helping the Poor"
summary: "I’ve been a Franciscan sister for two years and I love that I can mix quiet prayer with hands‑on help. In London I run soup kitchens, shelters, food and housing programs, and use my health‑care background to give medical support to people on the streets. Nuns can live in monasteries or out in the city, and many younger women are now looking to religious life. The article shows how nuns bring both reflection and service to everyday life."
