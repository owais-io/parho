title: "Turkey’s electric car sales now match the EU"
summary: "Turkey’s electric cars now make up almost 17% of new sales, almost matching the EU's 17.4%. Prices are helped by low taxes, so people buy them for money saved on fuel, not just to be green. A local maker, Togg, is leading the market and plans to boost output. But the tax break could vanish, hurting sales. A stable policy could cut oil imports and help the economy."
