title: "Geminid Meteor Shower: When and Where to Catch the Best Night Sky Show in Australia"
summary: "The Geminid meteor shower is one of the brightest annual displays. It peaks on Sunday night and Monday morning, with the clearest view between 3 am and 3:30 am (AEDT). If you’re in northern Australia, like Darwin or Cairns, you could see 80–90 streaks per hour. The fireballs come from dust left by asteroid 3200 Phaethon. To see them best, find a dark spot away from street lights."
