title: "Pauline Hanson's Racism Still Hurts Immigrant Families"
summary: "I grew up as a first‑generation immigrant in rural New South Wales. In the 1990s, Pauline Hanson’s racist speeches made me feel unwelcome. Thirty‑plus years later, One Nation’s rising polls show that the same xenophobic tone is back. I argue that blaming foreigners for jobs and houses masks real economic inequality. The story shows how racism lingers in politics and how many Australians still ignore deeper social problems."
