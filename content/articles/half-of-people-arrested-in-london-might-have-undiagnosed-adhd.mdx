title: "Half of People Arrested in London Might Have Undiagnosed ADHD"
summary: "The study found that about 50% of people recently arrested in London might have ADHD that hasn't been diagnosed, and 5% might have autism. Researchers gave quick screening tests to detainees, and most agreed to be checked. Many who had no known diagnosis scored high. The team says early screening could help police understand behavior better, connect people to support, and reduce wrongful arrests."
