title: "Taliban Stops Girls’ Education, UN Calls for Accountability"
summary: "The Taliban has stopped girls from going to secondary and higher school in Afghanistan, a move the UN says is a crime against humanity. 2.2 million girls have been denied education, while women face bans from work, travel and public life. The U.N. and international courts are pushing for accountability, even issuing ICC arrest warrants, but many countries keep talking with the Taliban, ignoring the girls’ rights. Underground learning and exile schools keep hope alive."
