title: "Reeves Blames Budget Leaks and Says Income Tax Decision Was Made with PM"
summary: "Rachel Reeves says leaks before the budget were unacceptable and that the decision to cancel an income‑tax rise was made together with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. She criticised unauthorized leaks that misled the market, and said the OBR chair had resigned after an early release of documents. Reeves says the government has room to adjust spending or taxes later, but she has already ruled out big cuts and will add new charges on very‑expensive homes and electric vehicles."
