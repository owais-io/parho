title: "Australia lets company cut 3,000 hectares of tropical savanna without environmental review"
summary: "The federal government approved a plan to clear almost 3,000 hectares of tropical savanna in the Northern Territory for cotton and sorghum. The approval skips an environmental assessment under the EPBC Act, sparking outrage from wildlife groups. The land houses threatened species, including the ghost bat and Gouldian finch. The decision was made after a minister said the project wouldn’t have a big impact, but critics say it could destroy habitat for dozens of endangered species."
