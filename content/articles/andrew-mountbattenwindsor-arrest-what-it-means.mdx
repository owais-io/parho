title: "Andrew Mountbatten‑Windsor Arrest: What It Means"
summary: "Prince Andrew, now called Andrew Mountbatten‑Windsor, was arrested on his 66th birthday at Sandringham on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was released soon after. The arrest is the first for a senior royal and may stem from U.S. documents linking him to Epstein, suggesting he might have shared sensitive trade‑envoy information. The offence is weak for high‑profile figures, but the case could open wider investigations and lead to court action."
