title: "Labour Needs a Clear Plan to Save UK Universities"
summary: "UK universities have grown a lot since the 1990s, but a degree now feels more like a chance than a sure job. Rising student debt, tighter loan terms and a shrinking job market mean fewer young people choose university. Cuts to public funding and a new tax on international students are pushing many institutions to the brink. Ministers have released fixes, but no clear overall strategy exists, despite universities' huge economic value."
