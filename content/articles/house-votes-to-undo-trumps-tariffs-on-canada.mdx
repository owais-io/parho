title: "House Votes to Undo Trump’s Tariffs on Canada"
summary: "The U.S. House voted 219‑211 to remove President Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a bipartisan move that signals disapproval of his trade policy. Six Republicans joined Democrats, while most GOP members stayed home or opposed the measure. Trump warned that voting against tariffs could hurt Republicans in upcoming elections. The Senate had already rejected the tariffs, reflecting frustration over high prices and uncertainty from the trade war. The resolution is largely symbolic, as Trump would need to sign or veto it."
