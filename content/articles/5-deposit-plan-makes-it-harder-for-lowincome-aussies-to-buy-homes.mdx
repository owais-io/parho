title: "5% Deposit Plan Makes It Harder for Low‑Income Aussies to Buy Homes"
summary: "Australia’s 5% deposit scheme, meant to help buyers, might actually make it harder for low‑income Aussies to buy homes. New research says the plan could push prices up 10‑20% over the next decade, meaning those with less money could wait up to five years longer. An alternative idea – letting first‑time buyers tap into their superannuation – also raises prices but helps more people buy sooner. More housing supply is the real solution."
