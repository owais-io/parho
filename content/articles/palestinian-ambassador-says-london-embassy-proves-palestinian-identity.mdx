title: "Palestinian ambassador says London embassy proves Palestinian identity"
summary: "Palestinian ambassador Husam Zomlot celebrated the opening of a new embassy in London, saying it proves Palestinians have a recognized state. The UK last month officially recognized Palestine, making the embassy more than a building. The ceremony drew MPs, ambassadors, and the public, but earlier the site was vandalised with pro‑Israel stickers. Zomlot also highlighted the suffering in Gaza, where over 400 people have died, and a young refugee in the UK hopes to become an ambassador someday."
