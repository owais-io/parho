title: "Australia Still Missing a National Gun Register – Could It Have Stopped the Bondi Shooting?"
summary: "Australia still lacks a national gun registry that would let police and intelligence track firearms in real time. After the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, law‑enforcement leaders pushed for it, but the project is nearly 30 years overdue. The missing system could have flagged the Bondi attacker, Sajid Akram, who had a licence and six guns. New reforms aim to limit gun ownership, speed up the registry, and introduce a buy‑back scheme."
