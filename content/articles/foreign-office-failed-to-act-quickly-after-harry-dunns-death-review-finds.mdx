title: "Foreign Office failed to act quickly after Harry Dunn’s death, review finds"
summary: "An independent review said Britain’s Foreign Office missed chances to help the family of 19‑year‑old Harry Dunn, who died in a 2019 crash near a U.S. base. Officials were slow to act, told the U.S. that the driver’s wife could leave, and didn’t update police or the family about the move. Poor communication led to a sad meeting with the foreign secretary. The report calls for better early action."
