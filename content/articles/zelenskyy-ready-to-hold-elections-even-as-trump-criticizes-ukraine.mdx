title: "Zelenskyy Ready to Hold Elections Even as Trump Criticizes Ukraine"
summary: "Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, says he's ready to hold a wartime election in the next few months if Parliament and allies agree. He was annoyed when former U.S. President Donald Trump said Ukraine wasn't a true democracy. Zelenskyy said the decision belongs to Ukrainians, not outsiders, and asked the U.S. and Europe for help keeping elections safe. Opponents warn it could hurt the war effort, and legal rules still block elections during martial law."
