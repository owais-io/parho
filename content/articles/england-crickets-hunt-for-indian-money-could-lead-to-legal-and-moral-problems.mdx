title: "England Cricket’s Hunt for Indian Money Could Lead to Legal and Moral Problems"
summary: "The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is trying to raise money by selling stakes in its new Hundred franchise to Indian owners. That deal could push the team to leave out Pakistani players, a practice seen in other Indian‑owned leagues. If the ECB ignores the rights of Pakistani cricketers, it could face discrimination lawsuits under the Equality Act 2010. The move also clashes with the ECB’s stated goal of making cricket more inclusive."
