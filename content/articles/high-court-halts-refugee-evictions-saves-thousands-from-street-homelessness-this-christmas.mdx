title: "High Court Halts Refugee Evictions, Saves Thousands from Street Homelessness This Christmas"
summary: "A UK high court stopped the Home Office from evicting thousands of new refugees. The ruling requires the government to give them 56 days, not 28, to find new homes before moving on. The decision helps about 3,000 people avoid ending up on the streets this Christmas. The order only covers those who are still in government housing, not people who have already been evicted. Many charities say the 28‑day period was too short."
