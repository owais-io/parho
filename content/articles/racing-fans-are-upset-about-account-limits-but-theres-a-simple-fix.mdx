title: "Racing Fans Are Upset About Account Limits, But There’s a Simple Fix"
summary: "UK horse‑race punters are frustrated when bookmakers shut or limit their accounts, especially when they try to place small but smart bets. In Australia a “minimum bet rule” forces bookmakers to accept bets above a certain value, keeping punters in the legal market. UK bookies say it hurts bonuses, but the rule could stop people moving to illegal sites. The Gambling Commission now has funding to tackle this problem and could adopt the rule."
