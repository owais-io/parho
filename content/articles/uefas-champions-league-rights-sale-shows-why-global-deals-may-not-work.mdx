title: "UEFA's Champions League rights sale shows why global deals may not work"
summary: "UEFA raised Champions League rights prices by over 20% across the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and France, with Paramount winning the UK, Germany and Italy rights. The planned single global package failed; Amazon secured separate deals in three markets while Canal+ and Movistar won the rest. The auction proves that selling rights market‑by‑market still brings more money and flexibility."
