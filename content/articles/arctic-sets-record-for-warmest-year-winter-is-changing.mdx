summary: "From Oct 2024 to Sept 2025 the Arctic was the hottest in 125 years and saw the lowest sea‑ice cover on record. Scientists say this warmer, wetter climate is turning winter into a warmer season, with rain falling on snow and making it harder for animals and people. The Greenland ice sheet shed 129 bn tons, adding to rising sea levels. Melting ice also changes fisheries, affecting communities far beyond the Arctic."
