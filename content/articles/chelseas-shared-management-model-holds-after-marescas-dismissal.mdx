title: "Chelsea’s Shared Management Model Holds After Maresca’s Dismissal"
summary: "Chelsea keep their unique management style even after firing head coach Enzo Maresca. Instead of one boss, the club runs on a team of sporting directors who make decisions together. Maresca’s short stint was a test of that system, but it didn’t prove it was broken. The club still believes in building slowly, using data and teamwork, and will look for another permanent coach when the time comes. Stability remains a priority."
