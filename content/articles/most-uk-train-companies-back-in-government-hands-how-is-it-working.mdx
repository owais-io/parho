title: "Most UK Train Companies Back in Government Hands – How Is It Working?"
summary: "Since Labour won the 2024 election, most of Britain’s main train companies have gone back to state control. The government plans to finish this by 2027 and is creating a new body called Great British Railways to run services and tracks together. Early results show better on‑time trains for some operators, but costs are still high and some services haven’t improved. Critics say nationalisation alone may not fix everything."
