title: "Colombian rebels tell civilians to stay home during drills after Trump’s threats"
summary: "The ELN, a Colombian guerrilla group, told people in its areas to stay indoors for three days while it holds training exercises. They said the exercises were a response to President Trump’s warning that countries producing and selling cocaine to the U.S. could be attacked. Trump’s comment added to growing tension between the U.S. and Colombia, especially as the U.S. also pressures Venezuela. The ELN has thousands of fighters and controls drug‑producing regions, and past peace talks have fallen apart."
