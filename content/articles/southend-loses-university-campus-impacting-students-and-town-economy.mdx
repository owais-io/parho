title: "Southend Loses University Campus, Impacting Students and Town Economy"
summary: "Essex University will shut its Southend campus this summer after a drop in international students. The closure will affect about 800 students and many staff. Town shops, cafés and bars that rely on student spending will lose customers. Students will have to travel two hours each way to Colchester, a journey that many cannot afford or fit into their work and family life. The town feels a loss of hope and opportunity."
