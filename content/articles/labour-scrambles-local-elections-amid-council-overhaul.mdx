title: "Labour scrambles local elections amid council overhaul"
summary: "Labour tried to postpone England’s local elections to prepare for a big council re‑organisation, but changed its mind with less than three months left. The move sparked criticism that it was political manipulation and caused chaos for the Electoral Commission and election staff. The plan is to replace two‑tier councils with single unitary authorities, a move tested first in Surrey. The reversal has raised doubts about the party’s competence and the future of local democracy."
