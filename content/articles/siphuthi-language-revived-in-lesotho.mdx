title: "SiPhuthi Language Revived in Lesotho"
summary: "Linguists from Hamburg and South Africa have helped the small siPhuthi language, spoken by only a few thousand people, make a comeback. They recorded healers, poems, and everyday stories, taught people how to write it, and are translating the Bible into siPhuthi. The language is now officially recognized in Lesotho, and teachers can let children use it in school instead of being punished for speaking it."
