title: "Experts Question New SEND Reform Plan"
summary: "The Guardian letters section shows strong concerns about England’s new special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) white paper. Critics say the plan’s “cost‑neutral” ideas, like sensory circuits and calm clubs, actually need paid staff and will strain already thin resources. They highlight a chronic teacher and specialist shortage, slow and adversarial EHCP paperwork, and a need for real funding and inclusive teaching methods rather than more specialist placements."
