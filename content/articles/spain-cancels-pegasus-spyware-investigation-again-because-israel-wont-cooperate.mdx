title: "Spain Cancels Pegasus Spyware Investigation Again Because Israel Won’t Cooperate"
summary: "Spain’s top court has shut down its probe into Israeli‑made Pegasus spyware that targeted senior ministers, including the prime minister, again because Israel refused to give requested information. The judge said the case can’t move forward without cooperation, violating international law and good‑faith principles. France’s data helped reopen the case once, but it didn’t pin anyone down. The investigation remains stalled while officials seek new evidence."
