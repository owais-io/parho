title: "Some See Bruce Lehrmann as an Inspiration, Even While His Legal Cases Fail"
summary: "Bruce Lehrmann has made headlines for suing media outlets and a former senator. His lawyer says he shows others who feel wrongly accused how to fight back. But his fights have also backfired, with courts ruling against him and large costs left unpaid. Although he’s won some settlements, many see him as a joke. He still wants help from the government and may take his fight to the High Court."
