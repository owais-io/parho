title: "The Climate Crisis Threatens Us, Not the Earth"
summary: "The climate crisis is a real threat to people, not just the planet. It shows that the Earth can survive, but humans and many species may not. The problem is moral and unequal: poor countries, which did little to cause it, suffer most, while rich ones delay action for profit. We need honest, brave politics and adaptation funds— not charity. Nuclear plants in flood‑prone areas also risk danger."
