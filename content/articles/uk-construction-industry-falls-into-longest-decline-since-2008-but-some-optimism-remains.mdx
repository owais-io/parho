title: "UK construction industry falls into longest decline since 2008, but some optimism remains"
summary: "UK construction output has been shrinking for a year straight, the longest slump since the 2008 crisis. The PMI is below 50, meaning firms are losing work, especially in housebuilding which hit a low not seen since early COVID. Though companies feel a bit more hopeful after the budget, worries about slow demand and high costs keep growth modest. The government aims to build 1.5 million homes, but many builders doubt it will be reached."
