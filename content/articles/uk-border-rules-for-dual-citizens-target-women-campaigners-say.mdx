title: "UK Border Rules for Dual Citizens Target Women, Campaigners Say"
summary: "From 25 Feb, British dual nationals must carry a UK passport or a costly certificate when flying, taking a ferry or train to the UK. Campaigners say the rule is unfair to women in Greece and Spain, where name‑matching rules on passports differ after marriage. They argue the new law will force women to pay up to £600 for a document or risk being denied boarding, while the Home Office says exceptions are possible but hard to get."
