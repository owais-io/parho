title: "Myles Garrett is close to breaking the NFL's sack record"
summary: "Myles Garrett is almost breaking the NFL's record for most sacks in a season. With 21.5 sacks in 14 games, he could finish the season with 26, surpassing Michael Strahan's long‑time record. He’s doing this on a struggling Browns team that rarely leads, which makes his numbers even more impressive. Garrett has been the focus of every offensive game plan, but he keeps getting sacks. His season is a historic individual performance that may not translate into a winning team."
