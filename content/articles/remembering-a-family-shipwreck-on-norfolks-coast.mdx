summary: "He walked from Cley to Blakeney Point to visit his great‑great‑grandfather, who owned a 700‑year shipping company. Now there is a rusting steamer, the Yankee, abandoned on a spit of shingle. A redwing bird lands nearby, connecting past and present. He reflects on family history, the ship’s decay, and the quiet beauty of the coast. He also notes how the sea plant lingers and how the wind carries memories of old sailors."
