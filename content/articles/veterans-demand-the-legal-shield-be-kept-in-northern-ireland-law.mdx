title: "Veterans Demand the Legal Shield Be Kept in Northern Ireland Law"
summary: "Veteran groups in the UK are shouting against the government’s plan to drop a legal immunity that protects former soldiers from being sued for actions taken during Northern Ireland’s Troubles. The immunity was part of the Legacy Act, which the previous government had removed after court rulings. MPs will vote this week on a motion to keep the clause. The prime minister says the change satisfies human‑rights rules while shielding veterans, but opponents fear it lets lawsuits keep coming."
