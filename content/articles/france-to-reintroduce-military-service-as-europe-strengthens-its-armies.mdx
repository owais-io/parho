title: "France to Re‑introduce Military Service as Europe Strengthens Its Armies"
summary: "France plans to bring back voluntary military service to grow its army, a move part of a wider European push to beef up defence amid Russia’s threat and doubts about US support. Many EU countries debate conscription, with the Nordics, Baltics and Finland keeping drafts, while Sweden, Denmark and others have mixed models. Voluntary forces are seen as more professional but cost more, while conscripts boost numbers and reserve pools. Public opinion favours some form of service, but it remains a sensitive social debate."
