title: "U.S. to Step Back in North Korea Defense"
summary: "The Pentagon says it will play a smaller part in keeping North Korea in check, leaving most of the responsibility to South Korea. South Korea already hosts 28,000 U.S. troops and has raised its defense budget. The move is meant to free American forces for other missions, like Taiwan or China. Seoul worries the change could weaken the alliance. The plan also skips the goal of removing North Korea’s nuclear weapons."
