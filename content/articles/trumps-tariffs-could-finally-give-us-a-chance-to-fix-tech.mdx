title: "Trump’s tariffs could finally give us a chance to fix tech"
summary: "Trump’s new tariffs could finally break the rule that keeps people stuck with U.S. tech companies. For 25 years, the EFF has tried to stop laws that prevent users from fixing or customizing devices. Those rules let firms collect huge fees and control data. The tariffs weaken the U.S. trade power that enforced those laws, giving activists, investors and tech makers a chance to reverse‑engineer products, create open alternatives, and protect privacy."
