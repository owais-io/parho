title: "Australia Must Act Now to Cut Fossil Fuels, Say Climate Activists"
summary: "Australia signed a climate deal at the Cop30 summit, pledging to phase out coal, gas and oil. Critics say the government still plans new fossil‑fuel projects and keeps subsidies, so activists want concrete action. Prime Minister Albanese said renewables are cheapest but avoided questions on future gas fields. Greenpeace and climate groups demand Australia stop new projects, cut exports, and act fast to keep the world below 1.5°C. Australia’s climate minister will lead talks at next year’s Cop31."
