summary: "Banijay, the big TV producer behind shows like MasterChef, is talking to merge with All3Media, the UK company that made The Traitors, Midsomer Murders, and Call the Midwife. The deal would create one of the largest TV production groups in Europe, but it would face competition checks. The talks are still early, and no final decision has been made.
