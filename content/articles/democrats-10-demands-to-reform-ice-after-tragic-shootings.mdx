title: "Democrats’ 10 Demands to Reform ICE After Tragic Shootings"
summary: "After federal agents fatally shot two Americans in Minneapolis, Democrats are demanding changes to how ICE operates. They want agents to get a warrant before entering private homes, stop random arrests, verify a person’s citizenship before detaining them, and keep them on the lookout for use‑of‑force violations. The bill would also require visible IDs, body cameras, limits near schools and hospitals, and better state‑local oversight. The aim is to prevent more deaths and protect civil rights."
