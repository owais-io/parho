title: "Trump Stops Visas for 75 Countries to Keep the U.S. White"
summary: "Trump’s visa ban blocks applications from 75 countries, claiming they’re likely to become a public charge – a false claim, since most immigrants use welfare less than Americans and pay more taxes. The list mirrors the 1924 immigration law that used racial quotas to keep the US white. Trump’s language and policies repeat that racist rule, aiming to keep America ‘white’ and exclude non‑whites. The ban costs billions but is driven by racial goals, not economics."
