title: "Letters: Young voters, driving test stories, rail, and politics"
summary: "A quick letter roundup shows readers from towns like Mansfield, Derby, and Swindon sharing short notes on topics ranging from why young voters might back Reform UK to personal anecdotes about driving tests, rail services, and global politics. The editor suggests asking more everyday young people in red‑wall areas for their thoughts instead of a small, selective panel. Readers are encouraged to send their own brief replies for possible publication."
