summary: "Survey of 27,000 workers in 35 countries shows 27% of UK employees worry AI could erase their jobs in five years. Two‑thirds of employers have used AI in the last year, and more than half say the tech is now common at work. Many feel AI benefits companies more than staff, especially younger workers. While 55% say AI boosts productivity, almost one in five think it won’t change their job much, creating a gap between employee and employer expectations."
