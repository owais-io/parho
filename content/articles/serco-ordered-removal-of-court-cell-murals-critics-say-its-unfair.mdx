title: "Serco Ordered Removal of Court Cell Murals, Critics Say It’s Unfair"
summary: "Serco was accused of tearing down brightly coloured murals in court cells that were meant to lift spirits. The Lay Observers report says the contractor removed the art after instructions from its bosses, calling the move “petty and vindictive.” The report also flags other problems, such as long transport times, mixing men and women or children with adults, and staff shouting at detainees. Critics say the art could reduce self‑harm and should stay."
