title: "Ireland miss top backs Bundee Aki and Hugo Keenan before Six Nations opener"
summary: "Ireland will start the Six Nations without two of their top backs, Bundee Aki and Hugo Keenan. Aki is out for six games after a suspension for abusing officials, while Keenan is doubtful with a broken thumb. Both were expected to play against France in Paris, so the coach has to pick replacements, making the team weaker. Ireland’s injury woes also mean the squad will face a tough opener."
