title: "Cop30 Deal: Big Steps but Not Enough, No Fossil‑Fuel Plan"
summary: "The 194‑country climate summit in Belém produced a deal that keeps the Paris goal alive, but it falls short of what many hoped for. Rich countries agreed to triple the money for climate‑adaptation, but the deadline was pushed back to 2034. A “just transition” plan was adopted to protect workers and Indigenous people, yet no firm plan to cut fossil fuels was included. Brazil and a coalition of other nations will work outside the UN to push a fossil‑fuel exit and a separate forest‑protection fund."
