title: "Glyphosate Found on UK Playgrounds, Raising Child Safety Concerns"
summary: "Scientists testing 13 playgrounds in England and London found traces of the weedkiller glyphosate, a chemical linked to cancer, on equipment and in the soil. Only one area, Hackney, had no residues because it banned glyphosate in 2021. The discovery worries parents, because children touch surfaces and put hands in mouths. Local councils still use glyphosate in parks, but lawmakers may tighten rules soon."
