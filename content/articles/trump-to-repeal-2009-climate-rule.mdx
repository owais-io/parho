title: "Trump to Repeal 2009 Climate Rule"
summary: "Trump and the EPA want to cancel the 2009 rule that says carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health. The move could cut costs for companies but critics say it will raise health risks and future climate damage. Environmental groups plan to sue the agency. The repeal would mainly affect car and truck emissions, not power plants, but it still removes the legal basis for many climate rules."
