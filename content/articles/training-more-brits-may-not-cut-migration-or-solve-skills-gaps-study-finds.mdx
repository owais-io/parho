title: "Training More Brits May Not Cut Migration or Solve Skills Gaps, Study Finds"
summary: "A study by Oxford’s Migration Observatory finds that the UK’s plan to force employers to train British workers instead of hiring overseas staff is unlikely to lower net migration or fill skill shortages. The report says low pay and poor conditions keep many locals from certain jobs, while migrants arriving on student, family or other visas still have work rights. Because of this, the training push may not solve the problems it aims to address."
