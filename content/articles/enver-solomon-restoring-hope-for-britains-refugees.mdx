title: "Enver Solomon: Restoring Hope for Britain’s Refugees"
summary: "I wrote a letter about Enver Solomon, who led the Refugee Council and helped refugees. I feel frustrated with recent governments and lost faith in the Labour Party. I now see that compassionate people like Solomon bring hope. He makes me believe Britain still has good people. My family, including my Punjabi daughter‑in‑law and seven grandchildren, shows that diversity is welcome. His work reminds us that not all politicians care, but dedicated individuals do."
