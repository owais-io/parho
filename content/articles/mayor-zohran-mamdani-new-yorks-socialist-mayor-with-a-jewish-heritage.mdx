title: "Mayor Zohran Mamdani: New York’s Socialist Mayor With a Jewish Heritage"
summary: "Zohran Mamdani became New York City’s first socialist mayor, but he didn’t come from a blank slate. His family and many of his supporters trace back to Jewish workers who built a Yiddish‑socialist movement in the city’s Lower East Side. Despite attacks from wealthy donors and accusations of antisemitism, Mamdani shows that his politics are rooted in that tradition of labor activism and community organizing. He earned strong support, especially from younger Jews, by focusing on everyday needs like affordable housing, childcare, and public transit."
