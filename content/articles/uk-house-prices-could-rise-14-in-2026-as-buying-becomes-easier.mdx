title: "UK house prices could rise 1‑4% in 2026 as buying becomes easier"
summary: "In 2026, most experts say UK house prices will grow by about 1‑4 %. Halifax expects 1‑3 %, while Nationwide sees up to 4 %. The rise comes as wages grow, interest rates fall and mortgage rules are being loosened to help first‑time buyers and self‑employed people. New rules from the FCA aim to give more flexible mortgages, and Rightmove also expects a small price jump. The market is steadier after last year’s slowdowns."
