title: "Liberal Party’s Trump‑style Push Won’t Win Australian Cities"
summary: "The Liberal Party is shifting to right‑wing, populist tactics—like those used by Trump, Farage and One Nation—to try to keep power. But the move alienates big, multicultural cities and misses voters who want clear economic and social plans. The party offers little on housing, climate or health, and its new leaders are seen as lazy and too busy with social‑media noise. Without fresh policies, the Liberals risk losing support among young and diverse voters."
