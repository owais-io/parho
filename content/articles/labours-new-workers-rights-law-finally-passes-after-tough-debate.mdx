title: "Labour's new workers' rights law finally passes after tough debate"
summary: "After a hard fight in the House of Lords, Labour’s bill that gives workers stronger rights—like guaranteed hours, better pay for sudden shift cancellations, and more leave—will become law next week. The law still drops an instant unfair‑dismissal protection but keeps a higher compensation cap. Trade unions celebrate the win, while Conservatives say it will raise costs for small firms. The new rules should start in April, but some worries about implementation remain."
