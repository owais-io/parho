title: "Law Minister Says Cutting Jury Trials Could Clear Court Backlog in a Decade"
summary: "Law Minister David Lammy says cutting jury trials could clear the 80,000‑case backlog in England and Wales in a decade. He wants to let many offenders face a single judge instead of a jury, like Canada does, and raise magistrates’ sentencing limits to 18 months. The plan would stop jury trials for sentences under three years. Some Labour MPs and lawyers worry it could hurt fairness and need more funding."
