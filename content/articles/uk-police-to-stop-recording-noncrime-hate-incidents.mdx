title: "UK Police to Stop Recording Non‑Crime Hate Incidents"
summary: "UK police leaders say the current way of logging non‑crime hate incidents is outdated and should be replaced. They want to stop putting these cases on crime records and instead use a simple “commonsense” approach that focuses on serious antisocial behaviour. The review will be sent to the Home Secretary in January. The move follows a decision to drop investigations into non‑crime hate, after high‑profile cases like Father Ted writer Graham Linehan."
