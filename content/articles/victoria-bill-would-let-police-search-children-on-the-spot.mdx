title: "Victoria Bill Would Let Police Search Children on the Spot"
summary: "A new bill in Victoria would let police search children and people with intellectual disabilities right there, without needing a parent or independent adult, in areas like the CBD and major transport hubs. It also would let police search people with an electronic wand or pat‑down in those zones. Human‑rights groups worry the changes could target kids and marginalised people, while the government says it saves time. The bill will be debated in the upper house."
