title: "Trump’s Iran Strikes: A Political Diversion, Not a Real Strategy"
summary: "Trump’s new attacks on Iran look like a show to distract Americans from his own scandals. He’s using the news cycle, not careful strategy, to keep attention on foreign conflict while ignoring how dangerous it could be. The move risks a messy war that could hurt Europe, pull in neighbours, and create refugees. It also weakens US credibility and pulls allies away, making America less able to handle other global challenges."
