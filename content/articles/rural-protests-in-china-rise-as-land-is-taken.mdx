title: "Rural protests in China rise as land is taken"
summary: "In China, the number of rural protests has jumped by 70% this year. Villagers are upset because local governments are taking their farmland for development or demolishing temples. Many protest because they lost jobs and hopes after moving to cities, then returning to find little work. Debt‑heavy local officials often seize land to raise money, while migrants return home with high expectations. The government is setting up community centres to try to calm tensions."
