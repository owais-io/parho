title: "The Kelo Tree: A Dead Tree That Stays Upright"
summary: "The kelo tree is a dead standing tree that can last for centuries. In Attingham Park, a 300‑year‑old Scots pine has lost its bark but still stands tall. The lack of bark lets special blue‑stain fungi colonise the wood, protecting it from rot. Its heartwood, rich in natural resins, resists decay and provides a rare habitat for fungi that are disappearing elsewhere. The tree’s endurance supports biodiversity even after it falls."
