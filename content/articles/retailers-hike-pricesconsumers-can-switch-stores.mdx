title: "Retailers Hike Prices—Consumers Can Switch Stores"
summary: "The Reserve Bank of Australia’s deputy governor urged shoppers to “vote with their feet” by changing where they buy goods to fight unfair price hikes and shrinkflation. He said price rises are spread across many sectors, not just supermarkets, and that the bank will keep raising rates to curb inflation. While higher rates help curb spending, they also strain household budgets and widen inequality."
