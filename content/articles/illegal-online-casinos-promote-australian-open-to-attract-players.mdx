title: "Illegal Online Casinos Promote Australian Open to Attract Players"
summary: "Offshore online casinos are using the Australian Open tennis tournament to advertise their illegal gambling sites. One site, Vegastars, offered free front‑row tickets and a $500 flight voucher, even though the tournament isn’t linked to them. Australian regulators say these sites are unlicensed, so players can’t rely on consumer protection or guarantee payouts. Authorities can block sites and are calling for stricter rules and payment bans to stop the problem."
