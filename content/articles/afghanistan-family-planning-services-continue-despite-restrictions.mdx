title: "Afghanistan: Family Planning Services Continue Despite Restrictions"
summary: "Afghan women still get family‑planning help even after the Taliban banned birth control. A local drug company, DKT Afghanistan, works inside villages and cities, using trusted shops, clinics and midwives. In 2024 they helped almost 70,000 people, giving 40,000 family‑planning options, stopping 298,000 unwanted pregnancies and preventing 340 mothers’ deaths. It shows progress can happen, but rights abuses still loom. International help is slipping, so local efforts are crucial."
