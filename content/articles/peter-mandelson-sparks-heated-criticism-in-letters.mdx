summary: "The letters show critics accusing Mandelson of hypocrisy and of wanting Jeremy Corbyn out of office, suggesting his comments should cost him his Labour seat. They also claim Keir Starmer is a bad politician, compare him to Tony Blair, and wonder if Mandelson broke the law. Some writers question other scandals, like a suspicious osteopathy exam and the Epstein case. It's a collection of hostile opinions."
