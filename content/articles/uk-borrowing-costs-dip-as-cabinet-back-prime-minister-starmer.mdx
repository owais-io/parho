title: "UK Borrowing Costs Dip as Cabinet Back Prime Minister Starmer"
summary: "UK borrowing costs fell back after cabinet ministers said they backed Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Earlier in the day yields rose because staff had quit over Starmer’s choice of Peter Mandelson for Washington. The 10‑year bond hit a 2‑month high, but when ministers like David Lammy and Rachel Reeves voiced support, the rates dropped. The pound stayed steady and investors are not panicking over UK politics. This shows markets are still confident in the UK's fiscal outlook."
