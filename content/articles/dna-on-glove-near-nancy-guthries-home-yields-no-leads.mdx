title: "DNA on Glove Near Nancy Guthrie’s Home Yields No Leads"
summary: "Police searched a glove found about two miles from 84‑year‑old Nancy Guthrie’s house. The glove matched the one seen in surveillance footage of her abductor, but the DNA on it didn’t match anyone in the FBI database or anyone in her home.
