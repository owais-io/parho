summary: "Sanctions are often presented as a way to pressure governments, but in reality they hurt ordinary people. The article explains how trade bans, frozen assets and travel limits in places like Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Haiti have slowed growth, raised poverty, and even forced people to leave their homes. Even Iran faces huge losses from oil and banking rules. The author argues that sanctions work like a long‑term siege, hurting the economy and making life harder for everyday citizens."
