title: "Japan Plans to Boost Nuclear Power and Renewables"
summary: "Japan’s new energy plan says it will use more nuclear power—about 20 % of electricity by 2040—while also boosting renewables to 40–50 % of the mix. The country opened its biggest on‑shore wind farm in Fukushima and is running new nuclear reactors after the 2011 disaster. Local projects use wind, geothermal and solar to supply towns and fish farms. Critics say Japan still relies too much on fossil fuels, but emissions fell 4 % in 2024."
