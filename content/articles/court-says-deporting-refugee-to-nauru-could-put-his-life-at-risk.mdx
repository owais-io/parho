title: "Court says deporting refugee to Nauru could put his life at risk"
summary: "An Iranian man in Australian detention is fighting a deportation order that would send him to the Pacific island of Nauru. His lawyers say he could die there because of severe asthma, bad weather and poor medical facilities. The government insists it has the right to deport non‑citizens and argues the deal with Nauru is legal. The case could challenge a $2.5 billion‑plus agreement and the new laws that cut rights for people being sent away."
