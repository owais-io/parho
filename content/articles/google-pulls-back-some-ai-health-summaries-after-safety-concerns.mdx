title: "Google Pulls Back Some AI Health Summaries After Safety Concerns"
summary: "Google pulled back some AI health summaries after a Guardian investigation found the information could mislead patients. The tool, called Overviews, gave wrong normal ranges for liver blood tests and other questions, putting people at risk. Google removed the summaries for those liver queries but still keeps similar ones for other health topics. Doctors and health groups say Google must keep improving the tool and link to trustworthy sources. More oversight is needed."
