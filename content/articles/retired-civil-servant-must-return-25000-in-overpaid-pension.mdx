title: "Retired civil servant must return £25,000 in overpaid pension"
summary: "Derek Ritchie, a 63‑year‑old former civil servant, was told that his pension payments were wrong for years and he now owes £25,000. The mistake was discovered in 2014, but the paperwork only hit him in March. He says the debt will force him to work again and has worsened his depression and anxiety. The issue is part of a wider problem with the outsourced pension scheme, which is now being run by Capita after criticism of the former manager."
