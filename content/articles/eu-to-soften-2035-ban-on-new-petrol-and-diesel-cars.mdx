title: "EU to soften 2035 ban on new petrol and diesel cars"
summary: "The EU has decided to relax its rule that all new cars sold from 2035 must be zero‑emission. Instead of 100% electric, the limit will drop to 90%, allowing a mix of hybrids and even some combustion engines. The remaining 10% must meet extra green standards, like using green steel or biofuels. The move follows pressure from car makers and several EU leaders, sparking protests from environmental groups who fear it slows Europe’s shift to clean transport."
