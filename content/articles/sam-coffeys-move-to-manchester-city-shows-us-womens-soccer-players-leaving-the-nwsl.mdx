title: "Sam Coffey’s Move to Manchester City Shows US Women’s Soccer Players Leaving the NWSL"
summary: "Sam Coffey, a key player for the US Women’s National Team, has signed with Manchester City from the Portland Thorns. Her move shows that many top US players are now choosing European clubs, leaving only a few on NWSL rosters. The shift hurts the domestic league because it can’t match the money or prestige of clubs like Manchester City or Chelsea. US Soccer’s reduced control over the NWSL and new rules make it harder for the league to keep talent."
