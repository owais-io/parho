summary: "Loma Bropho, a single Noongar and Yamatji mother, has spent two years moving from car to hotel, hoping to secure a rental for her six children in Perth. Her struggle highlights a bigger problem: Indigenous Australians face an uncoordinated housing system, with only 13 % of public‑housing users linked to community‑controlled providers. A recent study says unmet housing needs for low‑income Indigenous families will rise, and governments claim to be working together but still lack clear plans and funding."
