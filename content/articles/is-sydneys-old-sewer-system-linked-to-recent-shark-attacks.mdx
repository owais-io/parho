title: "Is Sydney’s old sewer system linked to recent shark attacks?"
summary: "After four shark attacks in Sydney in 48 hours, people wondered if the city’s old sewer system was a factor. Experts say heavy rain, warm water and low‑visibility conditions can pull bull sharks into coastal areas. Sydney’s primary‑treatment sewer, with many old pipes, can release nutrients that feed the food chain. While no clear link is proven, the city is upgrading its network to improve water quality."
