title: "UK Cuts foreign‑student target, pushes universities to open overseas hubs"
summary: "UK ministers have scrapped the goal of recruiting 600,000 international students each year. Instead, they want universities to open campuses abroad and aim to grow UK education exports to £40 billion a year by 2030. The plan includes tougher rules to ensure real students, and universities could lose licences if they fail. While still welcoming study‑visitors, the focus is on expanding UK schools overseas."
