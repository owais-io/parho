title: "Britain Still Prefers French Over Spanish in Schools"
summary: "Britain still teaches more French than Spanish in schools, even though Spanish is spoken by many more people worldwide. Only 26 % of primary schools offer Spanish, while 70 % offer French. Last year, more students chose Spanish for GCSEs than French, but schools haven’t kept up. Experts say kids learn languages better before age 12 and Spanish gives better job and travel chances, especially after Brexit. Schools should offer Spanish as much as French."
