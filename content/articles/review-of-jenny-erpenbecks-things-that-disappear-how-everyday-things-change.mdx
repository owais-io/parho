title: "Review of Jenny Erpenbeck’s “Things That Disappear” – How Everyday Things Change"
summary: "Jenny Erpenbeck’s new book is a collection of short pieces that started as newspaper columns. She takes ordinary items—like a simple pastry or a coffee spill‑trap—and turns them into reflections on how life, history, and people change after big events, like the fall of the Berlin Wall. By looking at small, everyday changes, she explores memory, loss, and the idea that disappearance isn’t just a quiet ending but a transformation."
