title: "Remote Outback Pub Loses Beer Licence and Must Fix Many Problems to Reopen"
summary: "The Barrow Creek Hotel, a 37‑year‑old outback pub 200km from Alice Springs, lost its beer licence on 1 January after a liquor commission review. Inspectors found problems such as broken toilets, unsafe wiring, serving Indigenous customers through a hatch and not using the government‑issued cards correctly. The commission said the owner, Les Pilton, was not a fit licence holder and set a list of fixes—extra space, upgraded kitchen, food licence, and better communication—before the pub can reopen."
