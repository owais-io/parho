title: "What Happened at Ukraine Peace Talks in Berlin and What’s Next?"
summary: "Berlin meeting between US, Ukraine, and European leaders aimed to find a peace deal. They drafted security guarantees: a European‑led force, US monitoring, EU membership support, limits on Ukrainian troop size, and reconstruction funds. European leaders were positive, but Russia might reject troops and key terms. Major sticking points are the occupied territory and whether Ukraine will cede land. Zelenskyy said Ukraine will not accept any surrender of its land, so the talks remain uncertain."
