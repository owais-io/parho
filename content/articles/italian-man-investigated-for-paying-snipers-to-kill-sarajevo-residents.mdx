title: "Italian Man Investigated for Paying Snipers to Kill Sarajevo Residents"
summary: "The investigation in Milan has named an 80‑year‑old former truck driver as the first suspect. Prosecutors say he allegedly paid Bosnian Serb soldiers to take him and other foreigners to the hills around Sarajevo in the 1990s, where they would shoot civilians during the city’s four‑year siege. The case stems from a writer’s research and a documentary that claim “sniper tourists” were paid for pleasure kills. Serbian veterans deny the claims."
