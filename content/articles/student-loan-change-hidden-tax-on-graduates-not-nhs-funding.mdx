title: "Student Loan Change: Hidden Tax on Graduates, Not NHS Funding"
summary: "Martin Lewis criticised the government for keeping the student‑loan repayment threshold the same, saying it’s like a tax on graduates. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the move would free money to cut NHS waiting lists, but experts say the extra money comes from students, not a new tax. The plan mainly affects “Plan 2” borrowers, who already pay a high combined rate on earnings over £30,000. Public anger is rising, with many graduates calling for debt relief."
