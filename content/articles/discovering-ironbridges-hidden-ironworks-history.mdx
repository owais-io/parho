title: "Discovering Ironbridge's Hidden Ironworks History"
summary: "I spent a weekend wandering Ironbridge, Somerset, a town full of abandoned iron factories that are now covered in trees. A huge information board explains how the area used to make tools like shovels and sickles. I learned that many workers died young from the harsh jobs. The walk felt like a trip back to my father’s time filing tools. I found a piece of iron and felt the weight of history."
