title: "UK Business Secretary Supports Switch to Clean Electric Arc Furnaces at British Steel"
summary: "Peter Kyle, the UK business secretary, says the government wants British Steel at Scunthorpe to switch from blast furnaces to electric arc furnaces. The move could keep the plant running and help the country hit net‑zero goals, but it may mean jobs that blast furnaces bring could be lost. The government has spent a lot of money to keep the plant open and plans a new steel strategy for December. Workers will watch closely, hoping for a fair transition."
