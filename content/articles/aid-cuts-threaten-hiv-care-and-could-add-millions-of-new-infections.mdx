title: "Aid Cuts Threaten HIV Care and Could Add Millions of New Infections"
summary: "Aid cuts from the US and UK have hurt HIV services across Africa. Clinics have shut, test kits ran out, and prevention programmes for high‑risk groups like sex workers and LGBTQ+ people disappeared. Because fewer people are tested and protected, doctors warn that up to 3.3 million more people could become infected by 2030. Some governments are starting to invest more at home and new long‑acting medicines are emerging, but action is still urgent."
