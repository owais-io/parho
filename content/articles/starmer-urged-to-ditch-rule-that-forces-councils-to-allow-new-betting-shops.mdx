title: "Starmer urged to ditch rule that forces councils to allow new betting shops"
summary: "A group of almost 300 politicians and activists wrote to the PM and Starmer asking him to remove a rule that forces councils to give licences to new betting shops and 24‑hour slot‑machine venues. The rule, created in 2005, means councils must err on the side of allowing gambling premises, even when locals oppose them. Supporters say the rule hurts high streets, hurts vulnerable people. They want councils to have more power and say the rule is outdated."
