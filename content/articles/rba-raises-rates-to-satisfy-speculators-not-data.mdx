title: "RBA Raises Rates to Satisfy Speculators, Not Data"
summary: "Greg Jericho says the Reserve Bank of Australia lifted the cash rate to 3.85% mainly because markets expected a hike, not because of solid inflation or wage growth. A sharp drop in unemployment in December pushed speculators to bet on a rise, and the RBA’s own statement echoed that market sentiment. The decision came despite weak wage growth and no clear rise in inflation."
