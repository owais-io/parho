title: "AI Fear Could Spark a New Workers’ Movement"
summary: "AI fears are making workers think twice about staying in their jobs. People worry that robots and software might replace them or turn their work into low‑wage, monitored tasks. Because of this, workers across the country are starting to organize again, similar to the big union wave after COVID. While AI could squeeze workers out, it could also give them power if we shape how it’s used."
