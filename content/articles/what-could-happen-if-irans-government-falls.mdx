title: "What Could Happen if Iran’s Government Falls"
summary: "Iran is facing huge protests over high inflation and political repression.  The U.S. and Iran’s foreign ministry are in talks, but many experts say a war is likely if talks fail.  The current unrest echoes the 1979 revolution that toppled the Shah and set the stage for a new Islamist regime.  Like in 1979, a wide mix of workers, students, clerics, and minorities are demanding change, but the future direction after any collapse is still unclear."
