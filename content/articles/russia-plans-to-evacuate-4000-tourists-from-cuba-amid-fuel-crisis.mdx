title: "Russia Plans to Evacuate 4,000 Tourists from Cuba Amid Fuel Crisis"
summary: "Russia is arranging to pull about 4,000 Russian tourists out of Cuba in the next few days because the island can no longer keep enough jet fuel after a U.S. oil blockade. Two Russian airlines will fly people home on one‑way flights before stopping all service to the Caribbean. Cuban airports are running out of fuel, hurting tourism and everyday transport, and many tourists are state workers. The move shows Moscow’s support for its ally amid U.S. pressure."
