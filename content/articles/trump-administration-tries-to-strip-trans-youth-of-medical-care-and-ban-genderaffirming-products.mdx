title: "Trump Administration Tries to Strip Trans Youth of Medical Care and Ban Gender‑Affirming Products"
summary: "The Trump administration is pushing rules that would cut off medical care for transgender teens, call puberty blockers and hormones “sex‑rejecting,” and punish doctors who treat them. It has sent warning letters to companies that sell binders and prosthetic clothing, calling them unregistered medical devices. The move is part of a broader effort to limit trans people’s rights, with a new bill making trans care a felony. These actions could drive trans people into unsafe underground markets."
