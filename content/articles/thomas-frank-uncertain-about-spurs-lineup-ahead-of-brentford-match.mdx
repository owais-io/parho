title: "Thomas Frank Uncertain About Spurs Lineup Ahead of Brentford Match"
summary: "Thomas Frank says he still hasn't found the perfect Spurs lineup, especially on the left side where he switches between Johnson, Tel, and Odobert. After a 2‑0 home loss to Fulham, he’s kept his squad calm and ready for a game against his old club Brentford. He believes rotating players, even with Champions League duties, will help the team settle. Frank also sees Xavi Simons growing into a key playmaker, while keeping a steady, patient attitude."
