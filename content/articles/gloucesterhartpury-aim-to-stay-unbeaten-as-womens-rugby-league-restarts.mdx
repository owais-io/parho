title: "Gloucester‑Hartpury Aim to Stay Unbeaten as Women’s Rugby League Restarts"
summary: "Gloucester‑Hartpury are still unbeaten and will play Loughborough this weekend as the Premiership Women’s Rugby league comes back after a six‑week break. A win would put them ahead of Saracens, who sit on top of the table and have a bye. The top spot matters because it guarantees a home semi‑final. Players like Emma Wassell are returning, and the league will not add new teams this season."
