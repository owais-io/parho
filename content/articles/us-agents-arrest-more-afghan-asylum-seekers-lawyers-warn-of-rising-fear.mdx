title: "US Agents Arrest More Afghan Asylum Seekers, Lawyers Warn of Rising Fear"
summary: "U.S. immigration agents are arresting Afghan asylum seekers more often, especially those already waiting for court hearings. Lawyers say the arrests shock families and create fear that staying in the U.S. is unsafe. Some were caught while checking in or wearing ankle monitors. The Trump and Biden administrations have paused asylum processing for millions, but those in court still deserve hearings. Attorneys struggle to explain why their clients were detained and worry about future policy changes."
