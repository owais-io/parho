title: "Labour’s tough climb in Gorton and Denton by‑election"
summary: "A by‑election in Gorton and Denton shows how split British politics are. Labour’s attempts to attract new voters have backfired, driving away core supporters. The far‑right Reform party is pushing hard immigration limits and a “take‑back” agenda, and even some Tories back it. Polls reveal voters are split on taxes, climate and leadership style. Labour needs to win back support before Reform can take seats."
