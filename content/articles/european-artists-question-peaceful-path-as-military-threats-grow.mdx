title: "European Artists Question Peaceful Path as Military Threats Grow"
summary: "At the European film awards, a Croatian documentary won for its look at a 1919 war. The director used his speech to urge students to oppose Germany’s militarisation. While Europeans cherish a peace‑heavy identity, the Ukraine war and other threats make rearmament a serious topic. Some think Europe can be “armed pacifists” – protected but still peace‑oriented. Artists now debate whether their work can support that balance."
