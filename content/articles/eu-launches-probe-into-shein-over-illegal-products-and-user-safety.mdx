title: "EU launches probe into Shein over illegal products and user safety"
summary: "Europe’s top regulator has opened a formal inquiry into fast‑fashion retailer Shein after finding evidence of illegal items on the site, such as child‑like sex dolls and weapons. The probe will also look at the platform’s addictive features, its opaque recommendation engine, and whether it meets the Digital Services Act’s transparency rules. Shein says it is cooperating and has tightened controls, but the EU says it remains high risk and could ban sales if it fails to comply."
