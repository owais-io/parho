summary: "On Saturday, 803 people crossed the English Channel in 13 dinghies from France, the biggest December day‑crossing ever. December is usually slow because of cold, storms, and less daylight. The total of this year’s crossings is 41,455, below the 2022 record of 45,755. A Border Force boat brought the newcomers into Dover, while French authorities rescued 151 and returned them to France. The UK is working with France and Germany to curb the crisis."
