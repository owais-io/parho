title: "Palestinians need security, aid, and a political future"
summary: "Ceasefire has slowed killings, but Israeli attacks keep driving families out of Gaza. Aid is higher but Israel still blocks supplies. Palestinians need safety, help, rebuilding and a political future. Marwan Barghouti, a 66‑year‑old jailed for murder, is a popular figure who could unite Palestinians. International leaders want him freed, but Israel fears that would mean accepting a Palestinian state. Prisoner conditions are getting worse, and a death‑penalty bill is looming. The US may push for his release."
