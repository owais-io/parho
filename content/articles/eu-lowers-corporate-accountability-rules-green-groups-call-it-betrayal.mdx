title: "EU Lowers Corporate Accountability Rules, Green Groups Call It Betrayal"
summary: "On Tuesday the EU Parliament voted to cut the rules that force companies to report on social and environmental harm. Only firms with more than 5,000 staff and €1.5 bn a year must now do due‑diligence, and the rule will not start until 2029. Green groups say this is a betrayal that lets harmful businesses escape accountability, blaming pressure from the US, Qatar and far‑right politicians."
