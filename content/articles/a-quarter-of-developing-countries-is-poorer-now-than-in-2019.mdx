title: "A Quarter of Developing Countries Is Poorer Now Than in 2019"
summary: "The World Bank says 1 in 4 developing countries is poorer now than in 2019. Many are in sub‑Saharan Africa and have been hurt by war, famine and the pandemic. Growth has slowed and isn’t enough to lift people out of poverty or create enough jobs. The bank warns that bad policies and high debt hold back progress, and governments need sound budgets, trade, investment and education."
