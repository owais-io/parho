title: "Richard Tice Tries to Apologise but Keeps Making Mistakes"
summary: "Richard Tice tried to apologise in a Reform press conference, but his speech was full of contradictions. He said he wanted to help disabled children and was unhappy with special education policies, yet he used offensive language and made odd promises. He also defended far‑right comments, avoided saying sorry for past remarks, and left the audience confused. The piece shows how his attempt to win support back falls apart."
