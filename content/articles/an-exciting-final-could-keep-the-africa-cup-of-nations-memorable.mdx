title: "An Exciting Final Could Keep the Africa Cup of Nations Memorable"
summary: "While the Africa Cup of Nations has had good football, it’s been predictable, with top teams winning all the way to the final. Morocco, the hosts, face Senegal, a regular finalist. The tournament’s format and many “box‑ticking” group games have made it feel dull, and many players come from Europe, showing a strong diaspora link. A thrilling final could make the competition memorable, but if it’s another easy win, it may fade into history."
