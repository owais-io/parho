title: "EU Investigates Google for Using Web and YouTube Content in AI"
summary: "The EU is investigating Google to see if it is breaking competition rules by using web and YouTube content for its AI, like Gemini. The Commission worries Google gives itself special access and unfair terms, paying publishers nothing and not letting creators refuse. This could hurt other AI companies and keeping other AI makers at a disadvantage. Google’s boss, Sundar Pichai, said AI can make mistakes and nobody is immune if the AI hype ends."
