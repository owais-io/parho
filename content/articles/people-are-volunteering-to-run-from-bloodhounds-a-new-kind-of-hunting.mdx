title: "People Are Volunteering to Run From Bloodhounds – A New Kind of Hunting"
summary: "In England and Wales, a new “clean‑boot” hunting trend is popping up. Volunteers run through fields while packs of bloodhounds chase them after the 2004 fox‑hunting ban was tightened. The hunts, backed by both animal‑rights groups and former hunters, let runners give off strong scents and then be pursued. Though the hounds are gentle, the experience feels thrilling and raises questions about how hunting is being redefined."
