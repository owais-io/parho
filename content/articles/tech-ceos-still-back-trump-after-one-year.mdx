title: "Tech CEOs Still Back Trump After One Year"
summary: "One year after taking office, President Trump still enjoys strong support from top tech CEOs, who reap benefits from new contracts and policy changes. Trump is concerned about soaring electricity costs from growing data centers and wants to cut power bills, yet his administration has rolled back renewable projects. Meanwhile, Germany, the UK and Ireland struggle with high energy prices from data centers. Australia’s ban on under‑16 social‑media accounts has seen many deletions, but critics say it’s ineffective."
