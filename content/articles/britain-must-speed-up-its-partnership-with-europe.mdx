title: "Britain Must Speed Up Its Partnership with Europe"
summary: "Sir Keir Starmer wants to focus on UK domestic issues, but Donald Trump’s return throws international affairs into chaos. Trump’s moves—from trying to take Greenland to blocking Venezuelan oil—have forced UK leaders to juggle foreign crises while trying to improve trade with Europe. The public now sees the costs of Brexit, and the government is pushing for closer ties with the EU without letting free‑movement of workers back in. The result: Britain must make clear, bold choices to keep its place in Europe and protect its own interests."
