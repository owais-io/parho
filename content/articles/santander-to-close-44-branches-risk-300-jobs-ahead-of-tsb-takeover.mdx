title: "Santander to close 44 branches, risk 300 jobs ahead of TSB takeover"
summary: "Santander will shut 44 UK branches, risking around 300 jobs, as it pushes ahead with a £2.6bn takeover of rival TSB. The cuts come because more customers are using mobile and online banking, so fewer physical branches are needed. The bank will still have 305 locations, but only 244 offer full services. Staff may find new roles, and unions are watching closely."
