title: "Trump says US oil firms will jump into Venezuela after Maduro capture"
summary: "Trump said Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro was taken by US forces that oil firms will jump into Venezuela and rebuild the oil system, saying the country’s oil was stolen. He thinks the move will spark an oil boom in 18 months. Analysts doubt it, pointing out past problems: Chavez nationalised the industry, US sanctions stopped work for years, and only Chevron is now in the country. Other nations like Iraq and Libya show how politics can keep oil output low."
