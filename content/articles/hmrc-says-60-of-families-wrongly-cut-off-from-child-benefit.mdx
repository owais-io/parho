title: "HMRC Says 60% of Families Wrongly Cut Off From Child Benefit"
summary: "HMRC stopped child benefit for about 23,000 parents because it thought they had left the UK, using faulty travel records. New figures show that 60‑70% of those families were actually still living in the country and deserved the benefit. The government has admitted the error and halted further checks that rely on Home Office data. Families who lost money are fighting for refunds, while watchdogs warn about data‑handling mistakes."
