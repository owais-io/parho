title: "Women Giving Birth in Prison: A Terrible Reality"
summary: "In El Salvador, a 35‑week‑pregnant activist was jailed and her baby died behind bars. Her story shows a common pattern: women in prison often get no medical help, are locked in bad cells, and some are even handcuffed during labour. The UN says pregnant prisoners should receive special care or be released, but the rules are not followed. Some places are starting to change things, but many women still suffer."
