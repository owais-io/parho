title: "Trump’s drug‑price site offers only a few discounts, experts say"
summary: "The Trump administration has launched TrumpRx, a website that offers discounts on 43 prescription drugs. Experts point out that many of those drugs are already cheap or available in cheaper generic form, and the site’s selection is too narrow to help most people. The platform may help a few patients, especially with weight‑loss or fertility drugs, but it does not solve the broader problem of high U.S. drug prices."
