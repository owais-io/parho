title: "All headphones tested contain harmful chemicals"
summary: "Researchers from the ToxFREE project tested 81 headphones from brands like Bose, Panasonic, Samsung and Sennheiser. Every pair had harmful chemicals – mostly BPA, its substitute BPS, and other endocrine‑disrupting compounds such as phthalates. These substances can migrate into skin and sweat, raising long‑term health risks like cancer and hormonal problems. Even though no immediate danger was found, experts worry about long‑term exposure. The study calls for banning such chemicals in consumer goods and better transparency from manufacturers."
