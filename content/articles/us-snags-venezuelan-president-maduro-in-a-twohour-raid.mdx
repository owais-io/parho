title: "US snags Venezuelan president Maduro in a two‑hour raid"
summary: "Over several months, U.S. intelligence tracked President Nicolás Maduro’s movements. In the early morning of Saturday, a team of Delta Force soldiers, backed by air strikes that knocked out Venezuela’s air defenses, flew in helicopters to the capital’s military base. Maduro and his wife were taken without U.S. casualties. The operation lasted just over two hours, but experts say removing a head of state won’t automatically change Venezuela’s politics."
