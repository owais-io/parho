title: "Defense Secretary Plans to Cut Military Support for Scouting America Over Gender Issues"
summary: "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wants to cut the Pentagon’s support for Scouting America because the group now lets girls in and has changed its name. He says the Scouts’ gender‑inclusive policies could threaten national security. If his proposal succeeds, the military would stop sending medical teams, trucks, and other help to the Scouts’ big jamboree and would bar troops from using military bases. Scouting America says it values its partnership with the armed forces."
