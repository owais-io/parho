title: "A Few Pieces of Plastic Can Kill a Puffin"
summary: "A study shows swallowing a few plastic pieces can kill seabirds, turtles and marine mammals. Researchers examined over 10,000 carcasses to find how much plastic made them likely to die. A puffin could die from as little as three sugar‑cube‑sized bits; a loggerhead turtle from about a baseball; marine mammals from a football‑sized amount. Roughly half of dead turtles and a third of birds had plastic in their guts. The researchers call for stricter plastic rules and better waste management."
