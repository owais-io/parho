title: "Readers share what they'd write in their last letter"
summary: "Danish post will stop sending ordinary letters, so people were asked what they would send in their final mail. Respondents wrote personal messages: some would tell a loved one how much they’re loved, others would close a lifelong archive of love letters, thank a mother or a teacher, or reflect on old friendships. The stories show how letters remain a powerful way to show care, even as digital communication grows."
