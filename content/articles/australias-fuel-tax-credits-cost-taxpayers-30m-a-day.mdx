title: "Australia’s fuel tax credits cost taxpayers $30m a day"
summary: "Australia’s government is giving huge money back to big fuel users, like mining companies, through a fuel tax credit scheme. The bill is the biggest cost in the budget, costing taxpayers almost $10.8 billion this year—about $30 million every day. Critics say it’s a fossil‑fuel subsidy that hinders the country’s climate goals. Some want to cap or end the credits, but the government has said it will keep them."
