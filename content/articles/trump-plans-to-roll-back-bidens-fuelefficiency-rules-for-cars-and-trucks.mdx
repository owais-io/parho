title: "Trump plans to roll back Biden’s fuel‑efficiency rules for cars and trucks"
summary: "Trump said he will undo the Biden‑era fuel‑efficiency rules for new cars and trucks, allowing them to run on less‑efficient engines. The new rules would lower the required average miles per gallon from about 50 to about 34 by 2031. He says it will make cars cheaper and support U.S. jobs, but environmental groups warn it will raise gas use, hurt families, and slow America’s clean‑vehicle progress."
