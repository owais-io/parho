title: "Europe Will Lead a Joint Force in Ukraine as Part of a US‑Backed Peace Plan"
summary: "European leaders say they will form a multinational force to support Ukraine, with U.S. backing, as part of a new peace proposal. The plan would let European troops help train Ukrainian soldiers, guard the skies and sea, and could give Ukraine security guarantees similar to NATO. Talks still differ over which parts of Ukraine Russia holds and whether Ukraine would give up any land. The U.S. hopes the deal will stop the war and help Ukraine join the EU."
