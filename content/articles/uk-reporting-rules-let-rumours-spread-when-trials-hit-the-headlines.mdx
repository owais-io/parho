title: "UK reporting rules let rumours spread when trials hit the headlines"
summary: "UK reporting rules are so old that they let rumours spread when courts are on trial. In the Lucy Letby case a 13,000‑word New Yorker article was blocked, showing how contempt of court and privacy laws stop journalists from giving full detail. These rules were written for newspapers, not for millions of people on social media. The law still limits what can be said about suspects, motives, and past convictions, so the public often sees only speculation online."
