title: "US Named an “Endangered Lawyer” Country – Justice System Under Attack"
summary: "International legal groups have named the United States as a country where lawyers and judges face political intimidation, calling it an “endangered lawyer” state. The decision focuses on Trump‑era actions: firing DOJ lawyers, slamming judges, threatening law firms with contract loss, and sending UN letters about violent threats. The coalition warns this attacks the rule of law, creates a chilling effect on legal advocacy, and risks long‑term damage to US justice."
