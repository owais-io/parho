title: "What If We Could Hear the Sun? It Would Be Too Loud"
summary: "The sun is a giant fusion reactor that turns hydrogen into helium and produces a lot of heat and, in theory, sound. Sound needs air to travel, so we can't hear it from space. If the space between us and the sun were filled with air, the noise would be over 100 decibels—like a chainsaw or a rock concert. Even louder would be the low‑frequency vibrations, which could shake buildings like a massive earthquake."
