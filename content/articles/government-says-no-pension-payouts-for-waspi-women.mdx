title: "Government says no pension payouts for ‘Waspi women’"
summary: "Millions of women born in the 1950s, known as ‘Waspi women’, were promised money if the state pension age was raised from 60 to 66. The government kept changing its mind, but now it says no one will get a payout. Campaigners say this is unfair and plan new court cases. The decision could cost billions, so the ministry says it’s not practical to pay the whole group."
