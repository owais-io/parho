summary: "The upcoming release of documents about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as the UK’s ambassador to the US will be reviewed by the intelligence committee. Labour MPs want to know what the Prime Minister’s team knew about Mandelson’s links to Jeffrey Epstein and why they gave him the post. They also hope to see if Starmer or chief of staff Morgan McSweeney pushed the decision. The papers could expose how the move was justified and whether internal politics played a role."
