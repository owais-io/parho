title: "Can AI Help Fight Climate Change?"
summary: "Some climate leaders say AI could cut greenhouse gases by making things like public transport, farming and energy grids run smarter. A new AI Climate Institute will teach poorer countries to use AI for that. But the huge data centers that power AI use a lot of electricity, and a study warns AI could add 44 million tonnes of CO₂ by 2030. Most experts say most AI work still fuels profit‑driven companies, not the planet, so the debate continues."
