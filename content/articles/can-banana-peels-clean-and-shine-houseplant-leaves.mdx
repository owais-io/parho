title: "Can Banana Peels Clean and Shine Houseplant Leaves?"
summary: "Dust blocks light and dulls plant leaves. Some say rubbing the inside of a banana peel on leaves cleans and shines them because of potassium and natural oils. I tried it on a rubber plant: it looked bright at first, but the peel left a sticky film that attracted more dust later. Textured leaves even caught banana fibers. In the end, a damp cloth or microfiber duster works best for long‑term care."
