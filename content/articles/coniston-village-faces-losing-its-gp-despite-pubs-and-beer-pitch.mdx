summary: "The village of Coniston, 800 people, has lost its long‑standing GP after a search for a new doctor failed. An advertising campaign highlighted local pubs and scenery but no doctors applied. MPs say the NHS is slow to act and that losing the surgery would force residents, many over 65, to drive hours to get care. The shortage reflects a national GP crisis."
