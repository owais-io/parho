title: "Labour MPs Push for More Credit Unions to Help Low‑Income People"
summary: "A group of Labour MPs has written to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, urging a major expansion of credit unions so that low‑income people can borrow and save at cheaper rates. They want the government to add a duty for housing associations to promote credit‑union membership, let credit unions tap the Help‑to‑Save scheme, and ease rules that limit their growth. MPs say the move would fight the cost‑of‑living crisis, cut reliance on payday lenders, and boost community finance."
