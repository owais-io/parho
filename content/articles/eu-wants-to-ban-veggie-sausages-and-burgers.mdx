title: "EU wants to ban veggie sausages and burgers"
summary: "The EU is tightening food‑label rules, forcing plant‑based products like veggie sausages and burgers to be re‑branded. A recent survey of Dutch people shows most understand the terms, yet Parliament says only meat products can use those names. The move is less about consumer confusion and more about protecting the livestock industry. It could spread to the UK and hurt the market for vegan foods, while similar bans already exist for oat milk and soy butter."
