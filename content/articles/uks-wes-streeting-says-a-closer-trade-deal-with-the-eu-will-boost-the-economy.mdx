title: "UK’s Wes Streeting says a closer trade deal with the EU will boost the economy"
summary: "Wes Streeting, Labour’s health secretary, said Britain’s economy would grow if it entered a deeper trading partnership with the EU. He warned that the country has paid too much tax and taken on too much debt after leaving the EU, and that a new deal could’t bring back freedom of movement. While the government has ruled out a customs union, Streeting’s comments suggest it might still be on the table."
