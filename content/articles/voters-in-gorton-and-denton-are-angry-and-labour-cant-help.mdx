title: "Voters in Gorton and Denton Are Angry and Labour Can’t Help"
summary: "In the Manchester suburb of Gorton and the town of Denton, voters are angry and feel ignored by the government. People complain about high rents, the cost of living, crime, and immigration. They don’t trust Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, and many wonder whether they should vote for Reform UK or the Green Party instead. The by‑election could decide Labour’s future and shows a deep sense of disconnection in the community."
