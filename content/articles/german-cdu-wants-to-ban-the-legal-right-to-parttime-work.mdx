title: "German CDU wants to ban the legal right to part‑time work"
summary: "The business wing of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union is pushing a rule that would stop people from choosing part‑time jobs unless they’re caring for kids, helping relatives, or training. The plan aims to tackle a shortage of skilled workers, but many in the party and unions say it hurts parents, women and those needing flexibility. Germany already has the highest part‑time rate in Europe, with most workers who do so being women."
