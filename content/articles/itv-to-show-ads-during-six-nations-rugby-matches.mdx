title: "ITV to Show Ads During Six Nations Rugby Matches"
summary: "ITV will air split‑screen commercials during every Six Nations rugby game, starting with the France‑Ireland opener at the Stade de France. The ads sit on the right side for about 20 seconds while the live action stays on the left, so viewers still see commentary. The move is part of a new rights deal and could help ITV recoup costs and bring similar ads to future events like the World Cup."
