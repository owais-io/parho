title: "Thailand’s Tang Khen Bay Now Has Just One Dugong"
summary: "Thailand’s Tang Khen Bay now hosts just one dugong, a marine mammal similar to a sea cow, after others disappeared. A local volunteer, Theerasak “Pop” Saksritawee, uses a drone to watch the animal, called Miracle, every day. Scientists say the loss is tied to dying seagrass beds caused by pollution, warming seas, and storms. The remaining dugongs are in danger, and people are trying to protect the habitat and keep boats away."
