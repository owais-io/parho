title: "Who’s running the new Reform Australia party?"
summary: "At a Sydney anti‑immigration rally, a man handed out flyers for a new group called Reform Australia. The flyers say the major parties have failed and invite people to join. The group isn’t yet a registered party, but its website is owned by Walter Villatora, a former Liberal branch president linked to the right‑wing Turning Point Australia. A separate site, Reform Au, points to Luke Ashwood. No clear leader has emerged, and experts doubt the party will succeed."
