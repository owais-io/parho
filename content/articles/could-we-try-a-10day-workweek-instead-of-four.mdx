title: "Could We Try a 10‑Day Workweek Instead of Four?"
summary: "A writer argues that, instead of cutting the workweek to four days, we could try a 10‑day week—work for seven days and then have three days off. The idea is that the extra day of work would add more production for the economy, while workers would get a long weekend every week. The author even suggests a fun competition to give the three extra weekdays fun names."
