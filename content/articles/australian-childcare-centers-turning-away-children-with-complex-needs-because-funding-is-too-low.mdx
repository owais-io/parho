title: "Australian childcare centers turning away children with complex needs because funding is too low"
summary: "Australian childcare centers are refusing to take children with complex needs because the government’s inclusion funding is too low and centres run out of staff. The Inclusion Support Program gives only half the money needed, so many centres must pay the rest. Parents must wait months for diagnosis and funding, and staff feel burnt out, risking quitting. Calls for a bigger budget and faster approvals."
