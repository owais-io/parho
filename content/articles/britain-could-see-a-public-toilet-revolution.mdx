title: "Britain Could See a Public Toilet Revolution"
summary: "In the UK, many public toilets have shut, leaving people without a safe place to go. New architects are turning the idea of a toilet into a public space that looks good and feels safe. Projects in London, like those in Woolwich and Maida Hill, use good design, extra services such as cafés, and are paid for by local councils and national grants. The government’s new Pride in Place plan could help keep more toilets open, improving cities for everyone."
