title: "Brazil’s Uncontacted Kawahiva Tribe Still Unprotected"
summary: "Brazil’s Funai team found a small uncontacted tribe, the Kawahiva, deep in the Amazon. A Supreme Court ruling ordered the government to demarcate a 400,000‑hectare reserve to stop loggers and ranchers from cutting the forest and threatening the tribe. But paperwork, money and violence have stalled the process. Loggers still enter the area, and armed threats against officials keep the demarcation from happening until at least 2026."
