title: "High streets are fading across Britain"
summary: "High streets across Britain are disappearing, with about 13,000 shops shutting in 2024 – almost one a day. The loss hits the north, Midlands and coastal towns the hardest, leaving empty streets that hurt local pride and community spirit. Voters see fixing the high streets as a top priority after healthcare and crime, so Labour is pushing £5 bn of new money and local control plans. But true revival will need bigger budgets, fair taxes on bricks‑and‑mortar and new social hubs."
