summary: "Scam centres are secret factories that run online fraud, human trafficking and money‑laundering, mainly in Southeast Asia. After Myanmar’s junta took power, the number of these places doubled along the Thai‑Myanmar border. Hundreds of thousands of people, many from Africa and Asia, are tricked into jobs, then locked and forced to scam people worldwide. Workers are beaten and shocked. Thailand shut off power and internet to hit them, and Myanmar’s army raided a centre, freeing 2,100 people."
