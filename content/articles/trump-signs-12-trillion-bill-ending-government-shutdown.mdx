title: "Trump signs $1.2 trillion bill, ending government shutdown"
summary: "On Tuesday, President Trump signed a $1.2 trillion spending bill that ended a shutdown. The House had just approved it with a narrow 217‑214 vote. Democrats stalled the bill because they want new rules for the Department of Homeland Security after two U.S. citizens were killed by ICE agents. They want body‑camera footage, no masks, a code of conduct and arrest warrants. Trump signed the bill, but the future of those demands remains unclear."
