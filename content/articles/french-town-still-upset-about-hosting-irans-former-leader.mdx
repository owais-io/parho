title: "French town still upset about hosting Iran’s former leader"
summary: "Every year, Iranian supporters gather in Neauphle-le-Château, a small French town, to remember Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who lived there for four months in the 1970s. The town was chosen by France to give him shelter before he returned to Tehran and started Iran’s current regime. Local residents feel the name has stuck and hurt them, so the mayor wants no more signs of his stay. The town now tries to forget the connection."
