title: "UK Delays China Embassy Decision Until January"
summary: "The UK government has pushed back the decision on approving China’s biggest embassy in London until January, when Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to visit Beijing. Security officials say the new building can be secured, but local residents oppose it because of China’s human‑rights record. Ministers have delayed the vote before and want to wait for Starmer’s trip. The embassy would replace seven separate Chinese sites at the Royal Mint Court near Tower Bridge."
