title: "Simple blood test predicts best breast‑cancer treatment"
summary: "Scientists have made a simple blood test that checks DNA from breast‑cancer cells. By measuring tiny bits of tumour DNA in the blood, doctors can tell early if a treatment will work. The test was tried on 167 patients and showed that low DNA levels at the start or after four weeks mean better chances of the cancer shrinking. It could let doctors switch to better medicines faster and help patients live longer."
