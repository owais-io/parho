title: "Venezuela raid may encourage China and Russia, warns UK MP"
summary: "Emily Thornberry, chair of the UK Commons foreign‑affairs committee, said the U.S. has flown Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro to the U.S. without a clear legal basis. Because Britain hasn’t condemned the move, she fears other powers like China and Russia might think they can take similar actions against countries such as Ukraine or Taiwan. UK officials say they’ll explain the law later, but Thornberry wants Britain to call the U.S. act a breach of international law."
