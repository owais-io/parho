title: "London councils spend over £500m a year on private firms, showing heavy reliance"
summary: "Local councils in London paid over £555m to private consultancies and outsourcing firms in 2024. The money comes after cuts to council budgets, leaving councils to hire outside firms for software, temporary staff and advice. Spending on consultants has jumped 76% since 2013, and councils like Barnet and Lambeth have relied on big names such as Capita and Serco. Critics say this makes councils weak and suggests a need to rebuild in‑house skills."
