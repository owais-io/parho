title: "Trump Gives Record‑Length State of the Union Speech, Fails to Address Key Issues"
summary: "Trump gave the longest State of the Union ever, running for about 1 hour 47 minutes. He mixed long speeches, jokes, and attacks on Democrats, while trying to look like a unifier. But many viewers said he avoided the most pressing topics—like immigration deaths, the economy, and the possible war in Iran. His style was seen as tired and confusing, and critics say he missed the chance to reset before the mid‑terms."
