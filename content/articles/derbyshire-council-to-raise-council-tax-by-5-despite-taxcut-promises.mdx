title: "Derbyshire Council to Raise Council Tax by 5% Despite Tax‑Cut Promises"
summary: "Derbyshire County Council plans to raise council tax by the maximum 5% allowed, even though its Reform‑UK majority campaigned on cutting taxes. The rise comes after the council found a £38 million shortfall due to higher spending on children’s and adult social care. Critics say the party’s election promises were “empty rhetoric.” The tax hike would bring in about £29 million, while the council also plans to cut services by £22 million, but it hasn’t announced job cuts."
