title: "Amateur Historians Power Genealogy Research"
summary: "Amateur historians, like Louise Cocker who has photographed over half a million graves in Norfolk, create huge datasets that genealogy sites use. Their passion for niche records—such as apprentices, wills, or WWII civilian deaths—fills gaps left by official archives. Companies like Findmypast license these collections, showing how hobbyists give ordinary people a voice and help families find missing ancestors. This collaborative effort keeps family histories alive for future generations."
