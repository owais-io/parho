title: "Victoria Faces Record-Setting Heatwave"
summary: "I grew up in a small town in north‑west Victoria where summers are already tough. This month the area hit record‑breaking temperatures, with Ouyen and nearby towns soaring past 44 °C. I remember earlier heatwaves, like the 2009 Black Saturday fires, and how the heat feels even hotter now. The extreme heat isn’t just uncomfortable—it’s a growing climate threat that’s making everyday life harder for locals."
