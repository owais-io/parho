title: "Syria’s war: Kurds lose control, US abandons them"
summary: "In recent weeks the Syrian government pushed back the Kurdish‑led forces that once ruled much of the north‑east. The U.S., which had helped fight ISIS with the Kurds, now says the partnership is over, leaving thousands of former ISIS fighters in camps with no plan for safety or rehabilitation. European leaders worry the camps could spark new violence, and that the Kurds’ political future is at risk. A peaceful, inclusive solution is urgently needed."
