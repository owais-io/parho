title: "**2025 UK Budget: What You Need to Know**"
summary: "On March 20, the chancellor, Sarah Reeves, faced an early release blunder from the OBR. The budget keeps worker taxes flat but raises taxes on the wealthy, adding a “mansion” tax and higher pension income tax. ISA limits drop to £50, energy bills are cut, and the two‑child limit on Universal Credit is removed, helping lift children out of poverty. Minimum wages rise, sugary drinks face a higher tax, and fuel duty stays frozen for now."
