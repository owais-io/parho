title: "UK’s former industrial towns still face deep economic problems"
summary: "A new report says Britain’s old coal, steel and textile towns still lag behind. About one in seven young people (16‑24) are not in school, work or training, and families from working‑class backgrounds are less likely to land high‑pay jobs, especially women. While some places like Aberdeen and Brighton are catching up, the North and Midlands still feel the long‑term effects of deindustrialisation. Young people today care more about balance and job security than just a big salary."
