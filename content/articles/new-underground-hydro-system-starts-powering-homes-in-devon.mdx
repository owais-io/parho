title: "New Underground Hydro System Starts Powering Homes in Devon"
summary: "Engineers in Devon have turned a hillside into a “battery” that pumps a thick, mineral‑rich fluid up a gentle slope when there’s plenty of power and lets it flow back down to spin turbines when electricity is needed. The underground system can keep 500 kW running, enough for about 400 homes for a year. It’s cheaper and faster to build than traditional dams and could be used in many places to store wind and solar power for later use."
