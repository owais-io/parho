title: "Taiwanese Man Helps Families Return Graves Back to China"
summary: "Liu De‑wen, a 58‑year‑old from Kaohsiung, carries the ashes of former Nationalist soldiers and civilians who were taken to Taiwan in 1949 and could never go home. Over 23 years he has hauled more than 2,000 urns back to the Fujian coast, doing the paperwork and the trip himself, and he does it for free. His work reminds people of the long‑ago war that split families, and it has become a story Beijing uses to promote reunification."
