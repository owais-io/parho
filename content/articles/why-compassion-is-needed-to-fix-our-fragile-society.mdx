title: "Why Compassion Is Needed to Fix Our Fragile Society"
summary: "The article says that our world is broken into pieces by many crises, but fragility isn’t a failure—it’s a condition that needs care. Modern systems prize speed, certainty, and outrage, leaving little room for compassion. As a result, people are treated as problems and caring feels squeezed out. The writer argues we need to slow down, allow doubt, empathy, and reflection to rebuild trust, democracy, and culture—remelting broken glass instead of burning it."
