title: "COP30 Climate Summit: Talks Drag On, No Clear Deal Yet"
summary: "In Brazil’s COP30, negotiators are still working late into the night, hoping to finish a climate deal. Talks have stalled because some countries, especially Saudi Arabia and other oil producers, want to keep fossil fuels in the conversation. The U.S. isn’t present, so its usual pressure to push for a fossil‑fuel roadmap is missing. Brazil’s president hopes for a breakthrough, but the outcome is still uncertain as delegates try to wrap up before flights depart."
