title: "Cocaine price drop pushes traffickers to reuse smuggler submarines"
summary: "Cocaine prices have dropped sharply, so drug smugglers are now refitting the half‑submarine boats they used to sink after a single trip. Spanish police have spotted about ten of these “narco‑subs” and seized more than 120 tonnes of cocaine last year. Instead of being thrown away, traffickers unload the drugs, refuel at sea, and sail back to South America for another run. Meanwhile, Spanish police are also shutting down dozens of growing meth, amphetamine and MDMA labs."
