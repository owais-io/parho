title: "Trump Removes EPA Rule That Lets It Regulate Climate Pollution"
summary: "Donald Trump has removed the EPA’s “endangerment finding,” which says greenhouse gases threaten public health and gives the agency a legal basis to limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Critics say the move is a huge win for fossil‑fuel companies and a blow to Americans’ health and climate action. Environmental groups, led by California, plan to sue the EPA to restore the rule, making this a major deregulatory step in U.S. climate policy."
