summary: "Trump ordered air strikes on the north of Nigeria on Christmas, targeting Islamic State fighters. He said the attacks were because militants are killing Christians. The U.S. worked with the Nigerian government and had permission. Nigeria said the strikes were part of joint security work and not about Christian persecution. The violence in Nigeria is linked to land disputes and criminal gangs, not only religion. The moves come as Trump promises to end US wars."
