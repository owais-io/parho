title: "Australia’s cricket ban hurts Afghans. A better path."
summary: "After the Taliban took Kabul, Afghan refugees were sent to Australia. While in quarantine, they watched Afghan cricketers like Rashid Khan play, keeping a link to their home. Australia stopped playing Afghan teams because the Taliban ban women from sport, but that hurts the players who have no control over the regime. The writer suggests Australia should keep cricket ties and use them to help Afghan women in exile, rather than isolating all Afghan cricket."
