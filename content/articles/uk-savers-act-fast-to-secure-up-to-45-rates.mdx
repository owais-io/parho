title: "UK Savers: Act Fast to Secure Up to 4.5% Rates"
summary: "UK savers can still find one‑year fixed‑rate bonds paying up to 4.35% and easy‑access accounts at 4.5%. After the Bank of England cut rates, many accounts slipped, but top deals have stayed higher than expected. Inflation is still up, so the Bank might hold rates, keeping good offers alive. But higher inflation eats real returns. The best offers drop fast, so act quickly to lock in the highest rate."
