summary: "Coventry City’s recent roller‑coaster has kept fans on edge. After falling to League Two nine years ago, they climbed back up, only to face tough ownership and a controversial move to Birmingham’s ground. In 2020 they returned to the Championship, but a playoff loss to Sunderland and the sacking of Mark Robins left them struggling. With Frank Lampard on the bench, the team’s form has been uneven, and a recent draw against Oxford shows they’re still fighting for promotion."
