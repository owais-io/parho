title: "Saudi Arabia Delays 2034 World Cup Stadium Builds to Cut Costs"
summary: "Saudi Arabia’s plan to build 15 stadiums for the 2034 World Cup is running behind schedule as the Public Investment Fund (PIF) pushes to lower costs. Architecture firms have been asked to cut their designs, and some contractors say work will start later than planned. The country may even cut the number of venues. Falling oil prices are tightening the PIF’s budget, but the World Cup is still nine years away."
