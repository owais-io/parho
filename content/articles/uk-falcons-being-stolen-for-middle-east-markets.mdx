title: "UK Falcons Being Stolen for Middle East Markets"
summary: "UK investigators have found that many peregrine falcon nests have been raided in the last decade to supply the Middle East with prized birds for racing and breeding. Police Scotland and wildlife officers have uncovered wild‑caught falcons inside UK breeding centres, showing that the illegal trade is real. The UAE especially wants British falcons for their speed and pedigree. This crime, part of a global wildlife trafficking wave, is happening right here in Britain."
