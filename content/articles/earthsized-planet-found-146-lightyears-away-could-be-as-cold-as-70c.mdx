title: "Earth‑Sized Planet Found 146 Light‑Years Away, Could Be as Cold as –70°C"
summary: "Scientists have spotted a new planet that’s about the same size as Earth, just 146 light‑years from us. It orbits a sun‑like star and might spend half of its time in a zone where liquid water could exist. However, the star is cooler, so the planet could be as cold as –70 °C—maybe a giant “snowball.” Only one transit has been seen, so more data are needed before calling it a confirmed exoplanet."
