title: "Michigan Rules Let Utility Donations Go Unreported"
summary: "In Michigan, a loophole in campaign‑finance rules lets utilities like DTE and Consumers Energy cut checks to lawmakers without the donation date matching the date the campaign reports receiving it. A study of 2025 data shows 89 % of donations had mismatched dates and 37 % were still unreported by mid‑December. The problem surfaces around big bills—carbon‑capture and data‑center approvals—and fuels calls for a ban on utility political gifts."
