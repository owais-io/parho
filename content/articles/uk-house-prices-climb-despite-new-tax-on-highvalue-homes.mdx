title: "UK house prices climb despite new tax on high‑value homes"
summary: "UK house prices rose 0.3% in November, Nationwide said, even though a new tax on homes over £2m was announced. The average price was £272,998, up from £272,226 in October. The tax will affect less than 1% of homes, so experts say it won’t hurt the market much. Bank of England kept rates at 4%, but inflation is easing, so lenders stay ready to lend."
