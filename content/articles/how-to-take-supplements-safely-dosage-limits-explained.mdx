title: "How to Take Supplements Safely: Dosage Limits Explained"
summary: "With over 100,000 supplements on the market, most people think they’re safe, but too much can hurt. Experts say you should stick to recommended daily amounts (RDAs) and never exceed the upper limits (ULs). Check labels carefully, look for third‑party certifications, and talk to your doctor before starting anything, especially if you’re on medication. Certain vitamins like D, calcium and omega‑3 can cause nausea, kidney problems or bleeding if overdosed. Keep doses moderate and always read the label."
