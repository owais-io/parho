title: "Trump’s Two Tactics Threaten U.S. Democracy"
summary: "This month, the U.S. military was accused of killing two survivors after bombing a drug‑smuggling boat, and Trump said it was illegal for Democrats to tell the military to refuse bad orders. The article explains that Trump’s second term is built on two tricks: (1) he pretends there’s a crisis to give himself extra powers, and (2) he tries to silence people who speak out. Courts and free‑speech groups are fighting back to keep the rule of law."
