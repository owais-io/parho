title: "More Seniors Are Becoming Homeless, Say Charities"
summary: "Charities are seeing a sharp rise in people over 60 who are homeless. Many are stuck sleeping in cars or emergency shelters and even dealing with illnesses like cancer. Cuts to council housing and a shortage of affordable homes mean older renters can’t afford rent and end up homeless. The problem has grown over five years, with rent hikes locking older people into unstable living situations. Experts say the government must protect seniors with better housing plans."
