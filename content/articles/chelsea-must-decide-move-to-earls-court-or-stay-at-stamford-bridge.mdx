title: "Chelsea Must Decide: Move to Earl’s Court or Stay at Stamford Bridge"
summary: "Chelsea’s owners are under pressure to decide whether to stay at Stamford Bridge or move to Earl’s Court, where a £10 bn housing plan has just received planning permission. The council’s approval leaves no space for a football stadium, and local politicians want the club to “put up or shut up.” The club could lose out to other buyers if they don’t act quickly. They still hope a partnership could make the move viable, but the decision remains pending."
