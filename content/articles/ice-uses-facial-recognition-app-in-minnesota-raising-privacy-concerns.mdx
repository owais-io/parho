title: "ICE Uses Facial Recognition App in Minnesota, Raising Privacy Concerns"
summary: "ICE agents in Minnesota are using a smartphone app called Mobile Fortify that scans faces and pulls data from federal and state databases. The app can misidentify people—especially women and people of color—and many say it’s used without consent. A lawsuit and congressional bill call for a ban, while critics argue the technology risks false arrests and violates privacy rights. Officials say the technology should only be a starting point; errors could lead to wrongful arrests."
