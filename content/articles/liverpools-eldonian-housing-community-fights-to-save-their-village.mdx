summary: "In Liverpool, residents built the Eldonian community village in the 1980s, owning 400 homes and shared facilities. As the area’s value grew, the charity that ran the village sold key assets to offshore companies and broke governance rules. Neighbours fought back, taking the case to the high court and the Charity Commission. A winding‑up petition was dismissed, but the charity’s finances are weak and more legal battles loom. Residents stay determined to protect their community."
