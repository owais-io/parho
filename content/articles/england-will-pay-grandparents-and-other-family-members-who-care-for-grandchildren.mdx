title: "England Will Pay Grandparents and Other Family Members Who Care for Grandchildren"
summary: "England has launched a three‑year pilot that will give grandparents, aunts, uncles and other family friends a weekly allowance for looking after their grandchildren. The payments, ranging from £170 to £299 a week, will help cover extra costs and are not means‑tested. The scheme is a step toward recognising the huge financial and emotional burden of kinship care, which keeps about 132,000 children in family homes instead of state care."
