title: "Workers face a tough climate as union rights wane under Trump"
summary: "In Philadelphia, Whole Foods workers won a first union vote, but their win is stalled because the federal agency that protects workers—the NLRB— is short of staff after Trump fired a board member. With no quorum, cases can’t be decided and many workers are left waiting. The agency’s limits and court rulings have made it harder for unions, while states like California are stepping in to help. Workers feel trapped and frustrated."
