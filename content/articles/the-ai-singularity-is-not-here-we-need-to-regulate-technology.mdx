title: "The AI Singularity Is Not Here – We Need to Regulate Technology"
summary: "Billboards in San Francisco brag about an AI “singularity,” and tech CEOs claim they’ve already built super‑intelligent machines. In reality, the new AI‑only social site Moltbook shows that the bots are still just programs copying human ideas, not true general intelligence. Researchers say AGI is far from reality and the hype is misleading. Big tech and the US government are pushing AI for profit and surveillance, but citizens can demand rules to keep it safe."
