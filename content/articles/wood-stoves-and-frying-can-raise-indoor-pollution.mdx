title: "Wood Stoves and Frying Can Raise Indoor Pollution"
summary: "While staying home during holidays may protect you from outside pollution, it can trap harmful air inside. New research shows wood‑stove fires and frying food can spike indoor particle levels. To keep air cleaner, fire less often, open the stove door slowly, and ventilate by opening windows or using an extractor fan. Avoid cooking or lighting a fire when anyone with asthma or other health problems is nearby. Small changes can reduce indoor smoke."
