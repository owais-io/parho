title: "Why the Decent Homes Standard Is Not Being Enforced"
summary: "The Guardian letter argues that the 2035 deadline for the Decent Homes Standard (DHS) is not the real problem – local councils already have the power to enforce it. The main issue is that they lack staff, training and clear guidance, and the new rules add legal complexity. Enforcement would fall to both council and social‑housing regulator, both of which are under‑resourced, so homes may remain unfit."
