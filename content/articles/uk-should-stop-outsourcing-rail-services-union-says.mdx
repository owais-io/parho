title: "UK should stop outsourcing rail services, union says"
summary: "Union leaders say the UK should stop outsourcing rail jobs like cleaning and security. Their research shows six big private firms made £152 m in profit last year, while workers say they get poorer pay and conditions. The rail minister says it’s time to rethink contracts and maybe bring work back in‑house. Labour’s manifesto promises a big shift to public ownership, but the government has yet to act on most rail services."
