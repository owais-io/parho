title: "Indonesia Blocks Elon Musk’s AI Chatbot Over Porn Risks"
summary: "Indonesia has temporarily blocked Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, after fears the tool could generate pornographic content, including child‑sexual images. It’s the first country to deny access to the AI. The startup has turned off its image‑creation feature for most users, keeping it only for paid subscribers while it works on safety fixes. Indonesian officials warned that non‑consensual deepfakes violate human rights, and other leaders, like Australia’s prime minister, have joined the criticism."
