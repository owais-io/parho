title: "Trump’s U.S. LNG is now the main gas source for Europe and the UK"
summary: "After Russia’s gas supplies were cut by Ukraine war sanctions, Europe and the UK have turned to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG). A study shows U.S. LNG now makes up almost 60% of EU gas imports and 68% of UK imports. Trump’s policy pushes for U.S. energy dominance, and he has even threatened tariffs to push allies toward his plans. Europe may need to speed up renewable energy to reduce this dependence."
