title: "Labour’s North Sea plan lets limited new drilling but keeps no‑new‑licence pledge"
summary: "Labour’s new North Sea strategy says it will keep its pledge not to issue new oil‑and‑gas licences, but it will allow limited drilling on existing fields through “tie‑back” certificates. The move is meant to keep current sites profitable while the basin ages, but environmental groups say the extra production is tiny. The budget also freezes fuel duty, adds a tax on electric cars, and shifts green levies into general taxation to cut household bills."
