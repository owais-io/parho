title: "Midterm Election Could Cut Trump’s Power and Spark Investigations"
summary: "The November mid‑term elections decide who controls Congress. If Democrats win the House, they can launch investigations into Trump’s administration and block his laws. A Senate win would stop him from filling key court and cabinet posts. Analysts see a “blue wave” driven by voter turnout, the economy and Trump’s low popularity, but redistricting battles could still swing the results."
