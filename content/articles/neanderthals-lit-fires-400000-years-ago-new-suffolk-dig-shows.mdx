title: "Neanderthals lit fires 400,000 years ago, new Suffolk dig shows"
summary: "A new find in Suffolk, England, shows Neanderthals were making fire around 400,000 years ago—almost 350,000 years before the first clear evidence from France. Scientists spotted burned earth, charred stone tools, and a rare spark‑making mineral that proves the fires were human‑made. This shows fire helped early humans survive in cold climates, expand, and maybe even spark language and social life. It changes how we think about human evolution."
