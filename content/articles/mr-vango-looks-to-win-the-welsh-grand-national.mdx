summary: "Mr Vango, a big, old‑school horse trained by Sara Bradstock, is a favorite to win the Welsh Grand National at Chepstow. He grew slowly, only racing from age six, and has won several big races including the London National and the Midlands Grand National. The old‑style, powerful steeplechaser is now looking to beat a strong field while carrying a top weight. Fans hope his classic style will bring an exciting victory."
