title: "Small farms alone can't solve hunger"
summary: "Small farms alone can't solve hunger. When SNAP was paused, millions rationed food. People expected small farms to help, but those farms also suffer: sales drop, costs rise, and they get little federal aid. Most subsidies target large farms and commodity crops, while programs that buy local produce for schools were cut. Small farms contribute to local jobs and keep money in the community. We need new policies that give them more support."
