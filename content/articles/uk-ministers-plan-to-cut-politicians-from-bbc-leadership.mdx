title: "UK Ministers Plan to Cut Politicians From BBC Leadership"
summary: "UK ministers want to make the BBC more independent by removing politicians from its board and changing how it gets money. They will review the BBC’s charter, which is renewed every ten years, and look at the licence fee. The move comes after complaints of political bias, the resignation of the BBC boss, and the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. The goal is a fair, non‑political broadcaster that can adapt to new media habits."
