title: "Report Says Response to 2024 Riots Ignored Causes and Racism"
summary: "An Institute of Race Relations report says the UK government’s handling of the 2024 summer riots missed the real causes and ignored links to racism. The paper argues the riots were often framed as random vandalism, while far‑right slogans and misinformation about the murder of three girls fed hate. It also criticises claims of ‘two‑tier justice’ and says courts treated many minority protesters harshly, calling for deeper, preventive work."
