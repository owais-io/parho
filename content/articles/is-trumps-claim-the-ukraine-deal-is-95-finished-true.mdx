title: "Is Trump’s claim the Ukraine deal is 95% finished true?"
summary: "Trump said the war‑ending deal with Russia was 95% finished, but the remaining 5% means he still needs Putin’s agreement – which is far from certain. He has promised quick victories before, and this claim feels another over‑optimistic promise. Ukraine’s president is skeptical, and Russia keeps saying the war ends only if it keeps control over Ukraine. The U.S. and Europe are trying to keep supporting Ukraine, but no real guarantees are in place."
