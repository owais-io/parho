summary: "Russia has long tried to influence Western politics, and a recent 10‑year jail term for former Reform politician Nathan Gill shows the problem is real. Cabinet minister Steve Reed says the UK’s election system isn’t strong enough and is ordering a review. The main issue is “dark money” – donations that hide their source, from offshore accounts to cryptocurrency. Experts say the government must tighten limits, strengthen the Electoral Commission, and close loopholes to stop foreign money buying influence."
