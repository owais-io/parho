title: "Rubio’s Munich Speech: Reassuring Europe or Expanding US Power?"
summary: "At the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a speech aimed at calming European concerns after last year’s criticism from Vice‑President Vance. Rubio praised shared heritage and said the U.S. wants to lead a Western renaissance, but the tone still pushes an American‑led empire. European leaders, alarmed by Russia’s war, are calling for greater EU defence and a more independent NATO."
