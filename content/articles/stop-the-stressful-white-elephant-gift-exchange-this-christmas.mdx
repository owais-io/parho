title: "Stop the Stressful White Elephant Gift Exchange This Christmas"
summary: "The article criticises the holiday white‑elephant gift swap, where people bring inexpensive presents, pile them together, and then pick or steal items. The writer says the game feels cruel, ruins good gifts, and turns parties into a wasteful, stressful affair. He argues that holiday joy should focus on spending time with friends and family, not a “musical‑chairs” contest, and calls for ending the tradition."
