title: "Trump Halts Immigration Visas for 75 Countries"
summary: "Trump’s administration has stopped processing immigration visas for people from 75 countries, saying those migrants are likely to use too much government help. The pause starts on Jan 21 and will last until the U.S. can be sure new immigrants won’t become a “public charge.” Critics say the claim isn’t backed by research and warn the move could scare families from asking for needed benefits. It’s part of a broader hard‑border push."
