title: "Post Office Skips £1.09m Fine After Data Leak of Wrongful Conviction Names"
summary: "The Post Office published the names and addresses of more than 500 workers it wrongly pursued during the Horizon IT scandal. The ICO found the leak was preventable and reprimanded the Post Office but decided not to fine it because the breach didn’t reach the “egregious” level. Human‑rights groups said this is a bad precedent, while the Post Office has already faced a £57.75m settlement over the wrongful prosecutions."
