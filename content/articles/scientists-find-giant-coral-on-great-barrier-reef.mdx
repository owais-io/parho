title: "Scientists Find Giant Coral on Great Barrier Reef"
summary: "Local divers spotted an enormous coral colony off Cairns, covering nearly 4,000 square metres—about half a soccer field. The Pavona clavus coral is one of the biggest ever recorded. It was found by a citizen‑science project that uses photos from the public to map reefs. Experts worry bleaching is shrinking such giants, and more research is needed to confirm if the structure is a single colony or several joined together."
