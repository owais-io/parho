title: "Ryde Pier: Watching Brent Geese"
summary: "In Ryde, a quiet pier in the Solent, a beached hovercraft and the smell of seaweed set the scene. Visitors eat fish and chips while watching 20 starlings, a wagtail, and a flock of brent geese. These small, gray‑and‑white geese—about 100,000 arrive each winter—grazes on eelgrass and sea plants. Their soft, low calls mingle with the wind, reminding us how important the birds are to the local winter landscape."
