title: "Norfolk Coast Builds the Largest Oyster Reef in Europe"
summary: "Allie Wharf, a former war reporter, now leads the Luna Oyster Project on Norfolk’s coast, building Europe’s largest natural oyster reef. The plan is to place 4 million oysters on clay “mother reef” bricks off the North Sea. Despite costly paperwork and careful care, the reef could clean water, protect the shoreline and create a new home for crabs, fish and other marine life. The project also creates jobs for local ecologists and supports companies like Purina."
