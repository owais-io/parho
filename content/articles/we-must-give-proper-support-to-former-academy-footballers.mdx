title: "We Must Give Proper Support to Former Academy Footballers"
summary: "Many young players in football academies work hard all their lives, but when their contracts end they can be left without help. Some even turn to crime or hurt themselves because of the sudden change. Support is uneven and usually gets worse the lower you go in the system. Experts say the FA, Premier League and EFL should put mental‑health support into academies from the start. That way every released player gets the help they need."
