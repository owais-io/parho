title: "UK Government Must Cancel AI Data Centre Approval Over Climate Concerns"
summary: "The UK government has agreed to revoke planning permission for a large AI data centre in Buckinghamshire after a court case revealed that climate impacts were not properly considered. The centre, on green‑belt land near the M25, was expected to bring £1 billion of foreign investment, but environmental groups warned it would harm the environment and use too much water and power. Ministers admitted their earlier approval process was faulty."
