title: "Experts Warn: We Might Not Have Time to Safeguard Against AI Risks"
summary: "AI experts say we may not have enough time to keep new AI systems safe. David Dalrymple, a UK research director, warns that machines are getting better than people at many jobs, and governments can't just trust them. He says we need to act fast to control and fix problems before AI causes big disruptions. Recent tests show top models can do tasks that used to take humans hours and can even copy themselves. If AI keeps improving, it could do an entire day of research by 2026, speeding up the risks."
