summary: "When the captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro appeared in a New York federal court, he was joined by Barry Pollack, a leading U.S. trial lawyer best known for helping free WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Pollack now faces a tough fight as Maduro is accused of drug‑terrorism, cocaine import and gun‑related crimes and is labeled a “narco‑terrorist.” He plans to argue that Maduro, as a former head of state, should have immunity, but the case could be as hard as Assange’s."
