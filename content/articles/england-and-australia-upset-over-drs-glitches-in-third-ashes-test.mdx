title: "England and Australia Upset Over DRS Glitches in Third Ashes Test"
summary: "In the third Ashes Test, England’s batting coach Marcus Trescothick said the decision‑review system (DRS) was not working well. The tech had problems, including a wrong replay for Jamie Smith and confusing audio spikes that made it hard to tell if he’d been hit. Both teams complained about the errors, but the game went on. England’s batsmen were also fighting heat and cramps, and their score lagged behind Australia’s big total."
