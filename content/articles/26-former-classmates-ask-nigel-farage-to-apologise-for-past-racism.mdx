summary: "Twenty‑six former pupils of Dulwich College have written an open letter demanding that Nigel Farage apologise for racist remarks he allegedly made while at the school in the 1970s. They say he told classmates that Hitler was right and that Jews should be gassed, and that he shouted hateful slogans.
