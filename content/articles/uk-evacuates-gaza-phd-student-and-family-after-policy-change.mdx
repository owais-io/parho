title: "UK Evacuates Gaza PhD Student and Family After Policy Change"
summary: "The UK finally moved Manar al‑Houbi, a Gaza student with a PhD scholarship, and her family to the UK after a recent policy shift. Earlier, the government had blocked most international students from bringing dependants. Houbi’s family now arrived in Jordan and will soon travel to the UK, becoming the only Gaza family to be escorted out so far. Other students still face uncertainty, with many stuck in Gaza and uncertain about future evacuation dates or academic plans."
