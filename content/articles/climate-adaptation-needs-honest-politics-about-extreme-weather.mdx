title: "Climate Adaptation Needs Honest Politics About Extreme Weather"
summary: "Extreme storms, heatwaves and wildfires prove that climate change makes bad weather more common. Scientists say we’re not doing enough to protect people. The UN wants richer nations to pay more for adaptation, but many countries want the money delayed and see no plan to make it happen. Poor nations need $310 billion a year by 2035, yet got only $26 billion last year. Adaptation is a political battle, not just a technical one."
