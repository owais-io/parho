title: "Developers Plan to Clear Woodland Home to Endangered Cockatoos"
summary: "In Perth, developers want to cut down a unique banksia forest that shelters threatened Baudin’s and Carnaby’s black cockatoos to build three new housing projects. They propose “offsets” by trying to grow a similar woodland elsewhere, but experts say that kind of ecosystem can’t be recreated from scratch. Conservation groups warn that this would leave the birds with no safe habitat and push the woodland closer to extinction."
