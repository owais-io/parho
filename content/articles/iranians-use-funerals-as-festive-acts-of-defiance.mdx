title: "Iranians Use Funerals as Festive Acts of Defiance"
summary: "In recent protests, many Iranians were killed by security forces. Their families now hold funerals that are loud, with pop music and dancing, to show defiance. Instead of sad, religious mourning, they celebrate the lives of their loved ones. This act challenges the regime’s rules that ban dancing and public singing. Authorities often charge money to release bodies and ask families to sign statements. Social media videos spread these jubilant, rebellious ceremonies."
