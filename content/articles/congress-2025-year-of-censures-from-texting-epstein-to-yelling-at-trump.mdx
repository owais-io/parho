title: "Congress’ 2025 Year of Censures – From Texting Epstein to Yelling at Trump"
summary: "In 2025, the House tried to censure 17 members over a year‑long flare‑up, but only one censure (against Rep. Dan Newhouse) actually passed. The attempts ranged from a Democrat calling Elon Musk a “dick,” to a Republican shouting at President Trump, to racist comments and jokes about a governor’s wheelchair. Many censures never got a vote, and lawmakers even proposed new rules to make future censures harder. The whole episode showed how heated the House has become."
