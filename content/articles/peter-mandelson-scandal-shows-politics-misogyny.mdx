title: "Peter Mandelson Scandal Shows Politics' Misogyny"
summary: "Peter Mandelson was named Britain’s ambassador to the U.S. even though he had a criminal record as a sexual predator. The story shows that politics often ignores women’s voices and keeps powerful men in power. Wes Streeting says the real problem is a toxic culture, not just bad paperwork. He urges leaders to listen to women, check vetting, and change behaviour so that women are heard and protected for everyone."
