title: "New Zealand Workers Missing a Summer Break"
summary: "The letter complains that most New Zealand workers aren’t able to take a proper summer vacation. It says people from various jobs—like retail, food service, and even professional staff—must keep working from Christmas until March. The writer feels that ordinary workers, who already earn low wages, don’t get a break while higher‑paid people do. The piece asks why the country lets its workers stay on duty for so long, instead of giving them a real summer holiday."
