summary: "The National Trust is making its grand houses feel more like home by letting people sit on some historic chairs and use the libraries for reading. Wightwick Manor and Blickling Estate already welcome visitors to sit and read, and more sites will add cushions or modern books. They’re also improving lighting and carefully choosing which furniture is safe to use. Outside the houses, the Trust plans wildlife screens in towns, wildlife releases, and new management of a Cornwall heritage site."
