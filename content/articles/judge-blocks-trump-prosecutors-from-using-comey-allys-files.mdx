title: "Judge Blocks Trump Prosecutors from Using Comey Ally’s Files"
summary: "A judge has stopped Trump prosecutors from using files that former FBI chief James Comey’s close friend, lawyer Daniel Richman, had on his computer. Richman sued the government after it accessed his computer during a 2020 probe into Comey. The judge says the government went back through those files without a new warrant, violating the Fourth Amendment. The order keeps the files off limits until December 12, making Comey’s potential re‑indictment even harder."
