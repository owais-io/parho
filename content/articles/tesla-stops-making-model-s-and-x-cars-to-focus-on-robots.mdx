summary: "Tesla has decided to stop building its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, turning the Fremont factory into a robot‑making plant. The change follows weak car sales and a shift toward artificial‑intelligence projects, like the Optimus robot and self‑driving taxis. Investors still cheered the news, but the company’s vehicle revenue fell 11% last year, and its future profits are uncertain. Musk also plans to sell Optimus to the public by 2027."
