title: "UK plans to simplify nuclear rules to speed up new reactors"
summary: "A taskforce set up by Prime Minister Keir Starmer has finished a plan to cut and speed up the rules that govern building new nuclear power plants. The report wants one single regulator and fewer planning hurdles, claiming this will keep safety high while making projects cheaper and faster. Some safety groups say cutting rules could be risky, but the government, industry leaders and pro‑nuclear groups all support the changes, arguing that the current system makes Britain the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear power."
