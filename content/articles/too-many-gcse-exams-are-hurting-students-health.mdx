title: "Too many GCSE exams are hurting students' health"
summary: "The letter argues that the many GCSE tests students take in a short period are putting their mental health at risk, with research linking exam stress at age 15 to later depression. While exams show what pupils know, England’s 16‑year‑olds sit in exam rooms longer than most peers. A recent 10 % cut is a small step. The writer urges a real overhaul—keep only essential subjects and drop the rest, especially in English, to stop the engagement crisis."
