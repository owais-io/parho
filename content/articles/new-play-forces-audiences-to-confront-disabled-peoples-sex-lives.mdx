title: "New play forces audiences to confront disabled people’s sex lives"
summary: "Robert Softley Gale, director of Birds of Paradise, has written a new play that forces audiences to think about disabled people’s sex lives. The story follows Ben, a young disabled student who lives with his parents and struggles with expectations about love and intimacy. The show includes explicit scenes, a live‑streaming sex‑work sequence and frank dialogue about sex work, kink and relationships. It uses humour and tough questions to break the myth that disabled people lack sexual agency."
