title: "FBI raid on Georgia election office was based on debunked claims"
summary: "The FBI raided Georgia’s Fulton County election office on January 28, seizing nearly 700 boxes of records. The raid was triggered by false claims from election‑deniers and a referral by a White House lawyer who tried to overturn the 2020 results. An affidavit shows the FBI relied on debunked allegations and conservative activists, none of which were supported by state audits. Officials say the raid was unnecessary and based on misinformation."
