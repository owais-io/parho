title: "Jim Ratcliffe’s chemicals firms got £70 million in UK government help"
summary: "The government gave Ineos, the chemical group owned by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, up to £70 million in state aid over the past four years. Last week it added another £50 million to keep the Grangemouth plant – the UK’s only ethylene plant – running. The aid mainly comes as tax breaks and loan guarantees to help the company deal with high energy costs after the Ukraine war. Ratcliffe says the help is not special treatment, but essential to keep the industry alive."
