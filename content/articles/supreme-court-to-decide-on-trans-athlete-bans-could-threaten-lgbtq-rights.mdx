title: "Supreme Court to Decide on Trans Athlete Bans, Could Threaten LGBTQ+ Rights"
summary: "On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments about state laws that ban trans girls from girls’ sports in West Virginia and Idaho. If the court sides with the states, it could set a precedent that makes it easier for other lawmakers to pass similar rules—like restricting bathroom use, changing names, or limiting protections for LGBTQ+ people. The case also tests whether trans people get special constitutional protection under Title IX and equal‑protection laws."
