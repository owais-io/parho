title: "Oil spills and gang violence turn Colombian wetlands into death zone"
summary: "Barrancabermeja, Colombia’s biggest oil town, is home to wetlands full of turtles, manatees and jaguars. But the state‑owned Ecopetrol refinery has spilled oil for decades, killing fish and wildlife and contaminating water that locals fish from for food. The problem is worse because gangs now steal gasoline and threaten fishermen. Activists say the oil company is covering up damage, and families are being pushed out of the area."
