title: "UK inflation drops to 3.2% as food prices ease"
summary: "In November, UK inflation fell to 3.2% from 3.6% in October, mainly because food prices like cakes and cereals dropped. The lower cost of tobacco and clothing also helped. This softer inflation makes the Bank of England likely to cut its interest rate from 4% to about 3.75%. Markets expect this, as weaker growth and a slow job market keep prices lower, with budget relief and holiday sales also playing a role."
