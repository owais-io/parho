title: "English & Welsh Graduates: Tell Us How You’re Handling Student Loan Repayments"
summary: "The UK budget has frozen the salary threshold for Plan 2 student loan repayments until 2027, meaning more borrowers will start paying earlier as they get raises. Student loans cover tuition and living costs, and interest builds up from the first payment until the debt is cleared. The government is asking graduates to share how they’re managing the debt, whether they’ve seen big rises in what they owe, and any worries they have."
