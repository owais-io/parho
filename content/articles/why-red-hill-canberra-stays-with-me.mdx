title: "Why Red Hill, Canberra, Stays With Me"
summary: "The writer talks about how Red Hill in Canberra feels like a personal sanctuary. With its walking tracks, scarred trees and ochre‑stained earth, it’s a place that sparks memories of childhood, family walks, and dogs running through the bush. The hill’s quiet, scenic views and wildlife make it a creative and meditative escape, especially after moving from Melbourne and starting a family. The piece is a heartfelt reflection on how a single spot can shape our sense of home."
