summary: "Labour wants to end jury trials in most cases, saying judges will handle more serious offences, but critics say the move could lead to more unfair outcomes for Black, Asian and minority ethnic people. The review that Lammy commissioned found higher conviction rates for BAME defendants in magistrates’ courts. Supporters argue juries act as a check on prejudice, while the government says court backlogs still need fixing."
