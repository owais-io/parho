title: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer buys Trump’s personalised silver cufflinks for £140"
summary: "Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, bought a pair of personalised silver cufflinks that were a gift from U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife during Trump’s September state visit. The cufflinks cost more than £140, so Starmer paid for them instead of letting the government keep them, following rules that say gifts over £140 must be bought by the recipient if they wish. This is the second Trump gift Starmer has chosen to purchase, after a necklace last year."
