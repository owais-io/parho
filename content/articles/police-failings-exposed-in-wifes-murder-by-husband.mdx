summary: "Gail Karran was killed by her husband, Bill, after he was let out of custody. Police let him home while knowing she had complained about abuse. They didn’t tell her he was free, didn’t check on her safety, and treated her death as a simple accident. A Guardian investigation found the police missed crucial evidence, ignored her calls, and delayed the search of their house. The case shows serious gaps in protecting domestic‑violence victims."
