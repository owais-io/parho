title: "Patagonia Wildfires: Fires, Budget Cuts, and Wrong Blame"
summary: "In Patagonia, huge wildfires have scorched more than 36,000 hectares of forest, grassland and villages. The fires are harder to fight because of cheap, highly flammable pine plantations and a climate crisis. Argentina’s President Milei has cut firefighting budgets by 81 %, leaving crews underpaid and under‑equipped. Meanwhile, officials wrongly blame Mapuche people and even Jews, spreading false conspiracies. Local farmers and firefighters are stepping up to fight the blaze together."
