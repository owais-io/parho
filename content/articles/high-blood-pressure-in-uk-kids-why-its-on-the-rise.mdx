title: "High blood pressure in UK kids: why it’s on the rise"
summary: "High blood pressure, once mainly an adult problem, is now rising in children and teens. Doctors say it’s caused by genetics, weight gain, a salty diet and little exercise. It can quietly damage the heart, kidneys and eyes, even in the young. Kids are checked by comparing their readings to others of the same age and height. Cutting salt, staying active and keeping a healthy weight are the best ways to keep pressure low."
