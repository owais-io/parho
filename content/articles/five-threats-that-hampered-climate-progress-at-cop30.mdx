title: "Five threats that hampered climate progress at COP30"
summary: "COP30 ended late in Belém, Brazil, under rain and political tension. While some agreements were made, the summit fell short of limiting warming to 1.5°C, missed money for climate‑adaptation, and barely mentioned forest protection. Five main problems stood in the way: the U.S. left, China didn't lead, Brazil was split on deforestation, Europe didn't give enough finance, and wars and old UN rules slowed action. Still, more voices were heard and clean‑energy talks advanced."
