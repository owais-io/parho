title: "Cow Uses Broom to Scratch Its Own Back – First Tool Use in Cattle"
summary: "A 13‑year‑old Swiss cow named Veronika has been seen using a broom to scratch her own back and belly, a first example of tool use in cattle. Scientists say this shows cows can flexibly manipulate objects to reach places they can't touch themselves. The story fits into a long list of animals that use tools – from chimpanzees to otters and even crows. It reminds us that many animals are smarter than we think."
