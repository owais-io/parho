title: "Valentine’s Day Flowers: Go Local, Go Green"
summary: "This year, the most‑sold flowers on Valentine’s Day in Australia are red roses that are flown in from overseas. The long trip, chemicals, and plastic packaging give the flowers a big carbon and pollution cost. Flower bosses say more people want locally grown, seasonal blooms that use fewer pesticides and less plastic. Options include daisies, hydrangeas, or native seeds, which taste fresher and are kinder to the planet."
