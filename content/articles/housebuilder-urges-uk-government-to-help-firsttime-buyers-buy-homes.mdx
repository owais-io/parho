title: "Housebuilder urges UK government to help first‑time buyers buy homes"
summary: "The chief executive of Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, asked the government to introduce tax breaks or a help‑to‑buy loan to make it easier for people buying their first home. She said the end of the stamp‑duty holiday has cooled the market and that support would help the economy and reach the goal of building 1.5 million homes. She also warned that too many new regulations could make it too expensive to build houses, especially in poorer areas."
