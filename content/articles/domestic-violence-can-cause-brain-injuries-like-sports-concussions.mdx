title: "Domestic violence can cause brain injuries like sports concussions"
summary: "An Australian study shows that women who face repeated head blows or strangulation in abusive relationships suffer brain injuries like those athletes get after concussions. The damage leads to memory loss, learning problems, seizures and slurred speech. Most survivors had both strangulation and mild brain injury, yet many go undiagnosed. Doctors and services must screen for these injuries and help survivors, while early action can prevent long‑term harm."
