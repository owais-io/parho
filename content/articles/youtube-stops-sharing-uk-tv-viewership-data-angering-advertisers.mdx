title: "YouTube Stops Sharing UK TV Viewership Data, Angering Advertisers"
summary: "YouTube has stopped sharing its UK TV viewership data after sending cease‑and‑desist letters to the industry’s main audience‑measurement firm, Barb, and its partner Kantar. The move has angered broadcasters, advertisers and the advertising trade body ISBA, who rely on cross‑media stats to sell ad space. YouTube had been including viewers on smart TVs, and its UK audience now tops the BBC, but the company says the service isn’t a good fit for its terms."
