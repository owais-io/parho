summary: "28 human‑rights groups sent letters to four airlines, urging them to stop flights that send asylum seekers back to France under the UK’s “one‑in‑one‑out” scheme. They called the airlines complicit in cruel deportations and demanded a boycott of Air France, while the others must publicly say they’ll stop. Many deportees were in distress, some on hunger strikes, and the UK faces a high‑court challenge that could halt the policy."
