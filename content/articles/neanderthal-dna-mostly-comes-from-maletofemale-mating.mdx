title: "Neanderthal DNA Mostly Comes from Male‑to‑Female Mating"
summary: "Scientists found that when Neanderthals and modern humans interbred, most of the couples involved a Neanderthal man and a human woman. That explains why Neanderthal genes are missing from the human X chromosome. By comparing DNA from three Neanderthal skeletons with modern African genomes, researchers saw a 62 % excess of human DNA on Neanderthal X chromosomes, pointing to a mating bias."
