title: "Spot the Sea Monster Constellation Cetus Tonight"
summary: "Cetus is a huge but faint constellation that covers a lot of sky. You can spot it from almost anywhere because it sits near the celestial equator. Mythically, it’s the sea monster that Perseus turned into stone. Even though it has no bright stars, it has a special star called Mira that brightens and fades every year. Right now Mira is dim, but it will shine again soon."
