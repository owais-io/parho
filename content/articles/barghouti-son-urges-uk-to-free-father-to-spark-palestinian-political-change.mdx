title: "Barghouti son urges UK to free father to spark Palestinian political change"
summary: "Barghouti's son says the UK should free his father, a long‑time Palestinian prisoner, to spark real political change. He argues Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state is meaningless unless it works to release Marwan Barghouti, who could lead a fresh democratic movement. British MPs are pushing for his release, but the Foreign Office has stayed quiet, while Israeli courts keep him jailed after a controversial 2003 conviction."
