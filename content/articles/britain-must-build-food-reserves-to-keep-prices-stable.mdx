title: "Britain Must Build Food Reserves to Keep Prices Stable"
summary: "Many countries are stockpiling food to shield against price spikes caused by climate, war and supply‑chain problems. The UK relies on markets and has no large reserves, so when prices rise people still need food and prices stay high. Reserves can smooth costs and protect households. China misused stocks, India used them wisely. The UK should follow other European nations and build strategic food reserves for resilience."
