title: "The NHS is Invaluable and the Guardian’s Letters Cover Everything Else"
summary: "The Guardian’s letters column has a mix of personal stories and light‑hearted commentary. One reader shares how their husband’s life was saved by NHS care, calling it priceless. Another criticises a headline about celebrity‑driven TV shows. A reader worries about a ban on Médecins Sans Frontières in Gaza. Some letters poke fun at confusing style guide terms like “Twixtmas” and compare odd measurements. Readers are encouraged to send in their own thoughts for future letters."
