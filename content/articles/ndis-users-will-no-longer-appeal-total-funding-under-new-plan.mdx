title: "NDIS users will no longer appeal total funding under new plan"
summary: "The NDIS will use a computer‑driven system to create support plans, removing staff from the decision. Under the new rules, people cannot appeal the total funding amount to the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART). Instead, the ART can only send the plan back to the NDIA for another assessment. The change is aimed at cutting costs, but senators were frustrated by unclear explanations from NDIA officials."
