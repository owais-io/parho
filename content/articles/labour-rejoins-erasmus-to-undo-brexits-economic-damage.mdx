title: "Labour Rejoins Erasmus to Undo Brexit's Economic Damage"
summary: "Labour is bringing Britain back into Europe by re‑joining the Erasmus+ youth exchange, opening doors for students, apprentices and school groups. The move is part of a wider push to undo the economic damage caused by Brexit. Critics say the programme costs £570m, but studies show Brexit costs the economy far more—up to £90bn a year. The party also wants better trade rules for food exporters, like lamb and beef, to avoid future roadblocks."
