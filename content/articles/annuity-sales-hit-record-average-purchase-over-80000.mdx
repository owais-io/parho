title: "Annuity Sales Hit Record, Average Purchase Over £80,000"
summary: "Annuity sales in the UK jumped 4% to £7.4bn in 2025, the biggest ever, thanks to a new inheritance tax rule. The rule means unused pension money could be taxed if it stays in a pension after someone dies. To avoid this, people are buying annuities, turning their pension pot into guaranteed income. Average annuity purchase is now over £80,000, giving better rates than before."
