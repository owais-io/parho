title: "NDIS call‑centre workers forced to pose as public servants, but lack training, says workers"
summary: "Workers at a private company that runs the NDIS phone lines say they have to pretend they are government employees. They decide which urgent funding requests go up the chain, even though they have no disability‑training or financial know‑how. Their pay and conditions are lower than public‑service staff, and they can’t tell callers they’re from a private firm. The arrangement has drawn criticism for hurting both callers and staff."
