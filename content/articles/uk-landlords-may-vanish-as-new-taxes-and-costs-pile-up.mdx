title: "UK landlords may vanish as new taxes and costs pile up"
summary: "The UK government will raise the tax on rental income by 2 % from April 2027, making landlords pay 22 % to 47 % on their profits. Coupled with higher interest rates, stricter rules, and extra costs, many small landlords are leaving the market. In 2025, landlord‑owned homes fell to the lowest level since 2007, while more first‑time buyers are getting houses. The loss of landlords could raise rents over time."
