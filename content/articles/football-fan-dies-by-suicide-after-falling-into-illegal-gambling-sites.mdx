summary: "Ollie Long, a 36‑year‑old Liverpool fan, died by suicide in February after an eight‑year gambling addiction. He started betting with licensed bookmakers, signed up for GamStop to stop gambling, but then used illegal offshore sites that target self‑excluded players. Family said the addiction caused his death, though the coroner recorded suicide and “multiple injuries” as the official cause. The case has prompted calls for stronger action against unlicensed gambling and for Meta to remove related ads."
