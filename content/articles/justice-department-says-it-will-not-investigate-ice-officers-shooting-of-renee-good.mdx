title: "Justice Department says it will not investigate ICE officer’s shooting of Renee Good"
summary: "The U.S. Justice Department says it will not investigate the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis, even though the death was filmed by many phones. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the video shows the officer acted in self‑defense, and that the department only opens investigations when “appropriate.” This stance contrasts sharply with the 2020 inquiry into George Floyd’s death, which led to criminal charges. The decision has sparked criticism and resignations among federal prosecutors."
