title: "What Will Decide the Super Bowl: Star Receiver, Pass Protection and Big Plays"
summary: "The game comes down to a few things. Seattle’s Jaxon Smith‑Njigba is the biggest threat, so New England will try to double‑team him and protect their rookie linemen. The Patriots’ pass rush will have to stay strong, while the Seahawks want to keep their offense unbalanced and slow the ball. Both teams rely on a few big plays, so the final outcome may hinge on a single turnover or long pass."
