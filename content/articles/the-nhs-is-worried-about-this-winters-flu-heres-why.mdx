title: "The NHS is worried about this winter’s flu – here’s why"
summary: "Flu is arriving earlier than usual, hitting hospitals hard in December instead of the usual January peak. A new H3N2 variant means the yearly vaccine isn’t a perfect match, but it still protects many people. Only about 40‑45% of at‑risk groups in the NHS are jabbed, and private pharmacies are low on shots, making it costly and hard to get. The NHS is already stretched, so more flu cases could push it over the edge. Get vaccinated before the holidays."
