title: "How the U.S. Built Military Bases in Greenland"
summary: "The U.S. began defending Greenland in 1941 after an agreement with Denmark, fearing German plans to use the island as an airbase. This move helped Britain and was part of the U.S. “defence of the western hemisphere.” During the Cold War, the U.S. and Denmark signed further agreements to share control, build new airfields, and place U.S. troops there. In 1968 a B‑52 carrying hydrogen bombs crashed, leading to a cleanup of radioactive snow. These events show how Greenland became a key U.S. military hub."
