title: "Scottish Court Reviews Policy on Transgender Prisoners in Women’s Jails"
summary: "Scottish courts are reviewing a policy that lets some transgender inmates stay in women’s prisons. A campaign group says the rule violates a Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman by biological sex. The challenge points out that men who identify as women, some convicted of serious crimes, have been placed with vulnerable female inmates. The case could change how prisons house transgender prisoners now."
