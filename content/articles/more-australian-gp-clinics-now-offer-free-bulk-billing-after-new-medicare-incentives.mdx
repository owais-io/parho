title: "More Australian GP clinics now offer free bulk billing after new Medicare incentives"
summary: "More Australian GP clinics now offer free bulk billing after new Medicare incentives, a study shows. Between November 2025 and mid‑December, the share of clinics that bulk‑bill all patients jumped from 20.7% to 40.2%, with about 1,000 practices switching to full bulk billing. The move helped some rural areas, but doctors and critics say the boost still misses the poorest patients and doesn't fix deeper funding problems."
