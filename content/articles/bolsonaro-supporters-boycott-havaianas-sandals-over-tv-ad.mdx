summary: "Brazil’s far‑right supporters started a boycott of Havaianas sandals after actress Fernanda Torres said in a TV commercial, “don’t start 2026 on the right foot, but with both feet.” They saw the line as a jab at the right wing. Eduardo Bolsonaro even threw away a pair. The backlash cost Havaianas about £20 million in value.
