summary: "Sir Keir Starmer’s approval has plunged into negative territory, and his stubborn response after almost being ousted shows he isn’t taking responsibility. Analysts say Britain’s growth will stay weak, and voters may start looking elsewhere. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper propose sweeping changes: a new growth department, regional control, and even a reformed Senate. Their ideas echo a growing demand for fresh politics, but Starmer’s government seems stuck in the old model."
