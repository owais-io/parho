title: "Australia’s Hate‑Speech Bill May Target Critics of Israel"
summary: "Australia’s new hate‑speech law has raised fears that it could criminalise criticism of Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The Greens argue the bill, hurried after the Bondi terror attacks, expands powers to ban groups and punish ridicule or contempt, potentially chilling free speech. The government says it protects Australians, especially Jews, but amendments to clarify limits failed, leaving uncertainty about how the law will be applied."
