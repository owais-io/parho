title: "Air Pollution Kills Thousands Each Year – Why We’re Not Acting Harder"
summary: "WHO says almost all people breathe air that’s too dirty, causing about 7 million deaths each year. In Delhi, smog can cut life expectancy by 12 years and is linked to heart attacks, strokes and childhood brain damage. London’s low‑emission zones have cut nitrogen oxides, but many UK towns still breach safe limits. The article calls for stricter rules, stops idling engines and limits wood‑burning stoves, because breathing exercises can’t fix bad air. These measures could save thousands of lives each year."
