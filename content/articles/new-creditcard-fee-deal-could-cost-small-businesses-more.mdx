title: "New Credit‑Card Fee Deal Could Cost Small Businesses More"
summary: "Small stores have long complained about the high cost of taking card payments. A recent settlement with Visa and Mastercard “cuts fees,” but the trick is that fees will now differ by card type. Merchants may have to reject certain cards, add extra charges, or drop reward programs that bring in new customers. The result is more hidden costs for businesses and fewer incentives for shoppers to use their cards."
