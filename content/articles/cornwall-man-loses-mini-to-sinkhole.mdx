title: "Cornwall Man Loses Mini to Sinkhole"
summary: "Cornwall man Malcolm McKenzie lost his Mini when it fell into a 3‑metre wide sinkhole. The hole may be from an old mine and the land has no registered owner, so the council can’t lift the fences until ownership is sorted. McKenzie has been stuck in paperwork for almost a month. The council will eventually help him remove the car, but it’s likely wrecked and will probably be written off."
