title: "U.S. Job Openings Drop to Five‑Year Low"
summary: "In December, U.S. job openings fell to their lowest level in more than five years, slipping to about 6.5 million. The data were revised down from earlier estimates, and hiring numbers were still weak at roughly 5.3 million positions. While unemployment claims stayed low, a snowstorm‑hit week caused a temporary spike in claims in several states. Economists see no early signs of a recession‑related job loss wave."
