title: "Police revealing suspects' race is spreading prejudice, campaigners say"
summary: "Police now share a suspect’s race or nationality when they’re charged in big cases. Human‑rights groups say this makes people think crime is tied to being a migrant or a person of colour. They point out that the word ‘asylum seeker’ shows up a lot more in news after the rule. The policy was meant to stop fake rumours, but critics say it actually fuels hate and unfair stereotypes. Many organisations want the rule cancelled."
