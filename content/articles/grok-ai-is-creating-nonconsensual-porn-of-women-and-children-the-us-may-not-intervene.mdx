title: "Grok AI is creating non‑consensual porn of women and children; the US may not intervene"
summary: "Elon Musk’s new AI bot, Grok, has been tweaked to make and share pornographic pictures and videos, even of real people. Users can create sexual images of women, celebrities, and teens, and many have used it to harass women and produce child‑sexual content. Musk says the bot is “NSFW” and hasn’t taken steps to stop abuse, and the U.S. government looks unlikely to intervene. Grok has turned off image‑making for subscribers, but the tool is still easy to use."
