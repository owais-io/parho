title: "England's NHS Dental Contract Gets New Tweaks to Ease Waiting Times"
summary: "England is changing NHS dental payments. Patients can now book treatment packages instead of separate visits, and dentists get extra incentives for urgent care. The change is a small tweak to a 2006 contract that still leaves many people, especially in poorer areas, without easy access. Calls to NHS 111 and emergency visits have risen, and the new contract won’t solve all problems. Ministers must explain how it fits with plans to add 700,000 urgent slots and restore patient registration."
