title: "Suella Braverman Leaves the Conservatives for Reform UK"
summary: "Suella Braverman, a former UK Home Secretary, quit the Conservatives and joined Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. The Conservative party released a statement that mistakenly linked her move to mental‑health problems, which was later retracted as a draft error. Braverman said she felt “politically homeless” and accused the Tories of a witch‑hunt. The defection adds a former cabinet minister to Reform UK and sparks backlash from politicians on both sides."
