title: "Eagles Coach Defends Jalen Hurts After Losing Streak"
summary: "After a rough 22‑19 loss to the Chargers, where quarterback Jalen Hurts threw four interceptions, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said it was ridiculous to talk about benching him. Despite the team’s three‑game losing streak and a low scoring average, Sirianni remains confident in Hurts, saying the offense can win together. With no other QB seen as a serious replacement, the Eagles head into their next game against the Raiders hoping to turn things around."
