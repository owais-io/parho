title: "Labour Could Repeat Caerphilly Mistakes in Gorton Byelection"
summary: "In three weeks, voters in Gorton and Denton will head to the polls. The race looks a lot like last October’s Caerphilly byelection, where a safe Labour seat was lost to Plaid Cymru after voters felt Labour wasn’t the best way to stop Reform. The Greens are seen as the main anti‑Reform option, and Labour must avoid repeating the same mistakes in messaging, spending and voter engagement."
