title: "NSW may let Jewish security guards carry guns after Bondi attack"
summary: "After a gun attack on a Jewish festival in Bondi, NSW Premier Chris Minns said the state might let the Community Security Group (CSG) – a Jewish security body – carry firearms at events. CSG already has armed staff at schools and synagogues, but would be given permission to have guns on site for public events, with a plan to keep everyone safe if police arrive. Police and experts warn this could blur lines between private guards and law‑enforcement, and suggest a different approach."
