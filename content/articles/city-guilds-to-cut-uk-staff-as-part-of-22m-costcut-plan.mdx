summary: "City & Guilds, the historic UK training body, is shrinking its staff to save £22 million after being sold to a Greek company, PeopleCert. The plan will cut about 340 jobs per year, moving a third to cheaper Greek offices and letting others go without replacement. The goal is to lower UK pay costs and turn the charity into a leaner, more profitable organization. The sale will give City & Guilds a large fund to keep supporting skills training."
