title: "UK plans health warnings for new wood‑burning stoves"
summary: "UK officials want every new wood‑burning stove to carry a clear health warning about the air pollution it creates. They plan to slash the allowed smoke by 80%, from 5 g to 1 g per hour, and add an A‑C energy‑efficiency label. The rule only covers new stoves, which already meet the limit, so overall toxic emissions will fall just 10% over ten years. Clean‑air groups say it ignores older, more polluting stoves and call for stronger action."
