title: "EU must decide whether to use frozen Russian money to aid Ukraine"
summary: "EU leaders are meeting in Brussels to decide if they should use frozen Russian money to help Ukraine fight Russia. Germany wants to use the frozen assets as collateral for a loan, while Belgium and others worry about legal risks and prefer borrowing from the EU budget instead. The debate is urgent because Russia is still attacking Ukraine, and a decision could give Kyiv a large loan for two years. Some countries fear the plan could backfire or provoke retaliation."
