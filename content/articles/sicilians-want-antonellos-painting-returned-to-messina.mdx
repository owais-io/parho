title: "Sicilians Want Antonello's Painting Returned to Messina"
summary: "After buying a small 15th‑century painting by Antonello da Messina from a New York auction for almost €13 million, the Italian culture ministry must decide where it will hang. Milan, Venice and Naples are in the running, but locals in Messina – the painter’s hometown – want it back. The city was devastated by a 1908 earthquake that destroyed many of the artist’s works, so restoring the painting there would heal a cultural wound."
