title: "France’s insect‑eating birds are slowly rebounding after pesticide ban"
summary: "A new study shows that France’s insect‑eating birds, like blackbirds and chaffinches, have grown a little after the EU banned a common insect pesticide in 2018. Bird numbers rose about 2‑3% between 2019 and 2022, suggesting the ban helped the birds. The research used data from nearly 2,000 survey sites and found that places still using the pesticide had fewer birds. While the recovery is small, it shows that cutting harmful chemicals can benefit wildlife."
