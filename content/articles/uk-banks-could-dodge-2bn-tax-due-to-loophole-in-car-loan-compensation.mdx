title: "UK banks could dodge £2bn tax due to loophole in car loan compensation"
summary: "A loophole lets UK banks and their motor‑finance subsidiaries avoid paying about £2 billion in corporation tax on the money they will pay to car‑loan customers. The rule, introduced in 2015, blocks banks from cutting compensation out of their taxable profits, but it doesn’t apply to non‑bank arms of banks or specialist lenders. MPs and the Treasury are warning that the scheme for £11 billion in car‑loan redress could let lenders save the tax, hurting taxpayers."
