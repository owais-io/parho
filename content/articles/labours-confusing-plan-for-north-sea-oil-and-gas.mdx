title: "Labour's Confusing Plan for North Sea Oil and Gas"
summary: "Labour says it won’t grant new North Sea licences, but will keep existing fields running as long as possible. The plan would let companies use current rigs and pipelines, but the Treasury is holding onto a 78 % tax levy until 2030, which could stop investment and jobs. The two parts clash, and the party hasn’t set clear production targets. The mix leaves the UK’s energy future and job market in a state of confusion."
