title: "Dozens of People Die After Record Snowfall in Japan"
summary: "Japan has seen a record‑breaking snowstorm that has killed more than 30 people and left almost 400 injured. Most deaths came from people falling while clearing roofs or stuck in ski lift accidents. The heavy snow, which has covered some areas in 2‑metre depth, has cut off electricity and trains, making it hard for emergency crews to reach those in trouble. Officials warn that as the snow melts, the risk of avalanches and slips will rise, so everyone should stay alert and use safety gear."
