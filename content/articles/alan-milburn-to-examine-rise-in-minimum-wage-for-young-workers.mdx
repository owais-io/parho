title: "Alan Milburn to examine rise in minimum wage for young workers"
summary: "Former health secretary Alan Milburn has launched a review of the UK’s rising minimum wage for 16‑to‑24‑year‑olds. He says the higher rates risk pushing young people out of entry‑level jobs and could create a “lost generation.” Milburn wants the report to tackle real problems in the labour market, mental‑health claims, and the welfare system. He urges the government to give young workers better chances to learn and earn, and warns that failing to help them may push them toward right‑wing politics."
