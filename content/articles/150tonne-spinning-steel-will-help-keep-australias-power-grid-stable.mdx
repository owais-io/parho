title: "150‑tonne spinning steel will help keep Australia’s power grid stable"
summary: "In western Victoria, a huge 150‑tonne machine called a synchronous condenser is turning for the first time. It spins a big rotor to help steady the electricity grid, like a giant “flywheel” that smooths out power surges. The unit will let more renewable energy feed in without extra fossil‑fuel plants. It costs about $137 million and is part of Victoria’s $480 million upgrade to modernise the grid. A study says up to 40 of these could be needed for a fully renewable system."
