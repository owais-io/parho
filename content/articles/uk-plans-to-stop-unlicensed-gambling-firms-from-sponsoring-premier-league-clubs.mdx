title: "UK plans to stop unlicensed gambling firms from sponsoring Premier League clubs"
summary: "The UK government is consulting on a ban that would prevent unlicensed gambling operators from sponsoring Premier League football clubs. Premier League clubs already agreed to remove front‑of‑shirt gambling deals, but unlicensed firms could still sponsor sleeves or other spots. Critics say these operators lack proper regulation, can expose vulnerable gamblers, and have links to organised crime. A major example is Everton’s deal with Stake.com, which lost its licence but still sponsors the club. This move would close that loophole."
