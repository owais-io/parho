summary: "The UK defence ministry will start a paid two‑year gap‑year scheme for people under 25, kicking off in March 2026. A pilot of 150 youngsters will join the army, navy or RAF for training, learning skills that can be used anywhere – they won’t be sent into combat or stuck with a military job afterward. The plan could grow to more than 1,000 places a year, offering a new way to show young people what life in the armed forces is like."
