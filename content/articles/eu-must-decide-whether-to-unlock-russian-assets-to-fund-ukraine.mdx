title: "EU Must Decide Whether to Unlock Russian Assets to Fund Ukraine"
summary: "The European Council is deciding what to do with £184 billion of Russian assets frozen across Europe. Ukraine needs money, but the move is tangled in legal, economic and political issues. The EU proposes a loan that uses the assets’ value without giving them to Kyiv, but Russia, the U.S., and even some EU members worry about legal challenges and future consequences. The decision could shape how the EU helps Ukraine today and its standing in future global conflicts."
