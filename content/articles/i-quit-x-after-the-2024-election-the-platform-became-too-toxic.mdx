title: "I Quit X After the 2024 Election: The Platform Became Too Toxic"
summary: "I left X (formerly Twitter) because it turned into a hub for harassment, hate, and shady content after Elon Musk took control. The constant abuse and a lack of accountability pushed me to quit after the 2024 U.S. election. Even though many people stayed, I saw extremist posts, AI‑generated sexual images, and a toxic community. I now recommend moving to other services or simply stepping away."
