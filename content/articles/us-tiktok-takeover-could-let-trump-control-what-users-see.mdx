title: "US TikTok takeover could let Trump control what users see"
summary: "TikTok’s new U.S. algorithm is now run by a group of U.S. tech investors, including Oracle. The change is meant to keep U.S. data safe, but many users worry it could let political leaders, like Trump, hide or push certain videos. Reports of videos about controversial topics disappearing, low‑view counts, and blocked keywords have sparked calls for a review. The new system could bias what people see and limit free speech."
