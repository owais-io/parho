title: "Thailand Cuts Sugar in Popular Drinks to Boost Health"
summary: "Thailand is cutting the sugar in its most popular drinks. The government has asked big coffee chains to cut the sugar in their normal drinks in half. Thai people use about 21 teaspoons of sugar a day, far more than the WHO’s limit. A past sugar tax pushed manufacturers to lower sugar, but street‑vended drinks are still high. The new plan will let cafés offer lower‑sugar options, nudging customers toward less sweet drinks."
