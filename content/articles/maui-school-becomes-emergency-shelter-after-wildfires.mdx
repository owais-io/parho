title: "Maui School Becomes Emergency Shelter After Wildfires"
summary: "After Maui’s 2023 wildfires, the principal of a small prep school sent students home, but the whole town was in chaos. Power and phones went out, so the school opened its doors to hundreds of evacuees, turning classrooms into a makeshift shelter. Volunteers, neighbours, and even strangers brought food, water and clothes. The teachers kept a calm, caring environment while the community showed huge generosity, helping those still dealing with the fire’s trauma."
