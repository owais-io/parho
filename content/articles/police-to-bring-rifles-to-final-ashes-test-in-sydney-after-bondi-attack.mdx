title: "Police to bring rifles to final Ashes Test in Sydney after Bondi attack"
summary: "Police will carry long‑arm rifles at the final Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground as part of a larger security boost following the Bondi beach terror attack. It isn’t because of an active threat, the commissioner said, but to make fans feel safer. Similar rifle‑carrying measures were used at Melbourne’s Boxing Day Test and Sydney’s New Year’s Eve. The state is also looking at extra guard troops and giving Jewish security groups more firepower. A 48,000‑strong crowd is expected, and a tribute to responders will take place before play."
