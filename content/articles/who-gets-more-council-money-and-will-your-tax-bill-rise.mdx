title: "Who Gets More Council Money and Will Your Tax Bill Rise?"
summary: "England’s councils have a new three‑year budget plan that uses a Fair Funding formula. It gives more money to areas with high deprivation, like Middlesbrough, Manchester and Birmingham, while wealthier places such as Kensington‑Chelsea and Surrey get less. Most councils will raise tax bills to the 4.99% limit next April, even if some try to keep them low. The extra funds may help some councils avoid bankruptcy, but many still face rising costs and could need extra help from the government."
