title: "Half a Million English People Hospitalised for Pneumonia Each Year"
summary: "England now sees more than 580,000 people needing emergency care for pneumonia every year – up a quarter since 2022. The surge strains A&E departments and adds to rising health costs. Many cases are preventable and hit poorer communities hardest, because of damp homes and lack of basic care. The charity Asthma + Lung UK says better routine checks, action plans and vaccines are needed. NHS is boosting remote monitoring and community support to curb winter spikes."
