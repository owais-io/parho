title: "Correction: 45% of English Babies Are Born by C‑Section, Not 44%"
summary: "An article wrongly claimed 44% of babies in England are born by C‑section and 45% vaginal. The correction shows 45% are C‑section and 44% unassisted vaginal; with assisted vaginal births added, 55% are vaginal. The notice also corrects other stories—police seized art posters, a Georgia town protested ICE detention, UK weather, Ukraine‑Russia talks—and invites reader feedback."
