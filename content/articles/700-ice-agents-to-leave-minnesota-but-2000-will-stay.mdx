title: "700 ICE agents to leave Minnesota, but 2,000 will stay"
summary: "White House immigration czar Tom Homan said about 700 federal agents will leave Minnesota, though roughly 2,000 will remain. The move comes as county sheriffs negotiate plans to hold undocumented people for up to 48 hours before ICE can pick them up, hoping to cut street patrols. Local leaders—state governor, city mayor, and senators—criticise the number still on the ground and demand a quicker drawdown and investigations into recent killings by ICE."
