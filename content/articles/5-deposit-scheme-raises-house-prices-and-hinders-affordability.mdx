title: "5% Deposit Scheme Raises House Prices and Hinders Affordability"
summary: "Australia’s 5% deposit guarantee has pushed more first‑time buyers into the market, but the loans they take are getting bigger—average home loans rose 8% in three months, reaching $607,545. Prices have climbed because lenders are handing out more money, and investors are also buying houses. The scheme has made buying a home harder and costlier, hurting affordability. This has sparked debate about whether the government should cut the capital gains tax discount, which many say fuels speculation and inflates prices."
