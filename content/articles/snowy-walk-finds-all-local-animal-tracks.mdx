title: "Snowy Walk Finds All Local Animal Tracks"
summary: "Rosie and her family walked through a snowy field and spotted many animal tracks. Using a phone app, they tried to identify the prints, which named coyotes (probably foxes), rabbits, horses, badgers, deer, and bird footprints. Crows were seen in the trees and moorhens paddled on the canal the next day. The walk was a pleasant exploration of nature. It reminded them how busy the countryside stays, even in winter."
