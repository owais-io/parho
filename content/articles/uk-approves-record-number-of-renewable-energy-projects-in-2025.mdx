title: "UK Approves Record Number of Renewable Energy Projects in 2025"
summary: "Great Britain gave the green light to a record 45GW of new batteries, wind and solar in 2025, a 96% jump from 2024. Battery projects nearly doubled, offshore wind grew sevenfold, and the five‑year trend shows more than 400% growth. But the grid can’t yet handle all the power, so many projects are still stuck waiting for connections. New rules aim to speed up the process, yet more investment and better grid upgrades are needed."
