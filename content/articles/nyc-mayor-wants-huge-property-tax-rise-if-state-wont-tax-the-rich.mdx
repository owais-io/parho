summary: "NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani has offered two ways to fill the city’s $7bn budget gap. The first is to raise income and corporate taxes on the city’s richest residents and businesses, which would need the governor’s approval. The second is a 9.5% property tax increase that would affect millions of homes and over 100,000 commercial buildings. The proposal has sparked backlash from city lawmakers, who say the hike would hurt working‑class New Yorkers."
