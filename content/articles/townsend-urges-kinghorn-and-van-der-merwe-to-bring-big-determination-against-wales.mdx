title: "Townsend urges Kinghorn and Van der Merwe to bring big determination against Wales"
summary: "Scottish coach Gregor Townsend wants Blair Kinghorn and Duhan Van der Merwe to bring “huge determination” when Scotland face Wales. The two were left out of the first two Six Nations games but return to start in Cardiff. Townsend has also shuffled the rest of the squad, giving fresh players a chance. Wales are also changing up their line‑up, with new wing Gabe Hamer‑Webb making his debut. Both teams look for a big win to boost their campaigns."
