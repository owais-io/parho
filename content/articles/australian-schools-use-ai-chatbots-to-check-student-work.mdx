title: "Australian Schools Use AI Chatbots to Check Student Work"
summary: "Australian schools are now using AI chatbots to quiz students about their essays, helping teachers spot plagiarism and check understanding. In Adelaide Hills, the bot asks follow‑up questions, while students also use drones, sensors and Meta AI glasses to explore nature. But AI adoption varies across the country, with only NSW and South Australia having full programs. Education groups warn that unequal rollout could widen gaps, urging the federal government to launch a national pilot and provide training."
