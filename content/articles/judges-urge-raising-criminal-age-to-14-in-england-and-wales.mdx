title: "Judges Urge Raising Criminal Age to 14 in England and Wales"
summary: "Two senior judges, Lady Hale and Lady Butler‑Sloss, have signed an amendment to the crime bill, asking the government to raise the age at which a child can be charged as an adult from 10 to 14. They say kids’ brains aren’t fully developed by 10, so they shouldn’t face adult courts or a permanent criminal record. The government plans to fight the change, but the move could bring England and Wales in line with most other European countries."
