title: "Unions ask Reeves to boost living standards while business pushes for employment‑rights changes"
summary: "Unions are calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to create a budget that raises living standards by raising the minimum wage, cutting energy bills, and ending the two‑child benefit cap. They say workers have seen almost no real pay growth since 2010. At the same time, business leaders, led by the CBI, want the chancellor to cut welfare costs and rethink an employment‑rights bill that many firms say will make hiring harder. Both sides agree energy costs are a big problem."
