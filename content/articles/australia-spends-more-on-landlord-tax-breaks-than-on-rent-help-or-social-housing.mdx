title: "Australia spends more on landlord tax breaks than on rent help or social housing"
summary: "Australia gives more money to landlord tax breaks than it does to help with rent or build social homes. Researchers say the government spent $12.3 bn on landlord tax breaks last year, while only $9.6 bn went to rent assistance and social housing. The share of homes meant for low‑income families is down to just 3.6%. Rising rents, long waiting lists and growing homelessness mean the country needs a new housing plan."
