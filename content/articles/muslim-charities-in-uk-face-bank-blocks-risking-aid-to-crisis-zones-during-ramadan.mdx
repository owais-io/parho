title: "Muslim charities in UK face bank blocks, risking aid to crisis zones during Ramadan"
summary: "UK Muslim charities are struggling to keep bank accounts because of strict “de‑risking” rules. Over two‑thirds can’t open new accounts, and 42% had services shut. This means money raised in Ramadan – when Muslims give a lot – can’t reach places like Sudan, Syria, and Palestine on time. Banks worry about money‑laundering and terrorism rules, but the result is delayed help and lost trust from donors and mosques. Advocates call for law that makes bank accounts a right for charities."
