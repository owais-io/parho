title: "Leaked Liberal Immigration Plan Bans Migrants, Court Case, and Pet Grief Advice"
summary: "The Liberal Party’s new immigration policy, now leaked, would bar people from 13 countries—including Gaza, Afghanistan and Somalia—from entering Australia because those areas are said to be controlled by terrorist groups. The plan was made before former leader Sussan Ley was removed, and the new opposition leader hasn’t seen it. Meanwhile, Naveed Akram, accused in the Bondi beach terror attack, appears in court, and a psychologist offers tips on coping after losing a pet."
