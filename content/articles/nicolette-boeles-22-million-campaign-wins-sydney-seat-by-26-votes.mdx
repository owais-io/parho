title: "Nicolette Boele’s $2.2 million campaign wins Sydney seat by 26 votes"
summary: "Nicolette Boele won the Sydney seat of Bradfield by just 26 votes, spending $2.26 million – the most for any teal independent. She outspent rivals like Allegra Spender and Monique Ryan and received over $696,000 from Climate 200, a major backer of community candidates. The 2025 election saw record political donations. New rules will lower donation limits and cap spending, which Boele says hurts independents."
