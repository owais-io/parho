title: "UK Bans Profitable Ticket Resale to Protect Fans"
summary: "After years of campaigning, the UK government has banned buying and selling concert and sports tickets above their face value. The move stops “touts” and bots that snatch tickets and sell them at huge mark‑ups, costing fans up to six times the price. The law will hit sites like Viagogo and StubHub, which could lose most of their business. Supporters say fans will pay fair prices, but some worry the ban could create new black‑market risks."
