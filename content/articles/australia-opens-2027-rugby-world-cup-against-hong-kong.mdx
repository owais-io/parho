title: "Australia opens 2027 Rugby World Cup against Hong Kong"
summary: "Australia will start the 2027 Rugby World Cup by playing Hong Kong, its first team ever at a World Cup. The match is on 1 Oct in Perth, chosen because organizers wanted a quieter opener instead of a high‑profile game with New Zealand. The tournament has 24 teams and will feature a “Super Sunday” with five games on 17 Oct. Tickets go on sale 18 Feb, and the schedule aims to keep fans busy over weekends."
