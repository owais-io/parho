title: "UK energy suppliers missing capital targets, regulator must act"
summary: "After last year’s gas crisis, Ofgem set rules requiring energy companies to hold enough money to stay afloat. A new report finds five of 23 suppliers now fall below these targets, up from three last year. Ofgem says it will help them but gives no clear deadlines or names, and it won’t ban them from taking new customers. The vague approach has raised worries about consumer protection and regulator strength."
