title: "Trump Says He’ll Take Away TV Network Licences"
summary: "Trump has threatened to take away FCC licences for national TV networks like ABC, NBC and CBS several times, saying they spread “fake news”. He has made more than 28 such statements since 2017, but the FCC only licences local stations, not the big networks, so the threat has little real power. FCC chair Anna Gomez said the threat is basically empty, and no licences are due for renewal soon."
