title: "Inside the Heatwave: How Many Americans Are Dying From Extreme Heat"
summary: "I travelled to Arizona to investigate heat‑related deaths during a brutal summer. Over 50 people died in Phoenix and the surrounding area, many inside their homes or mobile homes. Poor and low‑income residents are most at risk, and the U.S. has no reliable system to count these deaths. The piece also links the rising heat to Trump’s rollback of green‑energy support, especially in Appalachia, worsening already‑vulnerable communities."
