title: "Federal plan for biodiversity offsets could repeat NSW’s failures, critics warn"
summary: "Australia’s Labor government wants to change how developers pay for environmental damage, but scientists and lawyers warn the new plan could repeat the mistakes that ruined New South Wales’s offset system. The proposal would let developers put money into a federal fund instead of doing on‑ground restoration, relax the requirement that new habitat match the one lost, and even let the government top up shortfalls. Past NSW failures show the system often falls short, harming endangered species."
