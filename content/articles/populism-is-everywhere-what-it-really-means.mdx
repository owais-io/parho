title: "Populism Is Everywhere – What It Really Means"
summary: "Oliver Eagleton explains that the word “populism” has lost its clear meaning and now simply refers to leaders who split society into “us” and “them” and use a strong‑man image to control the state. He points out that populists often rely on flashy self‑promotion, corruption, ties to authoritarian regimes, secret funding, and racist rhetoric. The letter urges readers to rethink political labels and clarify what left and right really mean."
