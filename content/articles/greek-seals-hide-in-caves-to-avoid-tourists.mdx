title: "Greek Seals Hide in Caves to Avoid Tourists"
summary: "In Greece’s marine parks, the rare Mediterranean monk seal—about 500 in the country—is protected, but growing tourism is disturbing them. Seal researchers see more animals on open beaches, a sign of protection, yet unregulated boats and yachts still crowd key spots like the island of Formicula. New marine protected areas and education campaigns aim to help, but lack of patrols and enforcement means the seals still face danger from human activity."
