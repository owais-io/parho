title: "Higher education means less support for right‑wing parties in the UK"
summary: "A new study shows that people in the UK with university degrees are much less likely to back right‑wing parties like the Conservatives or Reform UK than those with only A‑level or lower qualifications. Education also strongly shapes views on diversity and immigration. The same trend appears in the US, but other factors such as ethnicity and gender also matter there."
