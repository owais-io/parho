title: "UK Refugee Resettlement Drops 26% This Year"
summary: "In the year ending September 2025, the UK accepted 7,271 refugees through UN‑run resettlement schemes, down 26% from 9,872 a year earlier. Most of the new arrivals were Afghans whose details were mistakenly sent to Afghanistan by a defence office, putting them at risk. The government suspended the family‑reunion route, pushing refugees toward risky small‑boat crossings. Officials say three new “safe” paths will open, but the scale and pace are unclear."
