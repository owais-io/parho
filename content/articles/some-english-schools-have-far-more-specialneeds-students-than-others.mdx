title: "Some English schools have far more special‑needs students than others"
summary: "A new study shows that in England some primary schools have up to six times more pupils with special‑needs plans than the least‑affected schools. Many schools are reluctant to accept children with these plans because they fear it could hurt exam results and attract stricter inspections. This uneven spread is putting extra pressure on schools that already have lots of special‑needs pupils, especially those in poorer areas. The government is preparing new rules to help schools share the load and keep every child in a suitable setting."
