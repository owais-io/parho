title: "Protest groups challenge NSW law that could halt Invasion Day marches"
summary: "Protest groups in Sydney have filed a court case against new NSW laws that could stop marches, including Invasion Day rallies. A judge said the case will wait until January 29, so the upcoming marches on 16, 18, and 26 January may go ahead without clear protection. Police have kept a safety ban in place until Jan 20, citing the Bondi attack. The groups say the laws curb free speech; the government says they keep peace."
