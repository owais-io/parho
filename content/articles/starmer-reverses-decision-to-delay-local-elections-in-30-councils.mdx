title: "Starmer Reverses Decision to Delay Local Elections in 30 Councils"
summary: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has reversed a last‑minute plan to postpone local elections in 30 English councils. The change came after a legal warning that the move would likely be lost in court, and because MPs were furious. Councils now must organise May 2026 elections on short notice, and the government will spend £63 million to cover extra costs. The move has angered Labour MPs and cost the government a £100,000 legal bill."
