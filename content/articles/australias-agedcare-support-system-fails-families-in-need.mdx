title: "Australia’s aged‑care support system fails families in need"
summary: "Families who get government‑funded care for dying relatives find the support system confusing and slow. A new algorithm‑based assessment and a package called Support at Home let carers choose private providers, but approvals for essential items like beds, wheelchairs and oxygen can be delayed for months. Many parents run out of money, lose control over how funds are spent, and end up fighting for invoices or basic care."
