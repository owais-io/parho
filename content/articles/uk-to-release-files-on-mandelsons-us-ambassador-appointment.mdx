title: "UK to Release Files on Mandelson’s US Ambassador Appointment"
summary: "UK MPs have forced the government to release files on how former Labour minister Peter Mandelson was chosen as Britain’s ambassador to Washington. A humble address motion, led by Kemi Badenoch, won in the House of Commons and is set to produce a big dump of paperwork, except for any that hurt national security. The move follows Starmer’s own use of the tactic and shows a push for more openness in government."
