title: "Labour’s animal‑welfare plan needs stronger action"
summary: "The Labour government’s new animal‑welfare plan will ban hen cages and pig crates and aims to help farmed animals, but critics say it still leaves wildlife badly protected and doesn’t curb factory farming. The strategy only tweaks rules like a hare‑hunting season, while many native species get little legal support. Some letters argue that banning electric collars for cats would hurt their safety. Overall, readers call for stronger action on wildlife and a move away from intensive farming."
