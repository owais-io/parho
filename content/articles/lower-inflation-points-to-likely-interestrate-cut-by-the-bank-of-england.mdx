title: "Lower inflation points to likely interest‑rate cut by the Bank of England"
summary: "The UK’s inflation dropped to 3.2% in November, the lowest in months, giving the Bank of England a strong reason to lower borrowing costs. The policy meeting on Thursday is expected to see a 0.25‑point cut, which could help the economy as tax hikes and a slowing job market weigh on households. Politician Rachel Reeves hopes the rate cut will give the country a needed boost."
