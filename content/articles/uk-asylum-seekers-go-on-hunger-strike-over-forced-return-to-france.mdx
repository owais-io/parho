title: "UK asylum seekers go on hunger strike over forced return to France"
summary: "Thirty people held in a UK detention centre have begun a hunger strike because they are about to be sent back to France under a Home Office plan that swaps one asylum seeker in for one out. The scheme aims to stop small boat crossings, but many people sent to France later return on boats. The strikers say they’re treated like criminals and denied information or legal help, and they want the chance to claim asylum in the UK."
