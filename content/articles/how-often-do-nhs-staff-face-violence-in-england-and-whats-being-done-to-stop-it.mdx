title: "How often do NHS staff face violence in England, and what’s being done to stop it?"
summary: "A Guardian investigation found almost 300,000 reports of physical violence and aggression against NHS staff in England from 2022‑2025. About one in seven workers said they were attacked, meaning more than 200,000 people faced violence in 2024 alone, and the real number could be over a million a year. Mental‑health trusts see the most incidents. Sexual abuse claims rose to nearly 50,000. The NHS has new safety rules, but unions say more must be done."
