title: "Warmest spring in Britain boosts songbird breeding"
summary: "Britain's record‑warm, sunny spring in 2025 helped many songbirds raise more young. Scientists and volunteer bird ringers saw higher breeding success for 14 species, including robins, tits, and warblers. The dry weather meant birds had more food and could produce a second brood. But overall adult numbers of some popular species still fell, showing long‑term challenges from farming and climate change."
