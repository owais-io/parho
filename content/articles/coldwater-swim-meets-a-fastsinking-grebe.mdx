title: "Cold‑water swim meets a fast‑sinking grebe"
summary: "I tried cold‑water swimming to help with pain and ended up sharing a lake with a tiny grebe. The 6 °C water was nerve‑racking, but spotting a dabchick—a quick‑diving bird—made me feel less alone. The grebe dove safely thanks to its waterproof feathers, and I followed it across the lake. Watching the birds enjoy the water made my swim feel worthwhile."
