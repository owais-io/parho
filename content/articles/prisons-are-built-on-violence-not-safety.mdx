title: "Prisons Are Built on Violence, Not Safety"
summary: "Prisons don’t just let inmates fight – their rules and conditions create violence. The article cites the inquest into Sundeep Ghuman, where prison missteps and overcrowding led to his death. It points out that many inmates die from suicide, neglect or drugs, and that daily restraints and poor conditions keep people dehumanised. There’s been no rise in prison killings, yet prisons still harm people. The author calls for ending new prisons, cutting the prison roll, and funding community help instead."
