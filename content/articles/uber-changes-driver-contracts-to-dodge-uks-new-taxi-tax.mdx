title: "Uber changes driver contracts to dodge UK’s new taxi tax"
summary: "Uber updated its driver contracts from January 2026 so drivers will deal with passengers and add VAT to their fares. Because most drivers earn under £90,000 a year, they don’t have to charge VAT, so Uber’s fares outside London avoid the new 20% “taxi tax”. In London the rules stay the same, so passengers still pay VAT. The change was made to dodge the government’s new tax, expected to raise about £700 million a year for the Treasury."
