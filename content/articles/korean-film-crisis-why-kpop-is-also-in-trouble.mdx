summary: "South Korea’s music and movies once made the world famous, but inside the country the industries are struggling.

K‑pop albums are also selling less, and record companies are betting more on concerts and a small, dedicated fan base. While foreign shows use Korean style, critics worry the country’s creativity and local businesses may fade."
