title: "U.S. Monuments Strip Slavery Stories Under Trump Order"
summary: "In January, workers at Philadelphia’s President’s House removed 34 panels that told how George Washington’s enslaved people lived. The move follows a 2025 Trump executive order that tells the National Park Service to delete or change any displays seen as “disparaging.” Critics say this erases important history, and the city sued. A judge has stopped further changes until the case is decided."
