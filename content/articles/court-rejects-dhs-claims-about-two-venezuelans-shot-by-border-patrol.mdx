summary: "A federal court found that the Department of Homeland Security’s claims that two Venezuelan immigrants shot by U.S. border patrol agents in Oregon were gang members were false. Court documents show no evidence of gang ties or criminal history, and the FBI affidavit contradicts DHS’s statements.
