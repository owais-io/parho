title: "Labour should buy homes from landlords to boost social housing"
summary: "The letter, written by Siân Berry MP, says the government should give money to local councils so they can buy existing homes—especially former council houses and other suitable houses—rather than waiting to build new ones. Buying ready houses would give more family homes quickly, help children who are still in temporary accommodation, and curb rising rents. The author says this would help landlords too, by turning their cash‑cow homes into needed social homes."
