title: "UK retailers are putting more money into physical stores"
summary: "UK retailers are finally returning to brick‑and‑mortar shops.  Shopping centres and food outlets are leading the comeback, as online sales have slowed to about 26‑28% of all retail sales—down from a pandemic peak of 35%.  Property investors are earning about 9.2% on retail, the best return of any commercial type, and shopping centres and food stores each give 10.2% growth.  Big firms are buying more retail sites and selling offices, driving demand above supply and lowering store vacancy to its lowest level since 2020."
