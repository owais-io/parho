title: "NSW Health Says No to Lowering Lead Test Threshold for Broken Hill Kids"
summary: "NSW Health has said it will not lower the blood‑lead test limit for children in Broken Hill. The state government had asked the threshold to drop from 5 to 3.5 micrograms per decilitre so more kids could get help. Documents show most children, especially Aboriginal kids, exceed 3.5, yet health officials say they lack the capacity and worry about privacy. The Greens MP calls the move a disgrace and says more money is needed."
