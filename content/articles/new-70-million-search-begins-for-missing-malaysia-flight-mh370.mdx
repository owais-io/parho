title: "New $70 million Search Begins for Missing Malaysia Flight MH370"
summary: "More than a decade after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished, the search is back on. Ocean Infinity will use a $70 million contract, paying only if they find the wreck. They’ll scour a 15,000‑sq‑km area in the Indian Ocean with high‑tech underwater robots that map the sea floor, detect metal, and can bring up pieces. The job is tough – rough seas, deep trenches and a huge search zone – but the team is determined."
