title: "UK drug‑price deal was crucial, but GSK says US market still dominates"
summary: "The UK government recently raised the price the NHS pays for new drugs. GSK chief Emma Walmsley said the US still offers the biggest market, so GSK spends more there than in the UK. The new deal gives the UK three years of zero tariffs on US exports, caps drug rebates at 15%, and raises the NHS’s price limits. It will add about £3 billion a year to NHS spending, helping keep British researchers and patients on top of new treatments."
