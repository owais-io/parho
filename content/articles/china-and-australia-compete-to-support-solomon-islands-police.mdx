summary: "In the Solomon Islands, Chinese police bring training and community projects—solar lights, sewing machines, and soccer balls—to local leaders. Australia sends advisers, trucks, and patrol boats to strengthen the police force. Both give money and training, but China focuses on community outreach, while Australia concentrates on police equipment. Local leaders enjoy China’s hands‑on help, but some prefer Australia’s formal support. The rivalry shows how the two countries are vying for influence in this Pacific nation."
