title: "Paul McCartney Urges EU to Drop Ban on Veggie Burgers and Sausages"
summary: "The former Beatle has joined a group of British MPs in writing to the EU to reject a rule that would stop using words like “burger” and “sausage” on plant‑based foods. They say the ban is unnecessary and would hurt climate progress. The EU has already voted to enforce it, but critics argue it hurts farmers and could affect the UK market. McCartney stresses clear labels should be enough."
