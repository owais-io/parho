title: "UK Uses More Wood for Power Than Ever, Drax Data Shows"
summary: "Britain’s biggest wood‑burning plant, Drax, supplied a record 9 % of the country’s electricity in July, and at one point in September it supplied almost a fifth. The government is cutting the subsidies that let Drax run so often, limiting support to about a quarter of the time. Critics say the wood isn’t as “sustainable” as the company claims, and experts say the country should move to wind and solar instead."
