title: "Google AI recipes are hurting food bloggers' earnings"
summary: "When Google started showing AI‑generated recipes, it pulled bits from many bloggers, mixed them together, and sometimes even suggested odd things like glue. Because recipes aren’t protected by copyright, writers can’t sue. Many food bloggers say their traffic and ad money have dropped because people trust the AI recipes instead of the real blogs. Some are trying paywalls or cookbooks, but the problem keeps growing."
