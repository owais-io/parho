title: "UK House Prices Jump in New Year"
summary: "The average price of a UK home listed on the market rose by almost £10,000 in January, the biggest monthly jump in 25 years. Rightmove says the rise comes after people relaxed about a budget that could have added a tax on expensive homes, and because the Bank of England cut rates before Christmas. After the holidays, buyer interest surged 57% and new listings jumped 81%. First‑time buyers still find prices high, and rents fell a bit."
