title: "Labour Should Let Andy Burnham Run in Gorton Byelection"
summary: "Labour’s National Executive Committee blocked Andy Burnham from standing in the Gorton and Denton byelection. The author argues this move limits healthy debate inside the party and hurts the party’s chances. Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, has shown that a local‑first approach can drive growth and attract voters. Letting him run would bring fresh ideas, energise members, and show Labour is open to contestation. It could help the party win the seat and shift the national mood."
