title: "French farmers protest in Paris over EU‑Mercosur trade deal"
summary: "French farmers drove tractors into the streets near the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe to protest an EU‑Mercosur trade deal that could flood Europe with cheaper imports and hurt their income. They also marched to parliament, heckling officials. The EU will vote on the agreement next Friday; France opposes it but cannot block it alone. Italy and other states may approve, while the EU offered €45 bn in aid to farmers to ease concerns."
