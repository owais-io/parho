title: "Tyre Chemical Linked to Salmon Deaths"
summary: "Fishers in California are suing tyre makers in a San Francisco court, saying a chemical added to car tyres leaches into rivers and kills coho salmon. Scientists say the breakdown product 6PPD‑quinone is the culprit, after fish deaths spiked after rain. The case will decide if tyre companies break the Endangered Species Act. Tyre experts argue the chemical never reaches fish waters and degrades quickly."
