title: "15 English sewage plants still use the plastic beads that spilled at Camber Sands"
summary: "At least 15 sewage plants on England’s south coast still use the same plastic beads that spilled at Camber Sands last month. The beads help clean water but can break loose and become micro‑plastics, harming fish, birds and humans. Experts want the plants upgraded or the beads removed. Local groups and MPs are demanding faster action, while some water companies say they’ll replace the beads when the sites are rebuilt."
