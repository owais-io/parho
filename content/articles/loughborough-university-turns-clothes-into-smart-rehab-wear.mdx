title: "Loughborough University Turns Clothes Into Smart Rehab Wear"
summary: "Researchers at Loughborough University are turning everyday clothes into smart medical tools. Dr Ishara Dharmasena blends textiles with nanotechnology to create wearable bandages, shirts and pants that generate power from movement, track heart rate and muscle activity, and send data to doctors. This lets patients recover at home and frees up busy rehab clinics. The university also partners with experts who study brain‑muscle signals and grow lab‑made muscle tissue, pushing rehabilitation into a new, tech‑driven era."
