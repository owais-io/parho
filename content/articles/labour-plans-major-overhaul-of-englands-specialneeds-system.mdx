title: "Labour plans major overhaul of England’s special‑needs system"
summary: "Labour will change England’s special‑needs system because it has become too expensive and hard for parents and schools to manage. The number of children with EHCPs – the paperwork that guarantees extra help – has jumped 80% in five years, while spending is up 50% and councils are almost bankrupt. New plans aim to give more support inside regular schools, cut the need for EHCPs, and stop pricey private special‑school use."
