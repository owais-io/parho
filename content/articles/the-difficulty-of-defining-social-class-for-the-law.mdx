title: "The Difficulty of Defining Social Class for the Law"
summary: "The letter shows how hard it is to pin down what “working‑class” really means in law. The writer says she is working class but offers no clear criteria, pointing out that class can involve accent, postcode, income, job, and even grandparents’ work. The piece also argues that comprehensive schools—not selective grammar schools—gave poorer kids better chances. It questions any single legal definition of class."
