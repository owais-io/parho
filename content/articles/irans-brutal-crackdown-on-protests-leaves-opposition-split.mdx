title: "Iran's brutal crackdown on protests leaves opposition split"
summary: "The Iranian government used extreme violence to stop protests, killing many people. State TV portrays demonstrators as drug addicts or foreign agents, but most Iranians remember the killings. Inside the country the opposition is torn—some still hope the former king’s son, Reza Pahlavi, can help, while others say he has no real plan or support. Without a clear strategy, the movement stays weak and divided."
