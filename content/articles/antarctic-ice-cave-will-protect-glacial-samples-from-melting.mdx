title: "Antarctic Ice Cave Will Protect Glacial Samples From Melting"
summary: "Last month, the Ice Memory Foundation opened the world’s first ice‑cave museum in Antarctica. The cave sits deep in the cold plateau, where temperatures stay around –50 °C. Scientists bury long ice cores—tubes of glacier ice—from melting glaciers. The cores hold tiny air bubbles and pollen that reveal past climates and plant life. Storing them in the ice keeps them safe for centuries while the world’s glaciers shrink."
