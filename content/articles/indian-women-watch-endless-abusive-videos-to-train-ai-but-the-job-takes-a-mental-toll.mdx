title: "Indian women watch endless abusive videos to train AI, but the job takes a mental toll"
summary: "An Indian woman named Monsumi Murmu, and many others, work from home to label images and videos flagged by tech companies. They sift through up to 800 disturbing clips a day, including violence and child abuse, to teach AI what is harmful. The constant exposure leaves them numb, anxious, and with sleepless nights. Many get no mental‑health help, and laws don’t protect them. NDAs keep workers silent, deepening isolation."
