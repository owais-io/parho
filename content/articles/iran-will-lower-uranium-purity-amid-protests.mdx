title: "Iran Will Lower Uranium Purity Amid Protests"
summary: "Iran says it won’t ship its 300 kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium but will dilute it from 60 % to 20 % under UN inspectors. The offer could decide whether U.S. President Trump will use naval forces against Tehran. Meanwhile, students at Mashhad and Tehran universities staged protests, chanting anti‑government slogans. Iran’s foreign minister insists the U.S. has not demanded a halt to enrichment, and Iran is also sending a new member to the UN Human Rights Council."
