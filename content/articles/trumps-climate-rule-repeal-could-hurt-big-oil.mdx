title: "Trump’s Climate Rule Repeal Could Hurt Big Oil"
summary: "Trump’s EPA has rolled back a 2009 climate rule that said greenhouse gases endanger public health. That move lifts federal limits on car emissions and could let oil companies fight state lawsuits more easily, but critics warn it also weakens the rule that helped stop oil firms from being sued for climate damage. A Supreme Court case could decide if the repeal opens the door for more climate lawsuits."
