title: "Government’s weak response to appointment‑reform report hurts public trust"
summary: "A 2023 report called “No Favourites” accused Australian governments of stuffing political friends into senior public roles, eroding trust and fairness. The report was kept secret for two years, then finally released after pressure. It suggested clear rules—set terms, vet candidates, stop appointments near elections—and urged the law be changed to enforce them. The new framework announced by the finance minister only adopted a few ideas, ignored the call for legal backing, and left many safeguards out, leaving many people disappointed."
