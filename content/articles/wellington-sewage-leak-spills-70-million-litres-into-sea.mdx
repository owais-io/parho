title: "Wellington Sewage Leak Spills 70 Million Litres into Sea"
summary: "A huge sewage leak in Wellington’s wastewater plant has dumped about 70 million litres of raw sewage into the sea, causing authorities to warn people against swimming, collecting seafood or walking dogs on nearby beaches. Heavy rain pushed untreated waste into a short outfall pipe, bypassing the main treatment system. City officials are working to fix the broken pipe and reduce the amount of raw water released, but the spill is still a health and environmental risk."
