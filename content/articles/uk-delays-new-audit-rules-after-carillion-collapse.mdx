title: "UK delays new audit rules after Carillion collapse"
summary: "After Carillion collapsed in 2018, the UK government promised major audit reforms to stop future corporate failures. But the new bill never got drafted, and ministers now say the changes would raise costs for businesses. The audit watchdog, the FRC, still lacks statutory powers and secure funding, meaning it can’t enforce stricter rules or punish directors easily. The government’s weak commitment has left the industry’s regulatory framework unchanged."
