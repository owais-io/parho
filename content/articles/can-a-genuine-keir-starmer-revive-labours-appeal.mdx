title: "Can a Genuine Keir Starmer Revive Labour’s Appeal?"
summary: "Keir Starmer has been under pressure after a series of controversies and key staff departures. He publicly rebuked a Manchester United owner’s offensive immigration comments and has tried to show a stronger, more authentic voice. Inside Labour, there’s debate over how to tackle immigration, how to win back working‑class voters, and whether Starmer should fight hard against the far‑right. The upcoming Gorton and Denton by‑election will test whether a fresher, bolder approach can win over voters."
