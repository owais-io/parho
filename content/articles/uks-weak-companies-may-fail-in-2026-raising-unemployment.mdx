title: "UK’s Weak Companies May Fail in 2026, Raising Unemployment"
summary: "A think‑tank says that in 2026 many weak UK companies could go out of business because higher interest rates, energy bills and the minimum wage are squeezing them. That could push the unemployment rate up in the short term, but it might also clear the way for newer, more productive businesses to grow. Firms are already feeling the pinch from tax hikes and higher costs, so hiring is slow."
