title: "Labour’s Promise to Cut Violence Against Women Is Still Unfinished"
summary: "Labour pledged to halve violence against women and girls in ten years, but the plan is still stuck. Sexual assaults have stayed the same and image‑related crimes are climbing. The government’s limited budget and the fact that many departments are involved have slowed progress. New ideas include teaching healthy relationships in schools, a summit for men and boys, and a national inquiry into grooming gangs. However, court backlogs and lack of money mean victims still wait long for justice."
