title: "New Computer Model Could Guide Climate‑Friendly Economics"
summary: "Economist Doyne Farmer says a new computer model that tracks every energy company could give governments better climate plans. The model uses simple rules, learns from real data, and can run millions of actors instead of a few. He says the $100m project would show how to shift to green power and avoid financial crashes. With better forecasts, policy makers could save trillions and prevent 2008‑style crises."
