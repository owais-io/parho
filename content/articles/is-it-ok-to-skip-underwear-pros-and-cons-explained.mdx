title: "Is it OK to skip underwear? Pros and cons explained"
summary: "A 2023 YouGov poll shows 7% of Americans always go commando and another 10% often skip underwear. Doctors say comfort matters most, but the fabric and fit can affect health. Cotton is breathable, while polyester can trap heat and raise the risk of yeast or jock itch. Tight underwear may slightly lower sperm count in men, but the effect is small. Going commando is generally safe, though underwear is useful for exercise, sports, and after a shower."
