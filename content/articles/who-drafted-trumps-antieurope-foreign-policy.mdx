title: "Who Drafted Trump’s Anti‑Europe Foreign Policy?"
summary: "Michael Anton, a former State Department aide, wrote a new U.S. National Security Strategy that says immigration threatens Western culture and pushes the U.S. to work with less‑democratic European allies. The draft shocked European leaders and has led U.S. embassies to collect data on immigrant‑related crimes. Trump didn’t write it and may not have read it, but his advisers pushed it forward. The strategy shows a shift toward a tougher, more nationalist U.S. foreign policy."
