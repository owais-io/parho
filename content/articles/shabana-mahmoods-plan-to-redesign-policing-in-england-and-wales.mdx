title: "Shabana Mahmood’s Plan to Redesign Policing in England and Wales"
summary: "Shabana Mahmood, the Home Secretary, has published a white paper that could cut the number of police forces in England and Wales from 43 to fewer by 2034, merge them, and create a new national police service. The plan would also introduce licensing for officers, expand facial‑recognition vans, and scrap police commissioners. While aimed at saving money and boosting national crime‑fighting power, the proposals face opposition from rural MPs, police leaders and concerns about civil‑rights impacts."
