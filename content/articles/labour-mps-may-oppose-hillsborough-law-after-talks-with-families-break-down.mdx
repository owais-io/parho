title: "Labour MPs may oppose Hillsborough law after talks with families break down"
summary: "Labour’s new Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants a law that forces public officials and contractors to be honest after disasters. Families of Hillsborough and Manchester Arena victims say the bill still lets intelligence chiefs block evidence from their own officers, which could let cover‑ups happen again. Because of that, 20 Labour MPs may rebel against the law. The bill has been delayed for another week while talks continue."
