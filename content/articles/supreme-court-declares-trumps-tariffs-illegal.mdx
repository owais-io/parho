title: "Supreme Court Declares Trump’s Tariffs Illegal"
summary: "On Friday the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that President Trump’s tariffs are unlawful because the power to impose tariffs belongs to Congress, not the president. The decision, which rejected Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, limits his ability to unilaterally hit countries with trade barriers. Trump angrily blasted the justices on social media, but the ruling shows the court can check executive overreach and may impact other Trump actions."
