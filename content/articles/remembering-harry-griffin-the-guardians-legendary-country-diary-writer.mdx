title: "Remembering Harry Griffin, the Guardian’s Legendary Country Diary Writer"
summary: "Harry Griffin was a legendary Guardian writer who spent 53 years (1951‑2004) sending readers a short, vivid snapshot of the Lake District every other Monday. He began after the previous diarist died and kept a tight 300‑word limit, covering everything from sheep to climbing, tourism and even cold‑water swimming. A lifelong mountain lover, former reporter and wartime officer, he brought humour and depth to the fells. He died in 2004, his final entry about Black Combe."
