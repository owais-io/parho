The regime has warned anyone who protests is an enemy of God and has blamed the U.S. and Israel for stirring trouble. The U.S. and Europe have backed the demonstrators, while human‑rights groups report forced confessions and hospital injuries. Iran says it will fight those it calls “foreign‑backed rioters.”
