title: "Did the NCAA’s 40‑Year‑Old Test Rule Help or Hurt Black College Athletes?"
summary: "Proposition 48, a rule the NCAA made in 1986, tied a freshman’s chance to play sports to test scores and grades. It barred many black athletes, who made up most of those cut. Over time the rule changed, and schools added tutoring. Graduation rates for athletes rose, but experts say other programs also helped. Tony Rice, one of those cut, used the extra year to study and later earned a degree and a national title."
