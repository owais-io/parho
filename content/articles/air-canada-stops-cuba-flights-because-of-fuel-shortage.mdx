title: "Air Canada Stops Cuba Flights Because of Fuel Shortage"
summary: "Air Canada has stopped all flights to Cuba because the island can’t get enough aviation fuel after the U.S. oil blockade. The airline is sending 3,000 passengers back to Canada. The move hurts Cuba’s tourism money – a big part of its foreign‑currency earnings – and other airlines are facing the same problem. Mexico is sending aid, but flights still need special refueling stops, and Cuban tourism revenue could drop below $1 billion."
