title: "UKIP Logo Looks Like Nazi Cross, Authorities Weigh Approval"
summary: "UKIP wants to use a new logo that looks like the German iron cross used by the Nazis. The Electoral Commission will decide if it can be registered. The old logo was rejected for being offensive. The new design removes the sword but still shows the cross with the words “UKIP – The New Right.” Critics say it normalises far‑right symbols, and the public can submit comments before a final decision."
