title: "UK Cuts Funding to UN Food Programme, Critics Call It Hypocrisy"
summary: "Keir Starmer’s government has slashed the UK’s contribution to the UN World Food Programme by about a third, dropping from £448 m in 2024 to £322 m last year. The cuts come after Starmer promised to fight hunger, but the budget now falls to 0.3 % of GDP, with more money earmarked for defence. Human‑rights groups say the move is hypocritical and could cost lives, especially as the UK still spends on asylum‑seeker housing."
