title: "Court Lets Fertility Patients Keep Stored Embryos After Consent Slip‑up"
summary: "A London judge decided that over a dozen fertility patients could keep their embryos, eggs and sperm in storage even though their consent had expired. The ruling came after clinics failed to remind patients that they must renew written permission every 10 years. The decision means the patients—many of whom had cancer—won’t lose the chance to use their frozen material, and the move faced no opposition from clinics or regulators."
