summary: "Since the Trump era, ICE has run large deportation drives, sparking fear and family separation. Ordinary citizens are now organizing to counteract these raids. They use Signal chats, whistles, and rapid‑response teams to warn neighbors, block officers, and give emotional support. Other volunteers deliver groceries to scared families, set up safe “walking school buses,” watch court hearings, and fund detainees’ commissary accounts. Together, they’re building solidarity and hope, determined to outlast aggressive enforcement."
