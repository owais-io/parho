title: "Archaeologists Find Ancient Luxury Boat off Alexandria Coast"
summary: "Archaeologists have uncovered a 35‑metre pleasure boat near Alexandria, Egypt. The ship matches an early‑century description by Greek writer Strabo and is the first example of a vessel he mentioned. Built with a grand central cabin and wide beam, it probably needed over 20 rowers. The wreck sits close to a temple, suggesting it may have sunk during the temple’s destruction around AD 50. The find promises new clues about life and worship on Egypt’s waterways."
