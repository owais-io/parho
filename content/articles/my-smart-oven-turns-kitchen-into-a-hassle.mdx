title: "My Smart Oven Turns Kitchen Into a Hassle"
summary: "I bought a new smart oven that has no knob and only a touchscreen. The menu forces me to pick weird heating modes like “hot air” and gives only a handful of temperatures. It keeps demanding a Wi‑Fi connection and nags about updates. I’m stuck with confusing options and constant alerts, turning what should be a simple kitchen appliance into a hassle‑filled headache."
