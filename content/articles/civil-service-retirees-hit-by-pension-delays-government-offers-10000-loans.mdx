title: "Civil Service retirees hit by pension delays, government offers £10,000 loans"
summary: "Many civil servants who retired last year are struggling because their pensions are delayed. Without money, they can't pay food, heating, rent. The government says it’s a “completely unacceptable” mistake and will give interest‑free hardship loans of up to £10,000 to those worst affected. The problem started when Capita took over the scheme, causing a huge backlog and customer service chaos."
