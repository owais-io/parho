summary: "People aren’t scared of an AI price bubble; they’re worried AI will steal jobs. Experts say AI could erase half of entry‑level white‑collar jobs and add millions of unemployed. The article argues that tech firms should build “pro‑worker” AI that boosts skills instead of cutting jobs. It calls for government action—training programs, universal health, better unemployment insurance, and higher taxes on the rich—to protect workers and give them a say in AI’s future."
