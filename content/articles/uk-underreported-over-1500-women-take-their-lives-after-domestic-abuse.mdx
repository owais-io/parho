title: "UK Under‑reported: Over 1,500 Women Take Their Lives After Domestic Abuse"
summary: "In the UK, experts say domestic‑abuse‑related suicides are far higher than police records show. They estimate up to 1,500 women could be taking their lives each year, many times the official count. Current investigations rarely treat these deaths as possible homicides, and few perpetrators get charged. Campaigners call for better policing, clearer laws, and mandatory criminal‑justice reviews. The lack of prosecutions leaves families feeling abandoned and the abuse cycle continues."
