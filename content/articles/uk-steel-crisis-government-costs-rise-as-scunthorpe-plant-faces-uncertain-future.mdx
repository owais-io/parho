summary: "British Steel has been losing money and the UK government is now spending over £1.2 million a day to keep the Scunthorpe plant running. The plant is owned by Chinese company Jingye, who wants a huge payout but will likely not get it. The government wants to replace coal‑powered blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces, which need a new buyer and could cut jobs. The future ownership and cost of the plant remain uncertain."
