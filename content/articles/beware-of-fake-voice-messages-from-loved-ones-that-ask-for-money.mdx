title: "Beware of Fake Voice Messages From Loved Ones That Ask for Money"
summary: "Criminals can use AI to copy a person’s voice from just a few seconds of real audio. They then create a fake voicemail that sounds like your child or friend, claiming an emergency and asking you to send money. If you get such a message, pause, verify with the person directly, and consider using a secret codeword. Stay calm and check before you act."
