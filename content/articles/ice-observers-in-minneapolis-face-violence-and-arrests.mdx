title: "ICE observers in Minneapolis face violence and arrests"
summary: "ICE officers in Minneapolis are harassing volunteers who watch immigration raids. They spray tear gas, break car windows, and handcuff observers, then send them to the Whipple federal building where they’re held for hours, denied water and phone calls. Even after two bystanders were shot dead, the observers keep filming. Lawyers say DHS blocks access to detainees. A lawsuit claims the agency is stopping confidential legal help. The incidents raise questions about the force used against witnesses."
