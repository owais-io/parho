title: "Can Syria’s new president turn worldwide support into real help for Syrians?"
summary: "Since taking office, Syrian President Ahmed al‑Sharaa has travelled to 13 countries, met UN leaders and even the U.S. president, hoping foreign goodwill will lift sanctions and bring investment. Saudi Arabia pledged $6 billion, Qatar is reviving oil, and the U.S. may lift sanctions before Christmas. But Syria still faces attacks from Israel, pressure from Turkey over Kurdish forces, and the need to rebuild trust inside the country. Whether the president can turn this support into gains for Syrians remains uncertain."
