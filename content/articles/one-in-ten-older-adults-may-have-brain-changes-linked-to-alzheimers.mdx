title: "One in Ten Older Adults May Have Brain Changes Linked to Alzheimer's"
summary: "Researchers found that about 10 % of people aged 70 or older in the UK have brain changes linked to Alzheimer’s. The study used a simple blood test and suggests that more than 1 million older adults could qualify for treatment, compared with only 70 000 the NHS thinks are eligible. It’s the first large‑scale survey and shows that these changes are common, especially after 70, and are not limited to women. Early detection could help target expensive therapies sooner."
