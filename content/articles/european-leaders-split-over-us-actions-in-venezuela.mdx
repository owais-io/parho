title: "European leaders split over US actions in Venezuela"
summary: "European leaders are divided after the US moved against Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro. Some support the US claim of “self‑defence” and call it a defensive intervention, while others, including the EU, warn that the move violates international law and could set a dangerous precedent. The EU stresses a peaceful, democratic transition, and many experts say the US action could undermine global rules that keep nations from using force too easily."
