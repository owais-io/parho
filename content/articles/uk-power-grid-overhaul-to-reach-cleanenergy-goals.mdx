title: "UK Power Grid Overhaul to Reach Clean‑Energy Goals"
summary: "UK electricity demand will rise 50% by 2035 as heating, industry and transport switch to electric. To keep up, the country must build 620 miles of new onshore lines and 2,800 miles of offshore network, and spend about £60 bn on upgrades. In 2024 renewables supplied 51% of power, with wind overtaking gas. The government aims for 95% carbon‑free electricity by 2030 and will need £40 bn per year in clean‑energy investment to support the growing EV and heat‑pump market."
