title: "Trump’s exit from climate treaties hurts only the U.S."
summary: "Trump’s decision to leave the UN climate treaty and the IPCC will barely change global climate action. It won’t stop the science or the worldwide shift to renewables, which now outspend fossil fuels by two‑to‑one. But U.S. businesses and households will face higher energy costs, insurance, and more climate damage. Other nations keep pushing for climate justice, while the U.S. risks falling behind economically and politically."
