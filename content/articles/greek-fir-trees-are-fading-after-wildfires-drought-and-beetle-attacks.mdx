title: "Greek Fir Trees Are Fading After Wildfires, Drought and Beetle Attacks"
summary: "In Greece’s southern mountains, the tall fir trees that have survived many fires are now dying in huge patches. The main reasons are a long dry season, less snow that used to keep the soil moist, and swarms of bark beetles that eat weakened trees. Researchers say the damage is bigger than in past years and warn that climate change is pushing forests into new, dangerous conditions. They call for the government to act quickly and give forests help."
