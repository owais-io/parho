title: "Humans Are Among the Most Monogamous Mammals, New Study Shows"
summary: "A new Cambridge study looked at how often animals stay with one partner, and humans turned out to be one of the most monogamous species. Out of 35 mammals, humans rank 7th, with 66 % of siblings sharing both parents. Beavers are the most monogamous at 73 %, followed by meerkats at 60 %. Human monogamy varies a lot between groups. Researchers say this pattern may have evolved to help fathers care for kids and keep males from harming infants."
