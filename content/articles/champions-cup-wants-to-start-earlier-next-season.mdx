title: "Champions Cup wants to start earlier next season"
summary: "The Champions Cup organisers are thinking about moving the start of the competition from December to October. Coaches and clubs say an earlier kickoff would let top players be fit before the November test matches and give fans more early‑season excitement. The format has already driven up TV audiences and stadium crowds, but a tighter schedule could help ticket sales and travel. A new weekend layout is still under review."
