title: "Zohran Mamdani’s block party proves people want more politics, not less"
summary: "New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, celebrated his win with a huge block party that turned the whole city into a giant gathering. He used the event to show how he’s always opened politics to ordinary people—through viral street interviews, a city‑wide scavenger hunt, a job portal that drew 74,000 applications, and 15‑minute town‑hall chats. Mamdani says politics isn’t something that happens to us; it’s something we do together, and that’s why his big‑government plans focus on universal benefits and active citizen participation."
