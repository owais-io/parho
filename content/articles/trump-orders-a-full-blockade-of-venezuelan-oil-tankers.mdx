title: "Trump orders a full blockade of Venezuelan oil tankers"
summary: "Trump has announced a total blockade of all Venezuelan oil tankers under sanctions, following a US seizure of an oil tanker last week. He says the move will choke Venezuela’s main revenue source and that the country is surrounded by a huge naval force. Trump accuses Maduro of using oil to fund drugs, crime and human‑rights abuses, though there’s no proof. The blockade sent Brent crude up to about $60 a barrel, raising worries about global supply."
