title: "US Excluded From New Global Minimum Corporate Tax Deal"
summary: "Nearly 150 countries agreed on a plan to stop big companies moving profits to low‑tax havens, but the U.S. will not be part of the 15% minimum tax. The exemption was negotiated by the Trump administration after criticism of a 2021 deal. Tax watchdogs say this keeps U.S. multinationals able to keep profits in places like the Cayman Islands, undermining global tax progress."
