title: "Four GOP lawmakers push vote to keep Obamacare subsidies"
summary: "Four Republican lawmakers teamed with Democrats to push a vote that would extend Obamacare subsidies for three years. They signed a discharge petition, gathering 218 signatures, after GOP leaders declined to add the extension to a health bill. Moderates say letting the credits expire would hurt voters. The move means a House vote could happen in January. Republicans want other reforms, while Democrats support the extension. The Senate’s future remains unclear."
