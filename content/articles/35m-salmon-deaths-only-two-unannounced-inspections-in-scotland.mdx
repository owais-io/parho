title: "35m Salmon Deaths, Only Two Unannounced Inspections in Scotland"
summary: "Scottish salmon farms lost almost 36 million fish in three years, but regulators only did two surprise inspections. The Animal and Plant Health Agency checked 21 of 213 farms, missing the 20 worst sites. Animal welfare groups say the government’s claim of strong rules is wrong. Few complaints lead to actions, and inspection reports aren’t public. Parliament will ask farm owners to explain next month."
