title: "Dutch Parties Form Minority Government After Surprising Election"
summary: "Three Dutch parties—D66, the Christian Democrats, and VVD—have agreed to form a minority coalition after last year's election, where centrist D66 beat the far‑right PVV. The new cabinet will be led by the youngest prime minister, Rob Jetten. With only 66 of 150 seats, it must seek support from other parties to pass laws. The deal excludes the far‑right, and will focus on defence, homes, migration and the economy."
