summary: "About 1.8 million fixed‑rate mortgages will finish in 2026, so many homeowners must find a new deal. Rates have risen since 2021, but the Bank of England could cut them again this year, making a cheaper offer possible. Avoid the high standard variable rate, compare fixed and tracker options, shop online or use a broker, and watch for early‑repay fees."
