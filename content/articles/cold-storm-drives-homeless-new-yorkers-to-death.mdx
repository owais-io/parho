title: "Cold Storm Drives Homeless New Yorkers to Death"
summary: "During a brutal New York winter, cold‑related deaths spiked as homeless people stayed outside instead of shelters. Volunteers from the Coalition for the Homeless chased those on the streets, offering blankets, sneakers and bus rides to warming centers, but many declined because of fear of violence or past bad experiences. More than ten people died outside, and the city’s 30‑year average of cold deaths jumped to a record high. The crisis shows the gap between available shelter space and safe, low‑barrier homes."
