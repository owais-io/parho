title: "HSBC’s New Chair Appointment Leaves Board Confused"
summary: "HSBC just named Brendan Nelson, a former KPMG partner, as its new chair. The move has left the bank’s board and CEO puzzled, because Nelson didn’t openly campaign for the role and said he’d rather not serve a full term. No one on the board had strong banking or political experience, and the bank’s heavy ties to China add extra pressure. HSBC’s succession plan looked messy, leaving many wondering how the decision was made."
