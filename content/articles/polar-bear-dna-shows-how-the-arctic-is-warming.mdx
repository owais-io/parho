title: "Polar bear DNA shows how the Arctic is warming"
summary: "Scientists have found evidence that polar bears are changing their DNA because the Arctic is getting warmer. This shows that animals can adapt quickly, but it also means the environment is under severe stress. The Guardian’s reporter says it’s a small sign of hope, but we still need to cut fossil‑fuel use. While some countries are cutting emissions, many species, especially in the UK, are still declining."
