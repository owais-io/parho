title: "California Approves Plan to Eradicate Mule Deer on Catalina Island"
summary: "California wildlife officials have given the green light to a five‑year program that will remove about 1,800 mule deer from Santa Catalina Island. The plan will use hired shooters, helicopters and drones to kill the deer, with some captured animals sterilized and GPS‑tagged before being released. Local residents and conservation groups oppose the methods, arguing the deer are an iconic part of island life, while the conservancy says eradicating the non‑native herd will restore native plants and help endangered species."
