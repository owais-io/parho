title: "New Antibiotics Give Hope, but the Fight Against Resistance Is Far From Over"
summary: "Only 16 new antibiotics got global approval since 2017, most just tweaks of old drugs, so scientists worry about resistance. This month the US approved two new medicines for gonorrhoea, one made through a partnership between a nonprofit and a company, showing that new payment models can spark development. But resistance will still creep in, so doctors plan to use them sparingly, especially in poorer countries. Finding new drugs is still a huge challenge."
