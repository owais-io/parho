title: "Residents challenge plan to tear down Clockwork Orange estate"
summary: "A group of residents led by Adam Turk has started a court case to stop the demolition of the Lesnes estate, a 1960s Brutalist housing block in south‑east London that was featured in *A Clockwork Orange*. They argue the buildings could be refurbished instead of torn down, and that tearing them up would create huge greenhouse‑gas emissions and harm residents’ health, putting London’s net‑zero pledge at risk."
