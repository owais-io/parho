title: "Vogue Balls Enter New Zealand’s Mainstream"
summary: "In Wellington, 600 people watched a vogue ball at the national museum, where Māori and Pasifika queer performers danced, posed and flaunted their style. Vogue started in 1960s Harlem as a way for Black and Latinx people to resist racism. New Zealand’s scene has grown for over a decade, giving queer Māori and Pasifika a safe, creative space. The museum’s support has helped bring the culture into the mainstream and even added political messages about the Treaty bill."
