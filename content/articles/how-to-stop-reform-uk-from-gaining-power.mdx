title: "How to Stop Reform UK From Gaining Power"
summary: "A recent Guardian analysis shows that Reform UK is gaining support, but it’s not a guaranteed win for Nigel Farage. Data and expert commentary reveal that the party mixes right‑wing immigration policies with attacks on the working class, like harsher school rules and cuts to benefits. The piece warns voters to point out these contradictions. It also compares Farage’s potential power to Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, noting that the UK lacks EU limits that would keep a party from going too far."
