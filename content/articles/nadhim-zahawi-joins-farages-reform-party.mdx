title: "Nadhim Zahawi Joins Farage’s Reform Party"
summary: "The article mocks former Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, calling him a “rat” who has left the Conservative Party to join Nigel Farage’s Reform Party. It lampoons Zahawi’s past as a businessman and minister, his controversial expenses claims, his brief tenure as Chancellor, and his tax investigation. The piece ridicules his claim that he could make a political comeback, and pokes fun at his support for Farage’s immigration and free‑speech positions."
