title: "EU Relying Heavily on China for Key Minerals, Audit Says"
summary: "An audit by the European Court of Auditors says the EU still relies too much on China and other outside countries for minerals like rare earths, lithium and magnesium. The report shows the bloc’s plans to produce 42.5% of energy from renewables by 2030 won’t work because Europe isn’t making enough of its own raw materials. Without new mines, recycling or better supply deals, the EU faces a risk of supply shortages for tech and defence."
