title: "Broken Hill Still Struggles with Affordable Transport"
summary: "Broken Hill, a 17,500‑person town in western NSW, has very few ways to get to Sydney. Flights cost $300‑$400, the only bus leaves early for $50, and the long‑distance Outback Xplorer train runs just once a week at $70. Most seats stay empty, and the council wants another service. Travelers enjoy the scenic ride, but the lack of cheap travel limits visits and tourism."
