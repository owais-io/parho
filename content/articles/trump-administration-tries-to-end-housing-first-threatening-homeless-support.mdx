summary: "The article explains how President Trump’s executive order and federal cuts are targeting the Housing First model, which gives homeless people permanent housing first and then helps with mental health and addiction services. Sam Tsemberis, the method’s creator, says the policy is backed by strong research and has worked well in the U.S. and Europe.
