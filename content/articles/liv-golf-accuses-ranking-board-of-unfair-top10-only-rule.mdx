title: "LIV Golf Accuses Ranking Board of Unfair Top‑10 Only Rule"
summary: "LIV Golf has been granted official world ranking points, but only for top‑10 finishes in its events. The decision was made after the OWGR board cited eligibility gaps, such as smaller fields and no‑cut formats. The rule hurt players like Cameron Smith, Sergio García and Dustin Johnson, who dropped in rankings. LIV says limiting points to the top ten unfairly penalises consistent performers and threatens a fair, merit‑based system."
