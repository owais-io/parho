title: "Crypto crash in 2025 beats Trump’s hopeful outlook"
summary: "By the end of 2025, crypto lost about $1 trillion in value. Even though bitcoin hit an all‑time high of $126,000 in October, it fell again after President Trump announced 100 % tariffs on China. The market saw a record $19 billion wiped in a single day, and Ethereum dropped 40 %. Trump’s pro‑crypto rules helped a bit, but global tensions and AI‑stock declines keep prices shaky. Some big investors still believe crypto can survive a “winter.”"
