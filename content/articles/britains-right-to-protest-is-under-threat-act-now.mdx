title: "Britain’s right to protest is under threat – act now"
summary: "A new UK review of public‑order and hate‑crime laws could make it harder to protest, especially for Muslim and Black groups. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said laws must stop hate but have not been applied evenly, citing the Stephen Lawrence case. The report may treat repeated protests as a nuisance and use counter‑terrorism language to justify police action. Critics warn this would curtail civil‑rights history of persistent protest that led to change."
