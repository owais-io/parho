title: "Trump Cancels US Climate Rules While China Boosts Clean Energy"
summary: "Trump’s administration removed a key climate regulation that says dangerous gases are harming the planet, hoping to save $1.3 trillion. The move comes after a year of record‑breaking wildfires, floods and storms that cost the U.S. more than $115 billion. Meanwhile China has kept its carbon emissions flat for 21 months and is investing heavily in renewables, though some projects use forced‑labour and the country still builds coal plants. The U.S. reversal leaves global climate progress at risk."
