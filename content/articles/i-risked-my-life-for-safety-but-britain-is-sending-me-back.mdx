title: "I Risked My Life for Safety, But Britain Is Sending Me Back"
summary: "I fled a corrupt government that threatened me, so I crossed the Channel on a small boat hoping Britain would protect me. Instead I was thrown into a detention centre and told to be sent back to France under a new “one‑in‑one‑out” deal. The UK says it will safeguard asylum seekers, but critics say the policy is unfair, unsafe, and keeps dangerous smuggling networks alive. My story shows how vulnerable people are being hurt."
