title: "Court Keeps California’s Democratic‑Friendly Redistricting Plan"
summary: "A federal appeals court said California’s Prop 50, which lets the state use temporary congressional maps that favor Democrats, is legal. Republicans argued the maps unfairly target Latino voters and violate the Voting Rights Act, but the court disagreed. The decision leaves the new district lines in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections, and the case may still reach the Supreme Court."
