summary: "** Emma Cardinal, a 32‑year‑old from British Columbia, was frightened by ultrasounds after a podcast claimed they could hurt babies. She decided to have a free‑birth with no doctors or midwives, following training from the Free Birth Society (FBS). Her son died and she suffered complications. FBS, led by influencer Yolande Norris‑Clark, teaches thousands of “free‑birth keepers” but their advice is untested and risky. With few licensed midwives in remote Canada, health officials warn people about unlicensed birth attendants."
