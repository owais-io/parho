title: "Fasting Isn’t More Effective Than Regular Diets for Losing Weight"
summary: "Researchers looked at 22 studies worldwide and found that intermittent fasting, like the 5‑2 or time‑restricted plans, led to about the same weight loss as regular diet advice. The average loss was only 3 % of body weight, far below the 5 % doctors call meaningful. The review found no clear evidence that fasting improves life quality more than other diets, and most studies were short and low quality."
