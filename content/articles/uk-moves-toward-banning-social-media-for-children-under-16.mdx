title: "UK Moves Toward Banning Social Media for Children Under 16"
summary: "UK ministers will start a consultation next week on whether to ban social media for anyone under 16. The government says the discussion will look at age limits, safer design and a full ban, but no option is favoured yet. Many think a ban will give a clear message to platforms. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to support a ban this summer, after Australia’s recent law. Instagram has also introduced alerts for parents when teens search for self‑harm words."
