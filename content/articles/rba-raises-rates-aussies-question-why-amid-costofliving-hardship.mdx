title: "RBA Raises Rates, Aussies Question Why Amid Cost‑of‑Living Hardship"
summary: "The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted its main interest rate from 3.6% to 3.85% because it says the economy is “running too hot” and inflation could climb past 4.2% later this year. Governor Michele Bullock says it’s a temporary “adjustment” and not the start of a long hike cycle, but many Australians feel the higher costs for groceries, medicine and mortgages. The move comes as wages grow slower than price rises, leaving workers with less buying power."
