title: "Trump cuts spark donations to rural US public radio. Will it be enough?"
summary: "After the US government slashed funding for more than 1,500 public‑media outlets, many stations launched emergency fund‑raising. In Ohio, WYSO’s manager launched a drive that drew a record single‑day donation and many new members. Nationwide, 120,000 new donors gave $20 million – a sharp rise called “rage‑giving.” The money helps, but the $535 million cut is still far larger, and some stations are losing jobs and closing."
