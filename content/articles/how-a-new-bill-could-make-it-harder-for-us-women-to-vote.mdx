title: "How a new bill could make it harder for U.S. women to vote"
summary: "The Save Act would require people to show a birth certificate, passport or similar proof when registering or updating their voter record. More than 21 million Americans, especially people of color, low‑income voters and married women who changed their names, don’t have easy access to such documents. A similar law in Kansas kept thousands from voting, and Republicans say the bill stops “fraud” that actually doesn’t exist."
