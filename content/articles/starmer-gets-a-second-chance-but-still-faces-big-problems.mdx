title: "Starmer Gets a Second Chance, But Still Faces Big Problems"
summary: "Labour leader Keir Starmer gave a strong speech that helped calm his party after a row over documents from former politician Peter Mandelson. Some MPs thought his time was over, but his words persuaded many to give him another shot. Still, his popularity is very low, and Labour is trailing the Conservatives, the Greens and even the Reform Party in polls. Starmer faces difficult elections in the coming months, so his future is still uncertain."
