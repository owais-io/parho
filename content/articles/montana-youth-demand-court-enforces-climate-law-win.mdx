title: "Montana Youth Demand Court Enforces Climate Law Win"
summary: "Montana youth activists who won a landmark climate lawsuit are asking the state’s highest court to enforce that decision. In 2023 a judge ruled that Montana’s laws hid climate impacts during environmental reviews. The Supreme Court agreed, but lawmakers passed new rules that let the state ignore air‑quality standards and fossil‑fuel emissions. The youths petition says those laws are unconstitutional and threaten clean air. They want the court to strike them down."
