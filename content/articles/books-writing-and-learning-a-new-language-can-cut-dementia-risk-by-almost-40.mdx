summary: "A new study shows that people who read, write, or learn a foreign language throughout their lives have almost a 40% lower chance of getting Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers followed 1,939 people, averaging 80 years old, for eight years and compared those who did lots of mental activities with those who did very few.
