title: "Deepfake‑detecting software will be tested in Scottish and Welsh elections"
summary: "Election teams in Scotland and Wales are testing new software that can spot deepfake videos before the campaigns start. If it finds a fake clip, officials will alert the police, the candidate and the public, and ask social media sites to remove it. They also want legal rules that force platforms to take down hoaxes. The project could expand to all UK elections and is part of wider efforts to keep elections honest."
