title: "EU Loan and Putin’s Stubbornness Mean Ukraine War Will Continue"
summary: "The EU is backing Ukraine with a €90 bn loan, while Putin stays firm on his plan to keep the four eastern regions. In a recent press conference, he said he still wants those areas and won’t back down. Trump’s talks with Zelenskiy and the EU’s move show the West is trying to help, but the war is still likely to last into next year. Both sides have shown little willingness to compromise."
