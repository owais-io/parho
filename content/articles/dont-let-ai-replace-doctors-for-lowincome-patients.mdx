title: "Don't Let AI Replace Doctors for Low‑Income Patients"
summary: "A California company is using AI to give diagnoses in clinics that serve homeless and low‑income people, with doctors only reviewing the AI’s suggestions. The move risks inaccurate, biased results that could deepen health inequities, as studies show AI often misdiagnoses Black and low‑income patients. Several lawsuits claim AI wrongly denied Medicare coverage, showing how AI can cut off essential care for the vulnerable. Patients should get human‑led, fair care instead."
