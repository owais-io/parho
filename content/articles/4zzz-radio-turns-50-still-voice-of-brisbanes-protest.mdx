title: "4ZZZ Radio Turns 50, Still Voice of Brisbane’s Protest"
summary: "4ZZZ Radio, Brisbane’s longest‑running community station, marks its 50th birthday. Founded in 1975, it grew out of a city that was tight‑lipped under a conservative government and became the only local station playing Brisbane bands. It survived an 1988 eviction, moved to a former Communist Party building, and kept radical shows – from a prison‑broadcast that helped close Boggo Road Jail to early LGBT and transgender programmes. Volunteers keep the station alive, and this year it hosts concerts and an exhibition."
