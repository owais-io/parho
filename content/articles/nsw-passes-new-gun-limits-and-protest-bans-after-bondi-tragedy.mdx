It also gives police power to stop street protests for up to three months if a terrorism threat is declared. The law, voted through at 2:51 am, was backed by Labor and the Liberals but opposed by the Nationals, Shooters and Farmers. Critics say it limits civil liberties and plan a court challenge."
