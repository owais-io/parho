title: "China’s New Economic Push Could Hurt the UK, and Britain’s Reply Is Too Quiet"
summary: "China is now pushing a big new plan to dominate high‑tech industries like electric cars and chips. It wants more state support for factories and stronger domestic demand, but that could hurt global supply chains and raise prices. Britain has only reacted mildly, working with the EU on steel and setting up a trade‑remedy office. The UK must speak up more and understand how China’s “second shock” will affect its businesses and jobs."
