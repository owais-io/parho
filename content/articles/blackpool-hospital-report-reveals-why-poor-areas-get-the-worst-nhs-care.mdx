title: "Blackpool Hospital Report Reveals Why Poor Areas Get the Worst NHS Care"
summary: "A leaked report on Blackpool Victoria Hospital shows a toxic workplace with bullying and racism, causing staff to quit and hurting patients. The problem is part of a bigger pattern: hospitals in the UK’s poorest areas are the weakest. These places have many people with long‑term illnesses, limited GP access, and low private income, making it hard to keep doctors and nurses. New government plans aim to shift care to communities, but large budget cuts threaten to worsen the situation."
