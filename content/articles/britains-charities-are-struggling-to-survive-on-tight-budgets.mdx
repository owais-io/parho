title: "Britain’s charities are struggling to survive on tight budgets"
summary: "Charities across Britain are under a financial squeeze. Austerity, the pandemic and a cost‑of‑living crisis have pushed demand for help up, while state grants have fallen and donations hit a low. Big groups like Samaritans and Macmillan are cutting staff and services, and many small local charities are running out of money. Labour’s new covenant promises support, but without real funding and volunteers the sector may not be able to keep running."
