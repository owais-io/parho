title: "South Korea Unveils Strict AI Rules, Faces Pushback"
summary: "South Korea has introduced the world’s most comprehensive AI rules, requiring companies to watermark AI‑generated art and label realistic deepfakes. Firms using AI for hiring, medical diagnosis, or loans must conduct risk checks and keep safety reports. Start‑ups say the rules are hard to meet, and civil‑society groups say they fail to protect users. The government says the law will reduce legal confusion and help Korea become a leading hub, but critics warn it creates unfair rules and gaps in rights protection."
