title: "Is the UK economy really that bad?"
summary: "The article looks at why many feel the UK economy is in trouble, but says the picture is more mixed. Wages have caught up with inflation, so salaries are stronger than the headline cost‑of‑living figure suggests. Housing prices have out‑paced incomes, making homes hard to buy. The NHS and other services are stretched because of low investment and an ageing population. The author suggests higher taxes on wealth and top earners could fund needed improvements."
