summary: "England lost the Ashes series 4‑0, and the England and Wales Cricket Board says it won’t replace the whole senior team after the defeat. A review of the tour will happen after the last Test, and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, will face the most pressure because his ‘Bazball’ plan didn’t work in Australia. The ECB wants to keep some familiar faces, but may make changes if the remaining games stay bad."
