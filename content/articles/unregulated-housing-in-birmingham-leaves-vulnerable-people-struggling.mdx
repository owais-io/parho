title: "Unregulated Housing in Birmingham Leaves Vulnerable People Struggling"
summary: "In Birmingham, many people with mental health or addiction problems live in unregulated “exempt” housing. These homes, often old student flats turned into cheap, large blocks, have no proper supervision or support. Residents move from place to place and often clash with others who also have problems. A church on Pershore Road has started giving food and bus tickets, but many still need more help. The rise of these houses has also raised local crime."
