title: "Rising living costs make it hard for low‑income families to afford school shoes"
summary: "Australia’s rising living costs are making it hard for many low‑income families to buy basic school items. A recent survey found that nine in ten worried about affording things like school shoes, uniforms, laptops, and extra‑curricular activities. Inflation has pushed child poverty higher, and researchers say kids in need can fall years behind in learning. The Smith Family is giving laptops, but many families still lack home internet and must cut corners at the start of each school year."
