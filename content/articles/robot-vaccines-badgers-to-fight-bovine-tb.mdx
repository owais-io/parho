title: "Robot Vaccines Badgers to Fight Bovine TB"
summary: "Inventor Tony Cholerton, a former zookeeper, built a robot that can give shots to animals without people. He first tested it on a tiger in London zoo, and now wants to use it to vaccinate badgers against bovine TB, the disease that hurts cattle. The machine uses sensors to find the animal’s rear, quickly injects the jab, and lets the animal leave calmly. If it works, it could reduce the need to cull badgers and help farmers keep cows disease‑free."
