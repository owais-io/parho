title: "Why Some People Feel Lazy: How the Brain Affects Motivation"
summary: "Scientists show that what looks like laziness can be a brain problem. Small strokes in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia can make people stop acting, even if they feel happy. The brain’s dopamine system, which pushes us toward rewards, also goes weak in these cases. Studies with students and patients suggest that planning ahead, regular exercise, and reminders can help. These tricks turn “no” into “yes” without hard thinking."
