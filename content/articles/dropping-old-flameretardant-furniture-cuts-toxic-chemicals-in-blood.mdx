title: "Dropping old flame‑retardant furniture cuts toxic chemicals in blood"
summary: "Researchers followed people for ten years in California and found that when families threw out furniture made with flame‑retardant chemicals, the levels of those toxic substances in their blood dropped about four times faster than in homes that kept the furniture. On average, blood levels fell by half in just 1.4 years. These chemicals are linked to cancer, brain problems, and low IQ in children. The study says replacing old furniture or regular dust‑vacuuming can help protect health."
