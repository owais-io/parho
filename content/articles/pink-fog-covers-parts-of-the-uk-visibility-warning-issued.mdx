title: "Pink Fog Covers Parts of the UK, Visibility Warning Issued"
summary: "This morning a pink‑tinged fog rolled over parts of England, turning the countryside a rosy shade at sunrise. The Met Office put out a yellow visibility warning for central and northern England because the fog would stay thick until 10 am. The pink colour is just an optical trick: the low sun’s light passes through many tiny water droplets, which scatter blue light and leave red. While beautiful, the fog still reduces visibility, so drivers should be cautious."
