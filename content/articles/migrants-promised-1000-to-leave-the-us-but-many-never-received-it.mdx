title: "Migrants Promised $1,000 to Leave the U.S. but Many Never Received It"
summary: "Project Homecoming offered $1,000 and free flights to people who agreed to leave the U.S. voluntarily. Many migrants signed the paperwork, but the money never arrived, was sent to the wrong person, or was returned. The Guardian’s investigation found that some people had to chase payment companies to get it, while others were left with detention, legal bans, and no cash. The program’s promises are unclear and poorly managed, leaving many doubting it."
