title: "High Court Says Ban on Palestine Action Was Unlawful"
summary: "The UK High Court has ruled that banning the protest group Palestine Action under terrorism laws was unlawful, but the ban still stands while the government appeals. Thousands were arrested and more than 500 charged after the group targeted Israeli arms firms, sparking a massive civil‑disobedience campaign. The court found the decision violated free‑speech rights and was inconsistent with policy, so police will stop arrests until the legal case settles."
