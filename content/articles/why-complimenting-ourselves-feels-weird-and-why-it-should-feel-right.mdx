title: "Why Complimenting Ourselves Feels Weird (and Why It Should Feel Right)"
summary: "A Stylist campaign asked 400 women what they love about themselves, revealing simple, proud statements like “I can cook something out of nothing” and “I’m really strong.” The writer shares how saying these things feels awkward because of cultural rules about humility. In many places, being proud can seem arrogant, but too much self‑deprecation can be just as harmful. A recent study shows that reminding ourselves of our good traits boosts wellbeing for about two weeks, so starting with a small compliment might help us all feel a bit better about who we are."
