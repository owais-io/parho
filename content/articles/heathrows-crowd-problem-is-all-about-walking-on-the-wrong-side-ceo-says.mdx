title: "Heathrow’s Crowd Problem Is All About Walking on the Wrong Side, CEO Says"
summary: "Heathrow airport is already feeling crowded because British and European passengers follow different walking directions—Brits stick to the left, Europeans to the right—causing collisions in terminals. CEO Thomas Woldbye says the fix is simple: standardise left‑right rules for everyone. Even if Heathrow builds a third runway and new terminals for 40 million extra passengers, the airport will still lose market share to other hubs. Meanwhile, Heathrow is pushing sustainable aviation fuel, subsidising airlines to meet 5.6 % SAF targets and help the UK hit its net‑zero goals."
