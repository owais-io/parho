title: "England’s Winger Injured Just Before Wales Match"
summary: "Immanuel Feyi‑Waboso, England’s fast winger, pulled up in training and is likely out of the Six Nations match against Wales. If he misses, the coach may try Elliot Daly or move other players like Tommy Freeman to cover. England still look strong after 11 wins, and coach Borthwick will have to adjust. Captain Jamie George will lead, as Maro Itoje is out. England are still favorites to beat Wales."
