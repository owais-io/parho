summary: "A new poll of almost 26,000 people in 21 countries shows most think Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” stance is helping China grow, not the United States. Europeans no longer see the US as a reliable ally and want more defence spending. Russia now views the EU as a bigger enemy than the US, while Ukraine looks to Brussels for support. The survey says the world’s power balance is shifting away from America."
