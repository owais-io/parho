title: "Surf tourism gives Peru’s ancient reed‑boat fishers a new chance"
summary: "In Huanchaco, Peru, fishers still use 3,500‑year‑old reed boats to ride waves while catching fish. Their catches are shrinking because of over‑fishing, plastic, and big motorised boats, and the reeds that build the boats are becoming scarce after a sewage spill. NGOs and the government are helping rebuild reed beds, but many fishers worry about their future. Surf tourism is now a growing income source, with young fishermen turning to surfing and opening surf schools."
