title: "One in Three Reform UK Council Leaders Question Vaccines"
summary: "About a third of Reform UK council leaders across the UK say they’re doubtful about vaccines. Four councils – Kent, Worcestershire, Warwickshire and Durham – have leaders who have publicly criticised shots. Health minister Zubir Ahmed called their comments dangerous and warned that doubt could harm vulnerable people. The party’s chair said a prominent doctor who raised cancer‑vaccine claims helped shape its health policy, but the party says it still supports proven vaccines while asking for more debate."
