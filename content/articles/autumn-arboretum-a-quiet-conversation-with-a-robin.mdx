title: "Autumn Arboretum: A Quiet Conversation with a Robin"
summary: "At the arboretum in late autumn, trees glow in reds and golds while most birds stay quiet. The author meets a robin perched on a fence that sings a soft, breathy version of its spring song—called a whisper song—when close to a person. He talks to the bird, and it replies with tiny notes. The piece explains how this gentle song attracts mates or warns rivals without getting aggressive."
