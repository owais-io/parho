title: "Europe turns against the US after Trump’s Greenland move"
summary: "A new poll shows that Europeans now dislike the US more than ever. After Donald Trump tried to claim Greenland, people in six Western European countries think the US is less friendly and less like an ally. Most still see the US as a powerful partner, but they want Europe to act on its own. They are willing to cut immigration, maybe spend more on defence, but most will not change trade or speech rules."
