title: "Over 3,000 migrants died crossing to Spain in 2025"
summary: "Last year, 3,090 migrants drowned trying to reach Spain by sea, a drop from 10,457 the year before. More people now take the risky route from Algeria to the Balearic Islands, where about 30 people ride per boat, and the Atlantic trip to the Canary Islands can hold up to 300. The Atlantic route still kills the most, with 1,906 deaths. NGOs say rescue help is slow and insufficient, and stricter borders force migrants onto more dangerous paths."
