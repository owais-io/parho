title: "How Much Student Loans Really Cost You"
summary: "The article argues that student loans are actually a tax, not a loan, and that calling them loans hides the real cost. The author, a former university head, explains how the system teaches young people to live on credit and delays repayments. The government sells parts of the repayment stream to private investors, turning a public tax into private profit. This creates a cycle of debt that harms culture and finance."
