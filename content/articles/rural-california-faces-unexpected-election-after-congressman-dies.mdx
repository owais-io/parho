title: "Rural California Faces Unexpected Election After Congressman Dies"
summary: "Audrey Denney, a Democrat, is campaigning in a long‑red district in northern California that recently lost its Republican congressman, Doug LaMalfa, to death. The special election will use the old district lines, while a regular election in November will use new, more balanced maps. Denney is fighting to turn the seat blue and help residents deal with wildfire damage, high insurance costs and low health care. Republicans say a win is unlikely, but the race could shift the House."
