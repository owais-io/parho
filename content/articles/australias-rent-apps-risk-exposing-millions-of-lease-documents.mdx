title: "Australia’s rent apps risk exposing millions of lease documents"
summary: "Australian rental platforms that let agents upload tenant and landlord documents are putting millions of lease files at risk of online hacking. A researcher found the links to PDFs can be guessed or crawled, so anyone can view sensitive data without a password. Some companies have upgraded security, but many still show no protection. Digital‑rights activists say the lack of safeguards is a huge privacy threat."
