title: "The Guardian’s Letter Debate: Should We Use “Reached Out”?"
summary: "The Guardian’s letters section is debating whether American slang like “reached out” is suitable for the paper. Stephen Chicken suggests swapping it for the more neutral “contacted,” but the Oxford Dictionary says “contact” is also an early‑20th‑century U.S. phrase. Readers also share quirky notes— from bathroom fan myths to a student’s 1960s customs mishap, a new AI helper, and a push for clearer lease‑hold language. The column invites readers to send letters for publication."
