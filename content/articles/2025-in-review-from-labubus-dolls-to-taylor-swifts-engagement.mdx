summary: "The year 2025 was full of chaos and absurd headlines. The dictionary chose “6‑7” as its word of the year, a quirky nod to the year’s silliness. Trump was inaugurated again, Los Angeles wildfires hit hard, and protests against ICE kept streets busy. Odd moments included labubus‑doll mania, a controversial American Eagle ad with Sydney Sweeney, and a kiss‑cam drama at a Coldplay concert. A high‑profile Louvre theft and, finally, Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce capped the year."
