title: "Buddhist monks reach halfway on 2,300‑mile US walk for peace"
summary: "A group of 18 Buddhist monks is halfway through a 2,300‑mile walk across the United States to promote peace, compassion, and love. Walking barefoot and avoiding lying down, they have faced injuries, a truck crash that left one monk without a leg, and a dog that needed surgery. They stop at every state capitol, draw huge crowds, and hope to convince Congress to make Vesak a federal holiday."
