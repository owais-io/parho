title: "First woman released under Colombia’s new prison‑release law"
summary: "In Bogotá, Jennifer Chaparro Pernet became the first woman freed under Colombia’s 2023 “Public Utility” law, which lets first‑time female offenders who head a family serve the rest of their sentence outside prison. She had been behind bars for four of a 12‑year term. The new rule aimed to free half of the 6,000 women in jail, but only about 200 have left so far. The piece also looks at the support she still needs and the gaps in the program."
