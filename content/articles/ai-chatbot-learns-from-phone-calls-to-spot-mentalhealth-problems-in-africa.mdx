title: "AI chatbot learns from phone calls to spot mental‑health problems in Africa"
summary: "People who call a Ugandan hospital’s helpline are helping to train an AI chatbot. Researchers are using those calls—after removing private details—to teach the system how people talk about depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts in local languages like Swahili and Luganda. Once ready, the chatbot could chat or text patients, flag red‑flags, and hand them to a doctor when needed. This could stretch limited staff, reduce stigma, and reach anyone with a phone."
