title: "Ukraine and Russia Agree Local Ceasefire to Fix Europe’s Biggest Nuclear Plant"
summary: "Ukraine and Russia have agreed a short‑term ceasefire around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, so repair crews can fix backup power lines. The IAEA says the deal will let workers get there safely, with demining already underway. The plant, under Russian control since 2022, isn’t producing power and relies on outside electricity to keep its fuel cool. The ceasefire is part of broader talks that may resume next month."
