title: "Starmer Plans to Fix Brexit with New Laws This Year"
summary: "Starmer is promising new laws this year to fix the Brexit deal left by Boris Johnson. He wants faster agreements on food safety, energy trading, youth travel and defence cooperation with the EU. He says a customs union is not enough and plans wider economic alignment that could raise the UK’s GDP by about 2 % and help regions outside London. The plan would cost money but could cut the £90 bn yearly loss caused by Brexit."
