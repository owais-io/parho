title: "UK must build a new factory to hit its 1.3‑million‑car production goal"
summary: "The UK’s plan to produce 1.3 million cars a year by 2035 is likely to miss the mark unless a large new plant is built. Current output is just 764,000 cars, a 15.5% drop last year. The industry sees Chinese manufacturers as the most probable investors for new electric‑vehicle plants. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s trade talks in China could spark that investment, but challenges like tariffs, cyber‑attacks and a volatile market remain."
