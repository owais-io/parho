title: "The Dutch Windmill Sawmill That Built the Modern World"
summary: "In 1593, Dutch inventor Cornelis Corneliszoon built the first mechanical sawmill powered by wind. It turned logs into ship planks in days instead of months, letting the Dutch build ships fast and dominate trade for a century. The machine used simple parts—windmill, gears, rods—to cut and move wood in a precise cycle. The article also challenges readers to recreate the basic motion with simple tools and asks for other great invention ideas."
