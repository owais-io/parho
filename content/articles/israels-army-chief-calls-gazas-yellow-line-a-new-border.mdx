title: "Israel’s Army Chief Calls Gaza’s ‘Yellow Line’ a New Border"
summary: "The head of Israel’s army told troops that the “yellow line” from Trump’s ceasefire plan is a new border. He said Israel will keep its positions that cover more than half of Gaza, including the main border crossing with Egypt. This pledge clashes with the October ceasefire that says Israel won’t stay in Gaza. Meanwhile, Palestinians are packed into a small strip, and Israeli forces are building concrete outposts and marking the line, raising fears of more fighting and a lack of international peacekeepers."
