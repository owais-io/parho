title: "UK bans Coinbase ads that link crypto to cost‑of‑living relief"
summary: "The UK’s advertising watchdog, the ASA, has banned Coinbase’s recent ads. The company’s videos and posters used humour to suggest that buying crypto could solve Britain’s cost‑of‑living problems. The ASA said the ads were irresponsible because they didn’t warn about the high risks of crypto and made the problems seem easier to fix than they are. Coinbase had a former Tory MP, George Osborne, on its advisory board, but it disagrees with the ban."
