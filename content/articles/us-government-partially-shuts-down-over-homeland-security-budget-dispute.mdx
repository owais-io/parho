title: "US government partially shuts down over Homeland Security budget dispute"
summary: "On Saturday, a standoff in Congress left several US departments, especially the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), without money. Democrats blocked a spending bill after two federal agents killed Americans in Minneapolis, demanding new rules for agents. The Senate passed a temporary package, but the House still has to approve it. The shutdown may begin Monday and could affect services, though ICE is likely to keep working. This follows a 43‑day budget pause earlier this year."
