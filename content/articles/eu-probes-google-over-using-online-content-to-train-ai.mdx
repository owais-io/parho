title: "EU probes Google over using online content to train AI"
summary: "The European Commission has opened an antitrust investigation into Google, saying the company may be breaking competition rules by using web publishers’ and YouTube creators’ material to train its AI services. Google offers AI summaries and chatbot‑style answers on its search page, and trains models with YouTube videos, but it pays neither publishers nor creators and does not let them opt out. The Commission will look at whether these practices give Google an unfair advantage over rival AI developers."
