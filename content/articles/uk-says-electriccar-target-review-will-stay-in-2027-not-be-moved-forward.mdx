title: "UK says electric‑car target review will stay in 2027, not be moved forward"
summary: "The UK government says it won’t rush its review of electric‑car sales targets; the study will still be published in early 2027, even though car makers wanted it sooner. Industry has pushed for weaker rules and the government added a loophole that lets firms earn credits by selling hybrids. Ministers point to the benefits of EVs for households and the environment, while the EU relaxes its 2035 zero‑emission requirement to 90%."
