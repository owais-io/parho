title: "UK construction slows sharply, worst dip since early Covid"
summary: "The construction industry in the UK fell into its worst slowdown since the first Covid lockdown, with the monthly PMI sliding to 39.4 in November – the sharpest fall since May 2020. Builders are cutting back on homes, commercial and infrastructure projects because of higher costs and uncertainty about the autumn budget. Jobs in the sector fell 1.8% year‑on‑year, the steepest drop in four years. Some economists say the PMI may be too bleak, but the overall picture remains grim."
