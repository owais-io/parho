title: "AI Helps UK Police Crack £800,000 Cashpoint Fraud"
summary: "UK police used an AI system called Nectar to sift through 1.4 terabytes of phone data from a cash‑machine fraud gang that stole £800,000. The software translated Romanian messages, mapped links between suspects and flagged possible crimes, letting detectives finish the case in days instead of months. Six men were jailed, but the use of Palantir’s AI has sparked worries about transparency and civil‑rights. MPs want stronger safeguards and more local AI options."
