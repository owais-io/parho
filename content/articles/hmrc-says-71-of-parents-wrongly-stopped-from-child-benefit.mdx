title: "HMRC says 71% of parents wrongly stopped from child benefit"
summary: "HMRC said that about 71% of parents who had their child benefit stopped last year were actually entitled to it. Only around 5% were fraudsters. The mistake happened because the tax office relied on incomplete travel records from the Home Office and dropped checks against payroll data. Parents got letters asking for a lot of paperwork and felt stressed. HMRC apologized, said it would add back PAYE checks and will fix the system."
