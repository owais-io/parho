title: "Will Ukraine Finally Find Peace in 2026?"
summary: "Zelensky said peace is almost ready, but real talks are still stalled. The U.S. and Russia made a draft plan that would force Ukraine to give up Donbas, which Kyiv rejected. Trump’s promise to end the war in a day has not worked, and Russia wants terms that address its “root causes.” Ukrainian soldiers are exhausted and many want a cease‑fire, but they fear a bad deal. New political shifts and the possibility of an election add more uncertainty."
