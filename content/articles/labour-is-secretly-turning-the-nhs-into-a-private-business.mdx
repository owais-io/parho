title: "Labour is secretly turning the NHS into a private business"
summary: "Gaby Hinsliff says the Labour government is quietly shifting the NHS into private hands. The plan cuts NHS staff and pushes more doctors to private jobs, so fewer NHS workers are available for patients. The government claims this helps reduce wait times, but research shows private work actually makes waits longer and pulls staff away from NHS care. Since the NHS trains future doctors, the move could hurt the country’s medical workforce. Experts urge the government to reverse this trend."
