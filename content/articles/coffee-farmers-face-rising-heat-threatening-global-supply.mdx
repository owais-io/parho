title: "Coffee Farmers Face Rising Heat, Threatening Global Supply"
summary: "In Ethiopia, more than 4 million families earn most of their money from coffee, but rising temperatures are making it hard to grow beans. Climate Central found that the top five coffee‑producing countries have had up to 99 extra days each year above 30 °C, hurting the most‑valued Arabica crop. Coffee prices have nearly doubled, and farmers say they need more climate‑finance and shade to survive. Governments must act on climate change to keep the world’s coffee supply steady."
