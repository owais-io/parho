title: "Why Labour Can't Deliver: The UK Government Is Too Big and Unresponsive"
summary: "Labour’s promises fail because the UK government is huge but ineffective. Over the years, the state has lost hands‑on power, outsourcing services and trimming its own skills. The Treasury dominates, keeping the government focused on money rather than growth, and a culture of “winging it” lets problems pile up. Other countries, like China and South Korea, actively shape industries and invest in technology. Labour needs new, stronger economic bodies, more money, and a willingness to experiment to make change happen."
