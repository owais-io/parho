title: "Nigel Farage’s Reform Party Faces Growing Uncertainty Ahead of 2026 Election"
summary: "Farage’s Reform party was close to topping UK polls last year, but recent polls show its support falling. The party is chaotic, with several leaders in quick succession and a lack of experienced ministers. Farage has tried to link himself to U.S. figures like Trump and Musk, but those names are unpopular. He relies on immigration as his key issue, which may not keep voters. The next election likely to produce a hung parliament, and Farage probably won’t lead it."
