title: "ICE Detentions Tear Families Apart Inside the US"
summary: "In 2025, about 3,800 children and babies were taken into immigration custody, most by ICE inside the country. Many were kids with legal status who were living normal lives in Minnesota and other states. The article shows how ICE round‑ups separate parents, siblings and cousins, leaving families to grieve and struggle while parents wait in crowded detention centers. The piece also links these actions to the Trump administration’s hard‑line policies and criticises the idea that Republicans truly care about families."
