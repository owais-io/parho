title: "ICE Raids in California Leave Residents Traumatized"
summary: "A Los Angeles hearing this week focused on the damage caused by Trump‑era ICE raids in southern California. Testimonies from people who were stopped, some U.S. citizens, showed fear, unfair arrests, and even detention fees. Congress wants to track abuses, and officials say the raids are a “national nightmare.” While the White House cites massive deportations, critics call the raids “racial profiling” and civil‑rights violations. The hearing set up a new oversight tool to document incidents."
