title: "FTSE 100 Rebounds Strongly Despite UK Problems"
summary: "The UK’s FTSE 100 jumped 21.5% in 2024, its best 12‑month run since 2009 and even out‑performed the U.S. S&P 500. The climb is due mainly to overseas sales for the index’s big names, plus gains in defence, banks, mining, pharma and energy. Companies are buying back shares and cutting costs, making the market cheaper and more attractive to investors. While it still lacks many tech names, the Footsie’s growth shows it’s far from extinct."
