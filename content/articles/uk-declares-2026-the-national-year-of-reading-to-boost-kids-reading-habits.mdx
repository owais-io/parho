title: "UK Declares 2026 the National Year of Reading to Boost Kids' Reading Habits"
summary: "Reading in the UK has dropped sharply—only one in three children ages 8‑18 read in their free time, a 36% decline in 20 years. To reverse this, the government has made 2026 the National Year of Reading, promising 72,000 free books for kids in need, a new Children’s Booker Prize, and automatic library cards for newborns. But success also needs more adult readers, better funding, and fully equipped libraries."
