title: "Farage Earns £400,000 a Year Promoting Gold in Pensions"
summary: "Nigel Farage is paid £400,000 a year to advertise buying physical gold for pension savings. His ads on Facebook and YouTube explain how gold can grow wealth, but they often miss key warnings: gold prices can fall, there are storage costs, and it doesn't pay interest. Critics say this advice is risky and only suits very experienced investors. The Advertising Standards Authority has looked into the videos, and Farage defends his role while juggling other media jobs."
