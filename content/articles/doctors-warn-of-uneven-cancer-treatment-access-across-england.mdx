title: "Doctors warn of uneven cancer treatment access across England"
summary: "In England, cancer patients are missing out on modern radiotherapy because NHS rules and funding gaps create a “postcode lottery.” Two advanced treatments—stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) and molecular radiotherapy (MRT)—are only available in a few hospitals, while only half can use surface‑guided therapy (SGRT). Doctors and professional groups urge the government to use the new cancer plan to cut red tape, expand access, and improve survival rates."
