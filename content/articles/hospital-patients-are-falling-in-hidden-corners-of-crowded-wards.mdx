title: "Hospital patients are falling in hidden corners of crowded wards"
summary: "A safety watchdog says that when hospitals get too busy, patients sometimes end up in corridors, storage rooms or gyms. These places aren’t meant for care and can make patients fall, get infections or run out of oxygen. Staff report that patients in these spots may not be seen right away if they get worse. Some hospitals are adding call‑bells and small nursing posts to help, but many still don’t want to use these spaces at all."
