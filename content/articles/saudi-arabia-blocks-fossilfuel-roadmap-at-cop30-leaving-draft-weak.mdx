title: "Saudi Arabia Blocks Fossil‑Fuel Roadmap at COP30, Leaving Draft Weak"
summary: "Saudi Arabia, along with other oil‑rich nations, vetoed a plan to phase out fossil fuels at COP30, so the final draft says nothing about ending oil, gas, or coal use. The text also lacks clear promises on climate finance and adaptation. Over 80 countries want a roadmap, but Saudi, Russia and India block it. Despite a fire at the meeting, the need for decisive action remains urgent."
