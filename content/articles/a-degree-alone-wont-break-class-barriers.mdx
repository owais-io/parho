title: "A Degree Alone Won’t Break Class Barriers"
summary: "A degree alone won’t guarantee social mobility, says critics of Prof Shitij Kapur, who argues the UK has too many graduates and that a degree is just a “visa” for jobs. They point out that class, race, region and discrimination still block equal opportunity. Apprenticeships help, but real success comes from employability skills, not just a diploma. The real problem is a weak economy, lack of political will and poor investment in jobs that use the talent graduates bring."
