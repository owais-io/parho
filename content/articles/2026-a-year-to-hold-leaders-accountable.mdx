title: "2026: A Year to Hold Leaders Accountable"
summary: "2026 could be the year voters finally hold powerful leaders like Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, Viktor Orbán and others to account. In the US, mid‑term elections might swing the House to Democrats, putting Trump’s presidency under scrutiny. In Israel, an upcoming election could force Netanyahu out after the 7 October attacks. Similar pressure is building in other countries, suggesting 2026 may bring justice for those who have harmed their nations."
