title: "Labour will block trans women from the main women's conference in 2026"
summary: "Labour has decided that in 2026, trans women will not be able to enter the main women’s conference hall or vote on policies. They can still join a smaller fringe programme, an evening reception and see exhibitions. The move follows a court ruling on gender and the Equality Act, and has sparked anger from trans‑rights supporters while some gender‑critical groups say it’s a step forward. Labour says it wants to balance the law and fairness."
