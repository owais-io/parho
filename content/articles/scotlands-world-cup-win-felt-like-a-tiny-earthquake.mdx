title: "Scotland’s World Cup win felt like a tiny earthquake"
summary: "When Scotland beat Denmark 4‑2 to qualify for the 2026 World Cup after 28 years, the cheers were so loud that seismometers at Hampden Park recorded a tiny tremor. The British Geological Survey said the surge, triggered by Kenny McLean’s halfway‑line goal, was like a very small earthquake – enough to power 25‑40 car batteries. Kieran Tierney’s stoppage‑time goal also produced a weaker read. Scotland now heads to the US‑Canada‑Mexico draw."
