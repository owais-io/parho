title: "Russia’s Attacks Leave Ukraine Without Heat"
summary: "Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s heating plants are cutting off heat for thousands of apartment blocks. The country’s old Soviet‑style system, where one power plant supplies hot water to whole neighbourhoods, is easy to hit. Since the war began, Kyiv’s residents have faced sub‑zero temperatures, power cuts, and even deaths from the cold. The EU has sent generators to help. Many residents have had to set up tents or use candles for warmth."
