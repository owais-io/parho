title: "South Korea’s Birthrate Increases Again Because of a New Generation of Parents"
summary: "In 2025 South Korea had its biggest birth rise in 15 years, with 254,500 babies. The jump is mainly because a group born in the early 1990s, now in their early thirties, are having kids – called “echo boomers”. Marriage rates are also coming back after Covid, and more women want children. But the overall population is still shrinking, and experts warn the boost will fade by 2027."
