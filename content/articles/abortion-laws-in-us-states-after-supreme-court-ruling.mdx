title: "Abortion Laws in U.S. States After Supreme Court Ruling"
summary: "After the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, abortion rules now vary by state. 13 states have total bans, four others allow abortions only up to about six weeks. Some states are fighting legal battles, while others use ballots to decide. Missouri’s 2024 vote protected rights, but a court case has blocked clinics; a new 2026 measure could reinstate a ban. The result is a patchwork: clinics are scarce in the South and Midwest but more available on coasts."
