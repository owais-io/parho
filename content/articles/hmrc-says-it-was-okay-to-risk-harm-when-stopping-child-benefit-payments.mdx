title: "HMRC says it was okay to risk harm when stopping child benefit payments"
summary: "HMRC cut almost 24,000 child‑benefit payments by using travel records from the Home Office that were missing a lot of trips. Most families who had their money stopped were still in the UK, and only about 4 % were found to have over‑claimed. The tax agency said the chance of harming people was “minimal”, but parents faced big stress and lost money. After the story broke, HMRC said it will add extra checks before stopping payments again."
