title: "Labour minister quits after falsely linking journalists to Russian ties"
summary: "Labour minister Josh Simons resigned after emails showed he wrongly accused reporters of being part of a “pro‑Kremlin” network. The claim followed a Guardian exposé that he had hired a lobbying firm to investigate journalists covering his think‑tank’s funding. The investigation found no breaches of the ministerial code, but his actions were seen as damaging and a distraction from government work."
