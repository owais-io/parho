title: "UK Drivers Are Paying Too Much for Fuel, Says Consumer Watchdog"
summary: "The UK consumer watchdog says drivers are being overcharged for petrol and diesel. Fuel retailers say they can’t lower prices because of higher costs like wages and electricity, but the watchdog found those costs don’t explain the high prices. Fuel margins stay high, meaning competition is weak. The report shows prices have only fallen a little, even though wholesale costs have dropped by more than 7p a litre. A new fuel‑finder tool will let drivers compare prices in real time."
