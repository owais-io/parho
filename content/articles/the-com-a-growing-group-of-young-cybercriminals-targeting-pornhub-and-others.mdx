title: "The Com: A Growing Group of Young Cybercriminals Targeting Pornhub and Others"
summary: "The Com is a loose network of English‑speaking cybercriminals, mostly 16‑25 year olds, who run everything from ransomware attacks to sextortion. Recent victims were Pornhub premium users, whose search histories were stolen by the ShinyHunters group. Other factions, such as Scattered Spider, target big retailers with ransomware, while an “In‑Real‑Life” wing calls in fake bomb threats and “swatting” attacks. Law‑enforcement agencies say the gang is growing, with hundreds of investigations and many minors involved."
