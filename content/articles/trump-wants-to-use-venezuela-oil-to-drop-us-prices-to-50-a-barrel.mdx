title: "Trump Wants to Use Venezuela Oil to Drop U.S. Prices to $50 a Barrel"
summary: "Donald Trump says he wants to tap Venezuela's huge oil reserves to lower U.S. oil prices to about $50 a barrel. He says this would help ordinary Americans by cutting energy costs. The plan would let the U.S. control a lot of oil in the western hemisphere, cut out Russia and China, and use the profits to help Venezuelans. Critics worry it could disrupt markets and make oil companies nervous."
