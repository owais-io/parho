title: "Romania cuts pollution while its economy grows faster than ever"
summary: "Romania has managed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost 90% since 1990 while doubling its GDP. The change came after it joined the EU, closed old factories, and built a big mix of wind, solar and nuclear power. New solar farms and a 1‑GW wind plant are under construction, but the shift also left some former coal towns empty. The country faces questions about keeping up the pace and protecting jobs as it moves toward more gas and renewables."
