summary: "Bournemouth is almost finished selling winger Antoine Semenyo to Manchester City. The only thing left to agree on is how the club will pay the £65‑million release fee. City plan to spread it over three years, while Bournemouth expects a deal by Sunday or New Year. Semenyo will get about £150,000 a week and play a five‑year contract.
