title: "Anna Tims' Worst Customer Service Awards 2025"
summary: "Anna Tims, a Guardian consumer champion, gives out “Worst Customer Service Awards” for 2025. She names companies that treated customers badly—airlines like Ryanair, hotels such as Premier Inn, Vrbo and Airbnb, telecoms like Three, insurers, energy firms, and local councils. The piece highlights things like a phone‑contract mistake, a £100 admin fee, a missing water supply, a broken tree roof, and poor handling of bereavement claims. It shows how businesses and councils can still cause customer frustration."
