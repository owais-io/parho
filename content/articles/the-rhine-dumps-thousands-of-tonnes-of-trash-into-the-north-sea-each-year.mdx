title: "The Rhine dumps thousands of tonnes of trash into the North Sea each year"
summary: "Thousands of tonnes of trash, heavy metals, microplastics and other chemicals are carried by the Rhine into the North Sea every year, harming wildlife and people. Researchers found the river moves about 4,700 tonnes of large litter (over 25 mm) annually. A floating trap in Cologne caught almost 2,000 kg of rubbish, 15 % plastic and 28 % food/drink. The same mix is seen in other European rivers, and the waste can clog drains and increase flooding risk."
