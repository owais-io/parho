title: "Is Donald Trump healthy?"
summary: "Donald Trump, 79, has looked tired and less active in recent weeks. He’s spent more time at golf clubs, cut back on rallies and appears to nod off in press events. Doctors said his MRI was “preventative,” but experts doubt the need for such a scan. Some say he’s simply tired and older, and the speculation has tied into his declining poll numbers and waning political power."
