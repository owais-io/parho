title: "Should We Follow Germany’s Quick Window‑Opening Habit for Better Health?"
summary: "Germany’s quick window‑opening habit, called Lüften, has become a TikTok trend in the U.S. The practice means opening windows wide for a few minutes to let fresh air in, which can stop mould and lower the chance of catching illnesses, including COVID. Experts say it’s cheap and safe, but opening windows all night can waste energy and even cause fights between couples. Germans joke about the trend but generally agree it’s good, as long as it’s brief."
