title: "Conservatives plan to lift 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars"
summary: "The Conservative Party says it would stop the 2030 rule that bans new petrol and diesel cars and drop the requirement that car makers sell a growing share of electric vehicles each year. They argue the rules hurt the UK car industry and would cost taxpayers money. The party would still fund EV charging and say it would help keep jobs. Labour wants to keep the ban until 2035."
