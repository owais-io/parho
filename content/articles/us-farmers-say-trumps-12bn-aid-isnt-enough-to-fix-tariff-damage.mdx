title: "US Farmers Say Trump’s $12bn Aid Isn’t Enough to Fix Tariff Damage"
summary: "Trump announced a $12 billion aid package for farmers, but many say it won’t be enough. The package only gives about $50 per acre, while farms lost $34.6 billion last year because of tariffs and higher costs. Row‑crop farmers, especially soybeans, were hit hard by trade wars with China. More than a thousand farms could go bankrupt this year, with Arkansas hardest hit. Farmers hope a trade deal and new biofuel rules will help."
