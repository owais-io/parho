title: "Sydney Water Ordered to Clean Giant Fatberg at Malabar Plant to Stop Beach Debris Balls"
summary: "After a giant fatberg in the Malabar wastewater plant started sending poo‑ball clumps onto Sydney’s beaches, the state’s environment watchdog has told Sydney Water to remove the build‑up. EPA orders a full clean‑up, 18 inspections over three years, and new monitoring tech. Closing the outfall to access the fatberg would shut beaches for months, so the company is testing remote tools and AI to tackle the problem without major closures."
