title: "Day‑Night Cricket: Why the Pink Ball Isn’t Working"
summary: "Australia loves day‑night Tests with a pink ball because it pulls in big TV audiences and boosts revenue. But most cricket boards see little return. Only 24 of 554 Tests have used the pink ball, and in places like India, Pakistan and New Zealand the matches finished early, drew low crowds and the ball was hard to see. Players worry about catching and safety, so the format hasn’t taken off outside Australia."
