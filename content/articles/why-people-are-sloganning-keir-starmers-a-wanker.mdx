title: "Why People Are Sloganning “Keir Starmer’s a Wanker”"
summary: "At the start of 2026, fans at a darts match shouted “Keir Starmer’s a wanker.” The chant spread to football games, clubs, and protests. Starmer’s approval has fallen below 20 % and people dislike him more than Netanyahu or Hamas. The writer says he is a bland, quiet leader with no clear agenda, so voters have a blank target. This mix of emptiness and anger lets anyone project their frustration, making the chant popular."
