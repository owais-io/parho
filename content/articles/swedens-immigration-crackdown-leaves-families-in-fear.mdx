summary: "Sweden’s new immigration rules are putting families who have lived in the country for years into danger. After being denied asylum, many lose work rights and must stay in reception centres near Stockholm. The government now favors labour immigration and tightens citizenship and family‑reunion rules. People who have worked and studied in Sweden, including children born here, face deportation. The centres are crowded, stressful and unsafe, especially for LGBTQ and children, causing fear and anxiety."
