title: "Suicide After Domestic Abuse: Justice Is Missing for Victims"
summary: "Katie Madden’s suicide in 2023 shows how many people who kill themselves after abuse are not treated as potential victims of crime. In 2024, 98 suspected suicides linked to domestic abuse were recorded, and research suggests up to 1,500 such deaths each year across the UK. Police often ignore abuse evidence, and no law currently treats these suicides as abuse‑related crimes. Advocates call for new laws and better investigations."
