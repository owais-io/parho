title: "CDC urges flu shots after record child deaths"
summary: "CDC officials are telling doctors and patients that getting the flu shot is more important than ever, after a record‑high number of child deaths last year. A new strain, H3N2 subclade K, may make the vaccine work a little less well, but it still protects many from hospitalisation. The agency also reminds doctors to give antiviral medicine quickly, especially to kids and pregnant people. They’ve removed thimerosal from most shots and will keep watching the virus closely."
