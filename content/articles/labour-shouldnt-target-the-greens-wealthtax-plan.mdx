title: "Labour shouldn't target the Greens' wealth‑tax plan"
summary: "Labour shouldn't fight the Greens over their wealth‑tax idea. A 2% tax on assets over £10m could bring in £24 bn a year, and extra taxes could add up to £50 bn, enough to help the cost‑of‑living crisis and public services. Most Labour voters support it, and calling it a “fantasy” alienates people who are already drifting to the Greens. If Labour keeps attacking, it risks losing voters to Reform and missing a chance to tackle inequality."
