title: "Why I Love Extremely Hard Video Games"
summary: "I’m a fan of games that push you to the limit. The thrill comes from a tough challenge that keeps me stuck and obsessed, from Guitar Hero to Dark Souls, Baby Steps, and Hollow Knight: Silksong. These games force me to keep trying, and that drive helps me with real‑life learning and writing. While some find them frustrating, I see mastery as a goal that keeps me motivated and engaged."
