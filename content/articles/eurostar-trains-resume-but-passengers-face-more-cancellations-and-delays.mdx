title: "Eurostar Trains Resume, but Passengers Face More Cancellations and Delays"
summary: "After an electricity failure on Tuesday, Eurostar trains slowly started running again on Wednesday, but many services were still cancelled or delayed. The problem began when an overhead power line fell onto a train near the Channel tunnel, and a LeShuttle train also broke down. Thousands of passengers had to wait hours at Folkestone and Calais, with some given water but many left without food or drink. Eurostar warned of more disruptions and faced criticism for high fares."
