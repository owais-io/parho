summary: "Since the Australian government rolled out a new computer‑based system to decide how much home‑care help people need, calls to advocacy groups have jumped 50%. Many seniors say the algorithm ignores their real needs, leaving them with less support or no help at all. Workers worry that the tool can’t be overridden quickly, risking under‑assessed care and even early moves to nursing homes. The government has yet to explain how the system works."
