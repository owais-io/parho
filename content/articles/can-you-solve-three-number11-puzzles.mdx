title: "Can You Solve Three Number‑11 Puzzles?"
summary: "Three math puzzles focus on the number 11. First, a coach must split numbers 1‑11 into defenders, midfielders and forwards so each group’s total is a multiple of 11 – it’s impossible because the outfield players total 65. Second, the puzzle asks how many more 11‑times products are palindromes beyond 11×9; the answer is nine. Third, it finds the largest 10‑digit number using each digit 0‑9 once that is divisible by 11 – 9876524130."
