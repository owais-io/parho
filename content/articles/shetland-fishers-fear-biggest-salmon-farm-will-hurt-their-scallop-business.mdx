title: "Shetland fishers fear biggest salmon farm will hurt their scallop business"
summary: "In north Shetland, a new salmon farm will be built next to busy scallop beds. Local fishers, led by Sydney Johnson, fear the farm will flood the water and hurt their scallop catch, their main income. The council approved the plan, sparking anger from fishermen and environmental groups who worry about pollution and sea‑lice. The farm is part of a larger industry owned by big Norwegian and Canadian firms, and could bring jobs but hurt the local economy."
