title: "Milan plan to loan West Ham striker Niclas Füllkrug this winter"
summary: "Milan are lining up a loan of Niclas Füllkrug for the rest of the season after his poor start at West Ham. The German striker has failed to score in nine appearances and has been left out of squads, making him a surplus to Nuno Espírito Santo’s plans. West Ham bought him for £27.5 m last summer, but his wages and injuries have kept clubs away. Milan hope a loan will work, while West Ham look to sell players and sign strikers."
