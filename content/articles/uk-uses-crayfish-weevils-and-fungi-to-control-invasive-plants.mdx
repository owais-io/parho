title: "UK Uses Crayfish, Weevils and Fungi to Control Invasive Plants"
summary: "Scientists in the UK are releasing helpful animals and fungi—like weevils that eat floating pennywort and a psyllid that feeds on Japanese knotweed—to keep invasive plants under control. The plan aims to cut non‑native species by half by 2030 and saves labour. At the same time, they’re raising native white‑clawed crayfish in hatcheries to protect them from the disease‑carrying signal crayfish. The government also warns about pet raccoons that could escape and harm wildlife."
