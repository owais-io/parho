title: "Trump revives the Monroe Doctrine, threatens force in the Americas"
summary: "Trump is trying to revive the old Monroe Doctrine, which told other powers not to meddle in the Americas. He’s talking about using force in places like Venezuela, Panama and even Greenland, and has slapped huge tariffs on trade partners. He’s also meddled in elections in Honduras, Argentina and Brazil. The plan is meant to counter China and keep America dominant, but it could cause more regional tension and hurt US‑Latin America ties."
