title: "Why Gen Z protests toppled governments and fought corruption"
summary: "In 2025, young people in places like Nepal, Madagascar, Togo, Kenya and Morocco took to the streets and toppled governments. They were fed up with corruption, high unemployment, broken schools and hospitals, and poor public services. Activists say the protests were inspired by Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising and by seeing other young people fight back. They want leaders who keep money for people, give jobs, improve services, free prisoners and better education."
