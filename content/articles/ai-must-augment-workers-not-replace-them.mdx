title: "AI Must Augment Workers, Not Replace Them"
summary: "At last week’s Davos meeting, leaders warned that rushing AI into the workplace could hurt workers and widen inequality. Experts called for governments to invest in training, fair wages, and safety nets, while businesses should build tools that boost human skills. CEOs like Satya Nadella and Erik Brynjolfsson urged a focus on “augmenting” rather than automating. If AI only benefits tech giants, workers could face a job‑loss “tsunami.”"
