title: "Winter Olympics Must Reduce Carbon Footprint"
summary: "Because of climate change only a handful of winter‑Olympic cities will stay cold enough. Milano Cortina 2026 already needs artificial snow and big sponsors that add 40% more CO2. The IOC president says it’s a conversation, but real action is missing. Costs always overrun – the Games lose money – and many cities are losing the will to host. Experts suggest spreading events, reusing venues, and limiting travel to stay green."
