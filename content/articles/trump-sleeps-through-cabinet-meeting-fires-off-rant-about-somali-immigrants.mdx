title: "Trump Sleeps Through Cabinet Meeting, Fires Off Rant About Somali Immigrants"
summary: "During a two‑hour cabinet meeting, President Trump spent most of the time sleeping and later shouted a hateful rant about Somali immigrants, calling them “garbage.” He also talked about “fourth world war countries,” mixed up a dementia test with an IQ test, and made many false claims about the economy and drug prices. The White House said he was “listening attentively,” but the meeting looked more like a blur of sleep, slurs, and misinformation."
