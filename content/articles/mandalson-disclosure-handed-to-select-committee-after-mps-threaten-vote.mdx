title: "Mandalson Disclosure Handed to Select Committee After MPs Threaten Vote"
summary: "Labour MPs threatened to block a government plan to keep documents about Peter Mandelson’s links with Jeffrey Epstein hidden. To stop a fight in Parliament, ministers agreed to let the Intelligence and Security Committee look at the papers instead. The change was made by committee chairs Meg Hillier and Angela Rayner, and the opposition said the committee would be more transparent. The move keeps the government from having too much control over the release of the files."
