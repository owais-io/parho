title: "UK to Ban Boiling Lobsters While Still Alive"
summary: "UK ministers will stop boiling lobsters while they’re still alive, a move that’s part of a broader Labour plan to raise animal welfare. The ban follows a 2022 law that treats crustaceans as sentient. New rules will also end hen cages, pig farrowing crates, puppy farms, and use of electric shock collars on dogs. The plan tightens hunting laws and changes how farmed fish are slaughtered."
