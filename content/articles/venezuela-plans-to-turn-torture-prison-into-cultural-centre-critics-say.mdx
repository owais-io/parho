summary: "Caracas’s massive Helicoide building, once a notorious torture site, will be shut down and turned into a sports‑and‑culture complex for police families and the community. Acting President Delcy Rodríguez says the change shows progress, but human‑rights groups argue it erases a painful history and should instead become a memorial museum. Activists also push for an amnesty bill to free hundreds of political prisoners still locked in Venezuela’s prisons."

Acting President Delcy Rodríguez says the change shows progress, but human‑rights groups argue it erases a painful history and should instead become a memorial museum. Activists also push for an amnesty bill to free hundreds of political prisoners still locked in Venezuela’s prisons.
