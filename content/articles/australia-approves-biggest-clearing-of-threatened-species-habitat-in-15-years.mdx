title: "Australia Approves Biggest Clearing of Threatened Species Habitat in 15 Years"
summary: "Australia approved more than 57,000 hectares of habitat for threatened species to be cleared in 2025 – the amount in 15 years. That's about ten times the size of Sydney Harbour and more than double last year’s figure. Most clearing (98%) is in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales, and two‑thirds comes from mining projects. The northern quoll and night parrot are among the species at risk. New laws now require projects to prove a net benefit for nature before approval."
