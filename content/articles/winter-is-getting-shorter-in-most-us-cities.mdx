title: "Winter is getting shorter in most U.S. cities"
summary: "Researchers found winters in 80% of 195 U.S. cities are now nine days shorter on average. The change is driven by warmer temperatures that shift winter‑like weather later and end it earlier. Alaska lost 60 days of winter, while a few coastal cities see longer winters. A brutal recent blizzard shows extremes can still happen. Climate‑denial politics and EPA cuts add pressure on water, crops and the ski industry."
