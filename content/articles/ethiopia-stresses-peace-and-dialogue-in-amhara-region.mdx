title: "Ethiopia Stresses Peace and Dialogue in Amhara Region"
summary: "Ethiopia responded to a Guardian photo essay that said Fano militants controlled 80% of the Amhara region. The ambassador said that is wrong, because the government still runs most towns and security projects. He added that former Fano fighters were given a choice to join state forces or disarm, and many accepted. The letter also warned that Fano has no democratic power and that peace talks with the Tigray group are the real reason for stability."
