title: "Tents sent to Gaza refugees don’t protect against rain and wind"
summary: "Thousands of tents from China, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are not good enough to keep refugees in Gaza dry or safe. Experts say the fabric is thin, not waterproof, and the roofs let water in. Storms have already knocked over many tents, leaving about 235,000 people exposed. While some aid from Qatar, UAE and the UN meets standards, the overall quality is a big problem for people stuck in winter."
