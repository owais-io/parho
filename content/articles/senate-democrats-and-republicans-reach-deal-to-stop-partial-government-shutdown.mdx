title: "Senate Democrats and Republicans Reach Deal to Stop Partial Government Shutdown"
summary: "Senators have agreed on a package that keeps most of the federal government funded until September, while giving the Department of Homeland Security a two‑week extension at current spending levels. The deal splits the DHS bill from other funding bills, and the House must approve it. Trump has praised the agreement, and Democrats want reforms to how federal agents handle immigration enforcement. A brief shutdown could still happen if the House delays action."
