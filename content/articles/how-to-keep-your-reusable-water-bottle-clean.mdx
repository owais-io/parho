title: "How to Keep Your Reusable Water Bottle Clean"
summary: "Reusable water bottles can become breeding grounds for bacteria if not cleaned properly. Experts say wash hands, wipe phone, and rinse bottles with soap, bleach, or vinegar. Use hot water and a brush for crevices, especially lids and straws. Let bottles dry completely and wash daily. Metal or glass bottles are less prone to growth than plastic, but all need regular cleaning. A dirty bottle can carry E. coli and cause stomach upset."
