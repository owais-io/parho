title: "Islanders want tunnels to replace ferries"
summary: "Islanders in Shetland and the Western Isles want tunnels instead of ferries because the boats are slow, unreliable and costly. A campaign led by MP Alistair Carmichael has pushed the government to study the idea, giving £10 million for surveys. Tunnels could cut travel time from 3‑hour ferries to about 40 minutes and protect cables and farms. Critics say new ferries are cheaper and faster to build and improve safety for residents."
