title: "How Gen Z Can Handle Phone Calls, Small Talk, and Early Mornings at Work"
summary: "A new study found that almost 40 % of Gen Z employees dread small talk, 60 % worry about working with older colleagues, and 30 % are nervous about phone calls. Experts suggest practising calls with friends, jotting down notes before dialing, and staying calm with angry callers. For small talk, start with work‑related topics and keep it light. To beat early‑morning anxiety, shift bedtime earlier, prep the night before, and use flexible hours and mental‑health days."
