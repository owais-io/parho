title: "Publishers worry AI chatbots are ending their traffic."
summary: "Media companies expect a sharp drop in search traffic because AI summaries and chatbots are changing how people find news. A new report says traffic could fall 43% in three years and has already slipped a third in one year. To stay afloat, many are moving to subscription models, making short‑form videos, and training reporters to act like social‑media creators. The shift also hits lifestyle and travel stories most, while live news is a little protected."
