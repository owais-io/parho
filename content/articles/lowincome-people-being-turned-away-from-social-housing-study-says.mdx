title: "Low‑income people being turned away from social housing, study says"
summary: "A new report says England’s poorest are being turned away from social homes because of strict rent‑affordability checks and benefit limits. 71 % of housing associations say the benefit cap and frozen housing benefit make them fear tenants can’t pay, so they deny applications, especially for people with complex needs. The charity urges the government to adopt a Scottish‑style system that legally forces associations to rehousing homeless people, build more social homes, and adjust benefits to match real rent costs."
