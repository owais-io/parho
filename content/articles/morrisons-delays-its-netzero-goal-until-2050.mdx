title: "Morrisons delays its net‑zero goal until 2050"
summary: "Morrisons has pushed back its plan to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2035, extending the deadline to 2050 – a 15‑year shift. The grocer will aim for zero emissions across its whole supply chain, including farms and land use, not just its stores. Since 2019, it has cut overall emissions by 22% through energy‑saving projects and greener logistics. The company insists the change doesn’t soften its ambition, and it wants industry partners to help reach the goal."
