title: "Iron Supplements in Australia Often Contain Almost No Iron, Experts Warn"
summary: "Doctors say many iron tablets sold in Australia have very little iron—sometimes less than a few milligrams—so they won’t help people who are iron‑deficient. The supplements are marketed as “gentle” and “effective,” but the real reason they don’t upset the stomach is the almost‑zero iron content. Kidney‑dialysis patients and women who need iron can be misled. Experts urge doctors to prescribe specific products and call for stricter regulation from the TGA."
