title: "Exeter City asks Manchester City for extra FA Cup money – request denied"
summary: "Exeter City, a fan‑owned club, asked Premier League giants Manchester City to give them a bigger share of the ticket money from their upcoming FA Cup match at the Etihad. The club hoped the extra cash would help with debts and fire damage. Manchester City said it would stick to the normal 45/45 split, so Exeter won’t receive more than usual. The match isn’t televised, so no extra TV revenue."
