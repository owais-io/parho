title: "Police database problems may have helped kill Georgia Barter"
summary: "Georgia Barter, 32, took her own life after years of abuse by Thomas Bignell. An inquest found that police could not always see his past abuse reports in the national database, even though several forces knew about him. When he was arrested, officers lacked the right or ability to check the database. The Home Office said no changes would be made, and Barter’s mother is outraged, saying the system must be fixed to save lives."
