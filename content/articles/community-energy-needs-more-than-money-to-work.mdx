title: "Community Energy Needs More Than Money to Work"
summary: "Ed Miliband has promised £1bn to support community energy projects, but real progress needs more than just cash. Volunteers do the heavy lifting—turning policy into everyday advice, handling rules and safety, and keeping projects running. The government talks about cheap local power, but the reality is that long‑term funding for the people behind the projects is essential. Without it, local knowledge disappears when contracts end, and communities miss out."
