title: "Why Greenland Is Packed With Natural Resources"
summary: "Greenland is packed with oil, gas, rare‑earth metals, diamonds, gold and other minerals because its geology has gone through mountain building, rifting and volcanic activity over billions of years. Most of the island is still under ice, but warming temperatures are slowly exposing these deposits. While some argue the resources should be extracted, doing so would be expensive and have big environmental impacts."
