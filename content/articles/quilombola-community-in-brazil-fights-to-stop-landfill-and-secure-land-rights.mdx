title: "Quilombola community in Brazil fights to stop landfill and secure land rights"
summary: "A quilombola community called Menino Jesus in Brazil’s Amazon is fighting to stop a planned landfill that would destroy 200 hectares of forest. The group, descendants of enslaved people who hid in the jungle, has lived there for six generations and relies on the land for food and medicine. Only 4% of Brazil’s 1.3 million quilombolas have land titles, so they struggle for legal protection. Their leaders say the climate talks ignored their voice."
