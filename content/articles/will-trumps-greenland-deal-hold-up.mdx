title: "Will Trump’s Greenland Deal Hold Up?"
summary: "Trump’s talks with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte aim to boost NATO’s Arctic presence while keeping Greenland’s sovereignty. The U.S. wants access to Greenland’s minerals and plans a huge “Golden Dome” defence system there. The deal is shaky because Trump keeps changing his mind and the U.S. wants more control than Denmark is comfortable with. European allies are watching closely, and the plan still faces many hurdles."

The deal is shaky because Trump keeps changing his mind and the U.S. wants more control than Denmark is comfortable with. European allies are watching closely, and the plan still faces many hurdles.
