title: "Crescent Moon Rises Next to Bright Star Antares on 11 Feb"
summary: "On 11 February, a thin crescent moon rises next to Antares, the bright red star in Scorpius. From London, the pair will be just a few degrees apart, visible after midnight before sunrise. View the south‑east horizon from 5:30 to 7:20 GMT. The moon will be 34 % lit, guiding you to Antares, which is hard to see from the UK. It’s a great chance for sky‑watchers to spot this rare alignment before the sun comes up."
