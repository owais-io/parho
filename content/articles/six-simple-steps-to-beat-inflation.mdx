title: "Six Simple Steps to Beat Inflation"
summary: "Inflation means prices rise, so the same money buys less. In the UK the Bank of England keeps inflation near 2% by raising or lowering interest rates. To protect your budget you can: track your own spending with the ONS calculator, shop at discount supermarkets, lock a fixed‑rate energy deal, put cash in high‑yield savings accounts, and invest in shares or index‑linked gilts. Gold is another option, but it can be volatile."
