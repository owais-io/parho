title: "Trump Changes Story About Tulsi Gabbard at FBI Raid"
summary: "Trump said Tulsi Gabbard, the head of national intelligence, went to an FBI raid in Georgia because the state attorney general asked her. That contradicts his earlier claim that he didn’t know why she was there. Gabbard says she was sent at Trump’s direction to look at voting‑machine data. She has no police powers, so her role was unusual. The move is part of Trump’s ongoing push to investigate the 2020 election."
