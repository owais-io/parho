title: "New South Wales has the highest road death toll in 8 years, and Australia’s road fatalities are rising"
summary: "In 2025, 355 people died on roads in New South Wales, the most since 2017, and the state’s death rate climbed 28 from 2024. Speeding caused 134 of those deaths. Nationwide, about 1,332 people have died on roads so far this year, likely a little more than the 1,300 in 2024. Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania also saw higher numbers. Experts blame SUVs, mobile‑phone use, road conditions and low speed limits, especially in rural areas, for the rise."
