title: "US media hype Trump's raid on Venezuela, but should stay neutral"
summary: "US media, especially on the right, are praising Donald Trump's raid on Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, instead of staying neutral. Fox News and CBS give upbeat, even light‑hearted coverage, while serious outlets like the AP, Reuters, and the Guardian report on violence and repression. A few newspapers, such as the New York Times, were accused of waiting to publish because of Trump’s influence. Only a handful of journalists, like Robert Reich, openly criticize the action."
