title: "Massive Floods Threaten Indonesia’s Rare Tapanuli Orangutans"
summary: "A record 1,000 mm of rain in North Sumatra caused deadly floods and landslides that killed an estimated 33–54 Tapanuli orangutans, the world’s rarest great ape. The storms destroyed about 4,000 ha of forest and left another 2,500 ha unobservable, wiping out 6–10% of the already‑small population. With only a few dozen animals left, the damage makes extinction far closer, especially as mining and palm‑oil projects already threaten their habitat."
