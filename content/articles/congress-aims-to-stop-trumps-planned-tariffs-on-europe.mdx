title: "Congress Aims to Stop Trump’s Planned Tariffs on Europe"
summary: "US lawmakers from both parties want to stop President Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on eight European countries, including Denmark, the UK, Germany and France. Democrats plan to introduce a resolution that would bar the tariffs and could override a presidential veto if enough Republicans join. The move comes after Trump said he would raise duties if the US does not agree to buy Greenland. Some GOP senators, like Murkowski, already say the tariffs are wrong."
