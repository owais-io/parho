title: "I spent a day in a Birmingham school and learned shocking facts about how we learn"
summary: "I spent a day in a Birmingham secondary school, leading a “Deep Learning Day.” I saw a notice that says students remember 10% of what they read, 20% of what they hear, 50% of what they see and hear, 70% of what they discuss, 80% of personal experience and 90% of what they teach. I was shocked: most learning is forgotten unless it’s talked about or taught to others."
