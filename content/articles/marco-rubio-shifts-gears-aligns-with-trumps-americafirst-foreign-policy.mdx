summary: "Marco Rubio used to be a hard‑line foreign‑policy hawk. Since becoming the U.S. Secretary of State, he has leaned into Donald Trump’s America‑first agenda. He cut back on support for Ukraine, stopped funding USAID, and pushed stricter immigration rules. Rubio’s once‑promoted human‑rights stance has faded, while he now backs Trump on cutting ties with Venezuela and Cuba. Critics say he traded principles for political survival."
