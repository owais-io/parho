title: "Trump Administration Orders ICE to Detain Refugees After One‑Year Review"
summary: "The Trump team issued a memo letting ICE arrest and hold refugees who haven’t gotten a green card within a year of arrival. It targets about 5,600 people in Minnesota and reverses a 2010 Obama rule that said no arrest was needed. A federal judge in Minneapolis already blocked further detentions, calling them illegal. The move comes amid a broader immigration crackdown and low public approval."
