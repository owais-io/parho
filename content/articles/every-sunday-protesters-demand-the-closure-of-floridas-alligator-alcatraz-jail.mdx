title: "Every Sunday, Protesters Demand the Closure of Florida’s ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ Jail"
summary: "In the Everglades, people travel from all over Florida and beyond to stand in vigil every Sunday at the immigration jail known as ‘Alligator Alcatraz’. They protest harsh conditions, lack of medical care, and the way detainees are sent to Mexico without courts. Families of those held, religious leaders, veterans, and civil‑rights activists number in hundreds. A judge once ordered the jail closed, but an appeals court reversed the decision, so protests have grown louder, especially as the holidays approach."
