title: "Met Police Vetting Failures Let Serial Rapists Join"
summary: "An internal review of the Metropolitan Police found that from 2013 to 2023 the force cut background checks, letting thousands of officers and staff pass without proper vetting. About 1,400 people who should have been flagged were kept on duty, and 131 officers later committed serious offences, including rape. Notable offenders were David Carrick and Cliff Mitchell. The Home Secretary has ordered a full inspection, and the Met says it has tightened hiring standards and removed many offenders."
