title: "Canada Wants Answers from OpenAI Over Missed Police Alert"
summary: "Canada’s AI minister has called a meeting with OpenAI to ask why the company didn’t alert police after banning the account of Jesse Van Rootselaar, the 18‑year‑old who killed eight people in Tumbler Ridge, Canada, last year. The shooter had used ChatGPT to talk about guns and weapons, which flagged the account, but OpenAI said there was no clear plan to act. After the shooting, staff reached out to the RCMP.
