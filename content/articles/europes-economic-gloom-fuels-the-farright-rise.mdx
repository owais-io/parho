title: "Europe's economic gloom fuels the far‑right rise"
summary: "Europe’s economy has been hit hard by austerity, low growth and rising inequality. With many people feeling stuck and jobs scarce, far‑right parties paint migrants as the enemy and promise to protect “native” interests. In reality, migrants boost economies, yet politicians echo fear‑based slogans and the media spreads misinformation. The US now backs such messages, making authoritarianism more likely. Without new jobs and hope, democracy could weaken."
