title: "A Random New Poll Shows How Strange People’s Everyday Thoughts Can Be"
summary: "A new survey by More in Common asked silly‑but real questions about everyday life. For example, would you get a free weight‑loss shot, or do you think it’s cheating? Do grandparents deserve money for babysitting, and should adult children pay rent to their parents? Most people also believe wills should be split equally and think there’s an age limit for having kids. The poll shows that people’s inner thoughts can be surprisingly quirky and personal."
