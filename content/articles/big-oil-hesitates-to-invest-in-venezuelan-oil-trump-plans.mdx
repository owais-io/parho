title: "Big oil hesitates to invest in Venezuelan oil, Trump plans"
summary: "Trump says U.S. oil firms should pour money into Venezuela’s crumbling oil plants to boost production. But most U.S. majors see huge costs, sanctions, and a slow return on investment. Only Chevron, already tied to the state company, might move. Even then, the price of oil might stay low, cutting profits. With better prospects elsewhere, oil companies will likely stay put, making Venezuela’s vast reserves a long‑term gamble."
