title: "Biodiversity Loss Threatens UK Security, Says Intelligence Chiefs"
summary: "UK intelligence chiefs warn that losing biodiversity could endanger national security. A 14‑page report predicts ecosystems like the Amazon, Congo, boreal forests and coral reefs might collapse by 2030‑2050, sparking food shortages, higher prices, disease and migration. With the UK heavily reliant on imports, a loss of food‑producing land would make it vulnerable. The report urges the government to increase spending on nature and local food production while keeping aid for poorer nations."
