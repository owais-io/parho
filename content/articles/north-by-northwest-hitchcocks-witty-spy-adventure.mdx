title: "North by Northwest: Hitchcock’s Witty Spy Adventure"
summary: "In this 1959 film, Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a New York ad man who’s mistaken for a spy named George Kaplan. He’s snatched in the Plaza Hotel and taken on a wild chase across the U.S. The movie mixes comedy, suspense, and lots of over‑the‑top action—think plane‑chases in cornfields and train‑car flirtations.
