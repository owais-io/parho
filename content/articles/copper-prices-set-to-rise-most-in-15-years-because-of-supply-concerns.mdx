title: "Copper Prices Set to Rise Most in 15 Years Because of Supply Concerns"
summary: "Copper prices are climbing the steepest in more than 15 years, spurred by worries that supply could shrink. The metal, used in everything from power grids to wind turbines, has jumped 35% this year after US tariff fears and mining accidents caused traders to buy up stock. China and the US are also hoarding copper, pushing prices higher. While analysts say enough copper is on hand, growing demand from renewables may keep shortages looming."
