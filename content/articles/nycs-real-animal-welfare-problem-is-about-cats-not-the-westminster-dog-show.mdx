title: "NYC’s real animal welfare problem is about cats, not the Westminster Dog Show"
summary: "While the Westminster Dog Show gets a lot of TV and protests, the real animal problem in New York City is the huge number of outdoor cats. The city’s high rents and low vet‑care costs leave many people without affordable spay‑and‑neuter services. PETA’s push against trap‑neuter‑return is misguided, because sterilisation cuts disease, litter size and shelter intake. City‑wide, free spay‑neuter programs and public education would solve the issue."
