title: "Democrats Reach Deal to Stop Shutdown and Push DHS Reforms"
summary: "Senators agreed to a deal that splits a DHS funding bill from other spending bills, giving the department two weeks of money at current levels and preventing a shutdown. The move also buys Democrats time to push reforms that would curb ICE enforcement after the deaths of two Minneapolis residents. The plan still needs House approval, which is delayed until Monday. The article also notes Trump’s lawsuit over tax‑return leaks, Iran talks, and a DOJ charge against a man who attacked Representative Ilhan Omar."
