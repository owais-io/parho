title: "New Towns Won’t Fix the Housing Crisis"
summary: "The UK government wants to build many new towns, but experts say it won’t help those who need homes most. The plans focus on big new developments instead of fixing empty or underused land in current towns. Old towns have good transport, identity and communities that are shrinking. Using brown‑field sites, vacant flats and empty shops would create affordable homes faster and keep local shops alive. The letter argues new towns are good for developers but bad for ordinary people."
