summary: "A tiny U.S. research firm posted a dramatic, speculative scenario that AI tools would wipe out jobs, crush software companies, and trigger a mortgage crisis by 2028. The story warned that AI “agents” would replace many middlemen services, causing companies like Uber, DoorDash, Mastercard, and American Express to lose value.
