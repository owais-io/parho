title: "US inflation eases to 2.4% in January after tariff‑related price swings"
summary: "Inflation in the United States slipped to 2.4% in January, easing after last year’s price swings caused by President Trump’s tariffs. The consumer‑price index rose 0.2% from December, while core inflation climbed 0.3%. The White House claims the drop proves tariffs are keeping prices down, while the Federal Reserve keeps rates steady, hoping for future cuts. Voters, however, are unhappy with Trump’s economic handling, especially on rising costs."
