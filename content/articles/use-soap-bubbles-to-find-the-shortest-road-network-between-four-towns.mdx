title: "Use Soap Bubbles to Find the Shortest Road Network Between Four Towns"
summary: "Four towns sit at the corners of a square. The challenge is to connect them with the shortest possible road network. Options like an O‑loop, a U‑shaped route, or an X‑shape all waste extra length. The solution is discovered by making a plastic model and soaking it in soapy water – the bubbles instantly show the minimal layout. The author also talks about MathsWorld London, a new maths centre with a giant bubble machine, and invites readers to share ideas."
