summary: "Every Christmas, the UK could throw away up to 168 million light‑up ornaments and other battery‑powered toys. These lights are hard to recycle and can even cause fires. The problem is part of a bigger waste crisis: plastic exports are rising, sewage spills are common, and illegal dumping is spreading. Regulators are criticized, and some companies may even fail. The article says we can reduce waste by choosing better products, cutting packaging, and improving recycling plants."
