title: "Freezing tax thresholds will raise your tax bill"
summary: "The UK chancellor has frozen income‑tax thresholds until 2030‑31. When thresholds stop rising, pay rises push you into higher tax brackets, so you pay more tax. People earning £50,000 could pay about £8,000 extra over the next decade. The personal allowance shrinks, and higher‑rate taxpayers lose savings and dividend reliefs. Roughly 15% of workers were paying higher tax in 2021, but it could rise to 24% by 2030."
