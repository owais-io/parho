title: "Queensland’s New Gun Laws Face Heavy Criticism"
summary: "Queensland plans to pass gun rules that only let Australian citizens get licences, with exceptions for sport shooters and workers. The changes won’t cut any current licences and won’t limit how many guns a person can own, leaving Queensland with the weakest laws in Australia. The bill adds tough penalties for gun theft, drive‑by shootings, 3D‑printed weapons, and lets police use criminal records when issuing licences. Critics say the laws ignore safety, add hate‑speech bans, and threaten free speech."
