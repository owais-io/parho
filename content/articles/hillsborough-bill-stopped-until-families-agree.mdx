title: "Hillsborough Bill Stopped Until Families Agree"
summary: "Labour has put a hold on the Hillsborough law until it can reach an agreement with families of the disaster and the Manchester Arena attack. The bill would force public officials, including intelligence officers, to be honest and face prosecution for lying. Families want no opt‑out for security services, while the government wants agency chiefs to decide when officers give evidence. The delay means the bill will not be debated in Parliament for weeks while the parties negotiate."
