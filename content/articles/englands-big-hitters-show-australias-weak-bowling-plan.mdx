title: "England’s big hitters show Australia’s weak bowling plan"
summary: "England’s top batters, especially Joe Root and Harry Brook, played it safe in the Sydney Test, building a solid partnership after a shaky start. Australia’s bowlers were all fast, but they missed a spinner and the fourth bowler was weak, leaving England’s front‑handed batsmen unfazed. Starc was still the best, but without a good spinner or a strong fourth bowler, Australia’s attack looked uneven. The match felt ordinary, with England’s steady batting taking the edge."
