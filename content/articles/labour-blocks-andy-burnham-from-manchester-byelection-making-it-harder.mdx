title: "Labour blocks Andy Burnham from Manchester by‑election, making it harder"
summary: "Labour has decided not to let Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham run in the Gorton and Denton by‑election, making the race tougher for the party. The seat, created after boundary changes, covers a diverse area of Manchester with many young professionals, working‑class voters and a large Muslim community. Reform UK and the Greens are strong rivals, and polls say Burnham’s presence could give Labour a clearer win. Without him, the party may struggle to hold the seat."
