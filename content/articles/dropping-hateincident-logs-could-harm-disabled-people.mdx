title: "Dropping Hate‑Incident Logs Could Harm Disabled People"
summary: "Shabana Mahmood wants police to stop recording non‑crime hate incidents, saying it frees officers to focus on serious crime. Researchers warn that the loss of these logs would hurt disabled people who face everyday hate that often escalates into stalking, assault or forced moves. Only a small fraction of disability hate crimes are reported, and little data exists. Campaigners urge keeping the records and strengthening laws."
