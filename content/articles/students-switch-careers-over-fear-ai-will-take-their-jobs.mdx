title: "Students Switch Careers Over Fear AI Will Take Their Jobs"
summary: "A 20‑year‑old student dropped a computer‑science degree for nursing because he worries AI will take entry‑level coding jobs. Many young workers are doing the same, moving into hands‑on or “human‑skill” roles like healthcare, education, and trades. Older professionals also feel uneasy—some quit tech jobs or avoid AI‑heavy roles, while others use AI to stay relevant. The fear that AI will replace white‑collar work is already changing career choices."
