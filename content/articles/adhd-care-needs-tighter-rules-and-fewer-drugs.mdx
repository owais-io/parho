title: "ADHD care needs tighter rules and fewer drugs"
summary: "A UK psychiatrist warns that the NHS is overspending on ADHD treatment, with many unregulated clinics winning contracts. Because some providers lack Care Quality Commission registration, patients risk rushed, drug‑heavy care instead of thorough assessments and therapy. He argues that over‑diagnosis and a focus on stimulants hurt patients, calling for stricter regulation and more non‑medication options."
