title: "Trump Uses Rewards and Threats to Control Latin America"
summary: "Trump’s policies in Latin America use a mix of rewards and threats to shape politics. The U.S. has struck at Venezuela, killed over 100, and cut aid to governments that oppose it. Supporters like leaders in El Salvador and Argentina get money and security help, while those who resist, like Brazil’s Lula and Mexico’s Sheinbaum, negotiate quietly. Strong regional bodies have weakened, and left‑wing influence has faded, letting Trump’s control grow."
