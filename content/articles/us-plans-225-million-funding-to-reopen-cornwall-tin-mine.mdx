title: "US Plans $225 Million Funding to Reopen Cornwall Tin Mine"
summary: "The US is eyeing a $225 million investment to revive South Crofty, a tin mine in Cornwall that has been closed for 25 years. If funded, the project could bring 300 new jobs and supply tin—essential for electronics, electric cars and AI data centres—to the United States. Tin prices have spiked, but most supply comes from China and other countries with labour concerns. The move comes after a US‑EU‑Japan summit to secure critical minerals for tech."
