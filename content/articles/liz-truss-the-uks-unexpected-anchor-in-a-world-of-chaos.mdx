title: "Liz Truss: The UK’s Unexpected Anchor in a World of Chaos"
summary: "The article satirically describes the world as chaotic, from Venezuelan regime change to U.S. military actions, and then praises Liz Truss as the UK's steady point. It mocks her new low‑budget podcast, where she claims she was pushed out by a “Deep State” and invites conspiracists instead of former colleagues. The show gets few viewers and is full of unfounded claims about media and politics. It’s a tongue‑in‑cheek critique of her legacy."
