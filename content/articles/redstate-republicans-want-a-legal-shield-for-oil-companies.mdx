title: "Red‑state Republicans want a legal shield for oil companies"
summary: "Oklahoma and Utah lawmakers introduced bills to block climate lawsuits against oil companies unless the claims are based on specific laws. These measures aim to prevent state and local governments from suing Big Oil for misleading the public about climate risks. Environmental groups warn this strips accountability, could face legal challenges, and undermines the jury system. The proposals are part of a broader push by the oil industry to limit climate liability nationwide."
