title: "Australia Should Respond to Trump’s Rule‑Breaking Actions"
summary: "Trump’s aggressive moves—like targeting Venezuela—break international rules and let other powers like Russia and China act similarly. This hurts allies such as Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. Australia is powerful enough, with a track record of peace‑keeping and rule‑making, to counter this trend. The country should use its diplomatic clout to restore global rules and support a stable, rule‑based world order."
