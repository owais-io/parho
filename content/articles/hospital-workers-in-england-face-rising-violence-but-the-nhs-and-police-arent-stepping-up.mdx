title: "Hospital workers in England face rising violence, but the NHS and police aren’t stepping up"
summary: "Doctors, nurses and ambulance crews across England are being hit, threatened, and even sexually harassed by patients, especially young ones who bring weapons. Many staff feel the NHS and police do not act on these incidents, so they rarely report them. Shortages of mental‑health beds and staff leave patients who need help in regular wards, where they can become violent. As a result, hospital workers feel unsafe and overworked."
