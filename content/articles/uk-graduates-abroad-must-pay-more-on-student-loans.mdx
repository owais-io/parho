title: "UK Graduates Abroad Must Pay More on Student Loans"
summary: "UK students living in Europe will see higher student‑loan repayments from April, as the government cuts overseas salary thresholds. For Plan 2 borrowers in countries like Germany and Belgium, the threshold falls from £28,470 to £23,510, meaning more of their earnings go toward loans. The change, part of a wider review that froze UK thresholds, has angered thousands of graduates and added pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The government will announce the full list of affected countries in April."
