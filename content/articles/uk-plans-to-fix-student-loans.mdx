title: "UK Plans to Fix Student Loans"
summary: "UK student loans have turned into a debt trap for many graduates. Interest rates now add almost as much to the original loan as the debt itself. In recent weeks, MPs and the Education Secretary said the system is unfair and needs change. The Conservative Party proposed cutting course numbers to lower interest, but experts say it won’t solve the problem. The government must decide how to make loans fairer, but a solution is still uncertain."
