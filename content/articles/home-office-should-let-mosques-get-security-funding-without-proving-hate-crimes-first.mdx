title: "Home Office should let mosques get security funding without proving hate crimes first"
summary: "Britain’s Home Office has offered up to £40 million for mosque security, but many mosques can’t get the money because they must show they’ve been attacked first. Akeela Ahmed of the British Muslim Trust says the proof rule is a barrier – some mosques have waited 18 months for help. Recent attacks, including an axe‑wielding incident in Manchester, show why a simpler application is needed. MPs back the change."
