title: "England’s ADHD clinics are overworked and patients are left out"
summary: "ADHD doctors in England say their clinics are stuck in chaos. They get great training but then have too many patients, too few staff, and too little time. Report letters are often written by admin workers, not the doctors, so the paperwork doesn’t reflect the real assessments. Patients who pay privately are sometimes forced to wait months to join NHS care, and many get no timely prescriptions. The doctors aren’t doing it on purpose – the system simply can’t keep up."
