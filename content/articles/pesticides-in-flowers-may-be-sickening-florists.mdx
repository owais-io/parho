title: "Pesticides in Flowers May Be Sickening Florists"
summary: "Florists often handle flowers that carry pesticide residues. Many report dizziness, fatigue, headaches, skin irritation, and some say they’ve even had cancers linked to exposure. Because flowers aren’t required to have pesticide limits, workers can absorb chemicals through skin and breathing. Few studies exist, and most florists aren’t taught to use gloves or other protection. Experts call for better labeling, safety rules and more local‑grown options."
