title: "Trump Wants to Build a White‑Only America by Hating Immigrants and Women"
summary: "Trump is shouting at female reporters and many ethnic groups, especially immigrants from Somalia, Haiti, and Venezuela. His words are based on hate, not facts, and his policies, like aggressive ICE raids and harsh immigration laws, hurt people who work, study, and live in the country. He also pushes a “pro‑family” agenda that tries to boost white births, but it ignores the need for health care and real support. Communities across the U.S. are standing up against these attacks."
