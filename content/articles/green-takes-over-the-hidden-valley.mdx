title: "Green Takes Over the Hidden Valley"
summary: "While the rest of the countryside is turning gold and brown, a hidden valley stays lush and green. Ivy spreads over trees and banks, and rows of dark, glossy hart‑tongue ferns line the cliffside. Other ferns and a gray‑stemmed spleenwort grow on stone walls, while moss blankets every trunk, branch and even the riverbanks, turning the whole place into a green carpet."
