title: "Can parents pick embryos with higher IQ? The truth about polygenic screening in IVF"
summary: "Can parents pick embryos with higher IQ? A look at polygenic screening in IVF. In the UK, some couples are using a legal gray area to get genetic data that could predict traits like IQ from embryos. IVF clinics are only allowed to test for serious single‑gene diseases and chromosome problems. The data that might hint at IQ is not shared, but patients can request it under GDPR. Scientists say the scores are shaky and not ready for use."
