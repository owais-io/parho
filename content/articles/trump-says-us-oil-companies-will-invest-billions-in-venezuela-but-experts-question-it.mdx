title: "Trump Says U.S. Oil Companies Will Invest Billions in Venezuela, But Experts Question It"
summary: "Trump says U.S. oil companies will spend billions to rebuild Venezuela’s oil sector and boost output in less than 18 months. Industry experts say that without a firm U.S. government guarantee to reimburse the companies, the investment is unlikely. They predict a realistic timeline of 2–3 years and estimate the project could cost up to $80‑90 billion. Major U.S. firms have not announced any plans, and the administration has not yet offered the promised guarantees."
