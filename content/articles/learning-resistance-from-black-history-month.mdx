title: "Learning Resistance from Black History Month"
summary: "The piece reminds us that Black History Month should be more than hashtags and parades. It looks back at leaders like Martin King, Ella Baker, and Fannie Lou Hamer, who taught that real change comes from people working together in their own neighborhoods. Today groups like Students Deserve and Pillars of the Community keep that spirit alive, winning school‑budget wins, policing reforms, and disaster relief. The author urges us all to keep fighting, to build community, and to resist the pull toward chaos."
