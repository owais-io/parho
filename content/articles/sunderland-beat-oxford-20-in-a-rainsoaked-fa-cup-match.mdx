title: "Sunderland Beat Oxford 2‑0 in a Rain‑Soaked FA Cup Match"
summary: "Sunderland won their fifth‑round FA Cup tie against Oxford United, beating the reserves 2‑0. The match was played in heavy rain at the Kassam Stadium, so the game was slow and low‑key. A first‑half penalty by Habib Diarra gave Sunderland the lead. Oxford tried to get back in, but the visitors held on for the win. Sunderland's defence was solid, and the crowd of nearly 10,000 cheered despite the weather."
