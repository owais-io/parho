title: "Melbourne’s New Metro Tunnel Makes Me a Proud Train Enthusiast"
summary: "After almost a decade of watching Melbourne’s new Metro Tunnel go from plans to reality, I turned into a full‑time train fan. My Instagram went from cat pics to countdowns, and friends called me a “train ambassador.” On the opening day, I rode the new tunnel, got free swag, and saw the city breathe again after years of construction. The new stations feel fresh and exciting, and I’m proud to celebrate the city’s biggest transport upgrade."
