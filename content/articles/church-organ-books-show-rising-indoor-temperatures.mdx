title: "Church organ books show rising indoor temperatures"
summary: "Researchers at Nottingham Trent University discovered that the small red books kept by organ tuners in English churches hold decades of temperature and humidity data. By studying 18 such books, they found that the average summer temperature inside churches has risen from 17.2 °C in the late 1960s to 19.8 °C today, showing that buildings are warmer even when heating is off. Even a one‑degree rise can shift an organ’s pitch, so the records are useful for climate research."
