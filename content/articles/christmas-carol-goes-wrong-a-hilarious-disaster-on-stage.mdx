title: "Christmas Carol Goes Wrong – A Hilarious Disaster on Stage"
summary: "Mischief Theatre’s “Christmas Carol Goes Wrong” turns Dickens’s classic into a chaotic, laugh‑out‑loud play‑in‑play. The cast keeps throwing ridiculous props, losing lines, and improvising while the set collapses, giving the audience nonstop laughs. Characters like a nude actor, a clueless “Frog Cratchit,” and a giant‑sized Ghost of Christmas Present add to the slapstick. The show ends with a warm, chaotic finale that shows teamwork over Scrooge‑style grumpiness."
