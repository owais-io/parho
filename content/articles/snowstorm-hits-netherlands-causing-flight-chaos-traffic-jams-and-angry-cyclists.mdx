title: "Snowstorm hits Netherlands, causing flight chaos, traffic jams, and angry cyclists"
summary: "A heavy snowstorm that the Netherlands rarely sees caused more than 20,000 flight cancellations, road and train delays, and even some building damage. Cyclists were angry because bike lanes were left with snow while car roads were cleared. Snow is now rarer thanks to climate change – fewer snowy days than decades ago – so many think Dutch people have forgotten how to handle it. Drivers also delayed buying winter tyres, and the national airline ran out of de‑icing fluid."
