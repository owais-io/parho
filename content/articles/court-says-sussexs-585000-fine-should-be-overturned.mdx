title: "Court says Sussex’s £585,000 fine should be overturned"
summary: "The University of Sussex is fighting a £585,000 fine from the Office for Students. A high‑court review says the regulator’s ruling was unlawful, unreasonable and unfair. The fine stems from a dispute over a policy that aimed to protect trans and non‑binary staff and students, and the university says it wasn’t a governing document. If the court sides with Sussex, the record fine could be cancelled, saving the university money and protecting its reputation."
