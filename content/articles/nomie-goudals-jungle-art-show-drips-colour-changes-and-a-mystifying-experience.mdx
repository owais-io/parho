title: "Noémie Goudal's Jungle Art Show: Drips, Colour Changes, and a Mystifying Experience"
summary: "She turned a jungle scene into a 3‑screen art piece that drips and fades. The lights show ferns and vines, but the water keeps running, making puddles on the floor. Sounds of insects and beats mix with the visuals. The images slowly turn into washes of colour and then disappear, revealing the rough edges of the screens. The piece feels theatrical, but it doesn’t explain why water matters."
