title: "AI Helps Cut Emergency Room Wait Times in England this Winter"
summary: "Hospitals in England are using AI to predict how busy emergency departments will be, especially in winter. The tool looks at past data, weather, school holidays, flu and Covid rates to forecast patient numbers. With this info, staff can schedule more nurses and doctors for busy times, free up beds, and improve patient flow. About 50 NHS trusts already use it and report good results, supporting the government's AI push."
