title: "Reform UK promises £2 bn tax cut in Scotland by cutting green budgets"
summary: "Reform UK says it will cut about £2 bn from Scotland’s budget by scrapping what it calls wasteful green programmes, and use the money for a 1p‑in‑the‑pound income‑tax cut. Leader Malcolm Offord told Scottish voters that the party would make the tax system the same as the rest of the UK and reject another independence referendum for at least ten years. Critics say the plans are unrealistic and could hurt jobs and public services."
