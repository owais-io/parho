title: "NASA sends crew back to Earth after astronaut gets sick"
summary: "NASA has sent its four‑person crew back to Earth after one of them fell ill on the International Space Station. The medical evacuation is the first of its kind in 25 years and cuts the mission short, canceling a planned spacewalk. The sick astronaut is stable but the condition can’t be treated on the station. All four will leave to keep the rescue capsule ready. NASA will update in 48 hours. The ISS still has other crew aboard."
