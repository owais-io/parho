title: "Can Europe stop an unfair peace deal in Ukraine?"
summary: "Europe is facing a test as the US pushes a peace plan that favors Russia and forces Ukraine to give up land, shrink its army, and stay out of NATO. Trump wants Ukraine to agree by Thanksgiving or risk losing aid. European leaders, France, Germany, and the UK, are trying to stop this and even consider a €140bn loan from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine. If Ukraine cedes to Russia, the war could spread to Europe, threatening its security."
