title: "Bangladesh Jails UK MP Tulip Siddiq in Absentia Over Land Deal Allegations"
summary: "Bangladesh has sentenced UK Labour MP Tulip Siddiq to two years in prison, even though she is not in the country. A judge said she helped her aunt, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, get valuable land. Siddiq says the case is a sham, that evidence is forged and she never had a Bangladeshi passport. The UK has no extradition deal with Bangladesh, so she will likely never serve the sentence. Labour rejects the verdict."
