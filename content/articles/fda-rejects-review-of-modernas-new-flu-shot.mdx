title: "FDA Rejects Review of Moderna’s New Flu Shot"
summary: "US regulators said they will not look at Moderna’s new mRNA flu vaccine, even though the company had shown it worked better than existing shots. The FDA said the trials compared the new shot to ordinary vaccines, not to the best‑available care, and that the data were not enough. Moderna says the vaccine is safe and effective and wants a meeting to challenge the decision. This move could slow future vaccine development."
