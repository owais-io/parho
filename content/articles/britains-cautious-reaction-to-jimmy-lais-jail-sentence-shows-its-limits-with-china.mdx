summary: "Hong Kong media boss Jimmy Lai has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for sedition, the longest under China’s national security law. Britain has only offered private appeals for his release, while Brussels demanded he be freed. The case shows that Britain is reluctant to confront China even when a British citizen is jailed. The story highlights how Beijing uses the law to silence critics and how Western governments weigh the cost of speaking out."
