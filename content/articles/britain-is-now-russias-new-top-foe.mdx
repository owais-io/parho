summary: "Russia now points its finger at Britain instead of the United States, claiming the UK is behind a range of bad‑faith plots—from drone attacks to encouraging Russian pilots to defect. Moscow’s media says London is the main enemy and blames Britain for stirring up trouble in Ukraine. While Britain is praised for backing Ukraine and taking risks, the Kremlin’s propaganda treats it as a weakened but still dangerous rival. Russian officials rarely talk to the UK, preferring to use Germany and France as intermediaries."
