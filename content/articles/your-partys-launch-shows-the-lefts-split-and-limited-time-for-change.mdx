title: "Your Party’s launch shows the left’s split and limited time for change"
summary: "A new left‑wing party, Your Party, launched in July after getting 800,000 sign‑ups. At its first conference, members saw more drama than hope. Founders Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana fought over control, leading to legal threats and public feuds. The chaos pushed many to join the Green Party instead. The conference ended with a weak showing and questions about whether the party can bring real change before right‑wing forces rise."
