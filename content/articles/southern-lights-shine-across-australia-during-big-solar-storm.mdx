title: "Southern Lights Shine Across Australia During Big Solar Storm"
summary: "A big solar storm let the southern lights, or aurora australis, shine over large parts of Australia and New Zealand on Wednesday night. Experts say people as far north as Sydney and Perth might spot them, and Tasmania and New Zealand should see a clear display. The lights appear when charged particles from the Sun hit Earth’s magnetosphere, lighting up oxygen and neon. For best viewing, head to a dark spot, face south, and give your eyes time to adjust."
