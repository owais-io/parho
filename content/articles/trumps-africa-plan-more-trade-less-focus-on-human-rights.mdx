title: "Trump’s Africa Plan: More Trade, Less Focus on Human Rights"
summary: "Trump has moved U.S. policy in Africa from aid to trade, cutting USAID and tightening visas. He promises to help African countries end wars and grow economies, but critics say he ignores human rights and democracy. He even launched air strikes in Nigeria and tried to broker a peace deal in the Congo, though the effort faltered. Experts warn the new approach favors U.S. business interests and could push many African nations off the agenda."
