title: "EU Countries Approve Disputed Deal With South American Nations"
summary: "EU member states have approved a free‑trade pact with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, ending 25 years of talks. The deal sparked road‑block protests from farmers in Paris, Brussels and Warsaw, and split the bloc: France, Poland, Austria, Ireland and Hungary opposed it, while Italy and the EU’s president voted in favour. The agreement could give EU exporters €50 billion of new business by 2040, but farmers and environmental groups warn it could hurt local food security and drive deforestation."
