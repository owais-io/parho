title: "FTSE 100 Near Record High Amid Festive Rally, Even as Retail Sales Slip"
summary: "FTSE 100 is almost at its record high as the holiday “Santa Rally” pushes stocks up across Europe and Wall Street. Shares rise even though UK retail sales slipped a bit in November and early December, and government borrowing hit a four‑year low for the month. Investors feel hopeful because inflation is easing, the tech sector is stabilising after a dip, and a bank‑rate cut adds optimism, while some gloom remains in retail sales."
