title: "Labour Accuses Green Party of Dangerous Drug Plan in Gorton and Denton Byelection"
summary: "Labour is attacking the Green Party’s plan to legalise all drugs ahead of the Gorton and Denton byelection, saying it’s dangerous and could let Reform UK win. The party has launched ads that name Green candidate Zack Polanski and warn voters that choosing Green could help Farage’s party. Labour wants to keep its 13,000‑vote lead and stop Reform, while the Greens say they’re the only left‑wing option to beat the right‑wing threat."
