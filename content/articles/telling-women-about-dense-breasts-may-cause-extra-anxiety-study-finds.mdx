title: "Telling Women About Dense Breasts May Cause Extra Anxiety, Study Finds"
summary: "A study in Australia tested what happens when women learn their breasts are dense after a mammogram. Researchers split 2,400 women into three groups: one that was told nothing, one that got written info, and one that watched an online video. Those told about density felt more worried and confused, and more often wanted to talk to their GP, but didn’t feel more in control. The results suggest clear guidance is needed."
