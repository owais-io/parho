title: "The real life of professional darts: pressure, travel, and loneliness"
summary: "Professional darts looks glamorous, but many players face long tours, harsh crowds, and emotional strain. Even top names like Stephen Bunting say the sport can be lonely and stressful. The money is tempting—world champions earn £1m and many players earn six figures—but the travel and lack of a steady support network can lead to depression and burnout. Some players keep a normal job or rely on charities for help. The sport must offer more support."
