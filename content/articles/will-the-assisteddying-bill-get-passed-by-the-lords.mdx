title: "Will the assisted‑dying bill get passed by the Lords?"
summary: "The assisted‑dying bill passed the Commons but is now in the Lords’ committee stage, where peers review it line by line. Over 1,100 amendments have been submitted, many from opponents. Because there’s no deadline, the bill could stall and never reach a final vote. The government is adding extra sitting days, but if it runs out of time, supporters might try to use the Parliament Act to force it forward."
