title: "Environment Agency to Clear Huge Illegal Dump in Oxfordshire, Igniting Protest"
summary: "The Environment Agency will spend millions to clear a huge pile of illegal rubbish near Kidlington, Oxfordshire, because it could catch fire. A Labour MP from Wigan, where a toxic dump caused a school fire, is angry, saying the agency ignores poorer communities. The agency usually leaves such sites for the police, but it chose to act here because of the fire risk. The government says it will tackle waste crime in the new year."
