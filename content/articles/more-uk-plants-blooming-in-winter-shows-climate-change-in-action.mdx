title: "More UK Plants Blooming in Winter Shows Climate Change in Action"
summary: "Scientists say that more plants are flowering in the UK during winter because of warmer weather. A nine‑year study shows that for every 1°C rise in last‑winter temperature, about 2.5 more species bloom. In 2025, volunteers saw 310 native species – far above the usual 10 – and 646 species in all. This trend, seen even in 2026, shows climate change is changing plant life in everyday gardens."
