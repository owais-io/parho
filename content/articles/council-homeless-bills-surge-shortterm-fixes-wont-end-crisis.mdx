title: "Council Homeless Bills Surge – Short‑Term Fixes Won’t End Crisis"
summary: "Local councils in England spent £2.8bn on temporary homes for the homeless last year – a 25% jump from 2022 and double what they spent since 2020. The rise comes from the sale of social homes to private landlords and steep cuts to housing benefits. Some councils, like Liverpool, cut hotel costs by negotiating lower rents with landlords, but the real fix is building more social homes. If not, the bills will keep climbing."
