summary: "Anglo American, the UK miner, was set to give its boss Duncan Wanblad an extra £8.5 million bonus for finishing a $50 billion merger with Canadian Teck Resources. Shareholders and investors argued the bonus was too quick‑taken from a long‑term pay plan that should reward five years of performance. The company agreed to drop the move and will publish a new pay policy next year. Wanblad may still earn more under the existing scheme, but the extra bonus was scrapped."
