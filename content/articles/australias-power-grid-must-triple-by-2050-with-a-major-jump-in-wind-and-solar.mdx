title: "Australia’s power grid must triple by 2050, with a major jump in wind and solar"
summary: "Australia’s main power grid will need to grow three times its current size by 2050. Aemo says this means a five‑fold rise in big wind, solar and storage projects. Electricity use is expected to nearly double as more homes, cars and data centres switch to power. The upgrade would cost about $128 billion today, but would save money and cut emissions if done early. Delays would make the transition more expensive and less reliable."
