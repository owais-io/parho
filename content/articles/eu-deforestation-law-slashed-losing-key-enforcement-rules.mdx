title: "EU Deforestation Law Slashed, Losing Key Enforcement Rules"
summary: "The EU’s new deforestation law, once hailed as a bold step, has been trimmed back. Key rules that would force companies to track the source of palm oil, soy, wood and other products have been removed or weakened. This makes it harder to prove where the goods come from and to punish those who cause forest loss. The changes were driven by political and trade pressure, and critics say the law no longer delivers on its promise."
