title: "Police Federation Opposes New “Licence to Practice” Plan"
summary: "The Police Federation says the government’s new plan to give police officers a licence to practise will add pressure instead of fixing problems. The licence would require officers to keep training and could lead to dismissal if they fail. The federation worries about already heavy workloads, low pay and lack of support. It wants better pay, training and safer working conditions before adding new rules. Police leaders warn the plan could create harmful competition."
