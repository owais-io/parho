title: "Australia’s Parliament Returns, but the Coalition Is in Chaos"
summary: "Parliament is back, but the focus is on the Liberal‑National coalition’s split. The Nationals have left, leaving just 28 Liberals led by Sussan Ley, who may face a leadership spill with David Littleproud expected to win. The opposition benches will be the smallest since 1943, and internal squabbles like a treasurer acting as his own assistant add to the drama. Labour will lampoon the chaos while the government debates modest bills on copyright, beer taxes, and veterans."
