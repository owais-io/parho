title: "Australian News Missing From Microsoft's AI Summaries"
summary: "Researchers at the University of Sydney found that Microsoft Copilot’s news summaries mostly point to American and European outlets, with Australian stories appearing in only about one‑fifth of the links. Because users rarely click through to the original sites, local papers lose traffic and revenue, deepening existing problems like news deserts and shrinking independent media. The study urges new rules so AI tools reflect local news and help keep Australian journalism alive."
