title: "Councils Should Train Workers to Fit Home Insulation"
summary: "Common Wealth says councils should train their own workers to fit insulation, ditching private contractors that often produce shoddy work. By creating “home improvement corporations,” councils could roll out street‑by‑street upgrades, especially in deprived areas, using the £15bn Warm Homes budget. The plan would boost accountability, speed up repairs, and give locals more control. Critics point out that past schemes failed because they relied on short‑term private bids and lacked quality oversight."
