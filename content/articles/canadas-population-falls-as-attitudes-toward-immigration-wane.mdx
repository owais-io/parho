title: "Canada’s population falls as attitudes toward immigration wane"
summary: "Canada’s population dropped 0.2% in the third quarter, the biggest decline in over five decades, after Ottawa tightened immigration rules. The government cut international student permits, reduced migrant‑worker visas, and increased deportations. Polls show more Canadians, especially Conservative voters, are now wary of immigration, linking it to housing and job concerns. Experts say lower population growth may raise per‑capita income but could slow overall economic growth."
