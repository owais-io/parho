title: "UK science funding cuts threaten physics research"
summary: "The UK’s research budget plan will cut funding for physics, astronomy and nuclear science by about 30 %. This will shut projects, like a CERN partnership and new microscope, and could force universities to close departments or lose staff. Scientists worry that the new “bucket” system isn’t clear enough about who gets money and how projects will turn into benefits. The cuts risk hurting the UK’s global reputation and science community."
