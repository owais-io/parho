title: "Judge Drops Charges Against TikTok Streamer Shot by Immigration Agents"
summary: "A federal judge threw out the charges against Carlitos Parias, a TikTok news‑streamer who was shot by an immigration officer. The judge said ICE cut off his access to lawyers and didn’t give the court key evidence on time. The shooting happened when the officer fired at Parias after a standoff, but video shows the car wasn’t even moving. The case is dismissed, so the assault charges can’t be brought again, though Parias may still be held in ICE custody while his immigration case is handled."
