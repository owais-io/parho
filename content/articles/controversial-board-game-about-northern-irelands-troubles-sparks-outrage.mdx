title: "Controversial Board Game About Northern Ireland’s Troubles Sparks Outrage"
summary: "A U.S. company is still building a board game that lets players act as the IRA, the British army, or police forces during the Troubles. The game, which could last up to six hours, lets players plant bombs, make political deals, and try to end the conflict. Victims’ groups in Northern Ireland said the game could re‑hurt people and oversimplify a painful history. The game isn’t finished yet, but the backlash shows how sensitive the topic remains."
