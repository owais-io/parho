title: "IDF Units Made of Settlers Act as Vigilante Militias in the West Bank"
summary: "Israel’s army has let settlers join special reserve units called hagmar. These groups act like vigilante militias, using army weapons and freedom to attack Palestinians in the West Bank. Soldiers say they get little supervision and sometimes help settlers carry out vandalism, theft, and violence. The UN says the line between state and settler attacks is blurring. Since October 2023, 29 Palestinian communities have been displaced, and the army has faced several legal cases."
