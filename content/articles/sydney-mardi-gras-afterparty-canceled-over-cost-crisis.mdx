title: "Sydney Mardi Gras After‑Party Canceled Over Cost Crisis"
summary: "The 48th Sydney Mardi Gras will not hold its usual after‑party because the event has been losing money for years.

The decision sparked anger from activists who want the festival to stay community‑run and have called the move a mistake. The cancellation could boost smaller, local parties."
