title: "2026 Grand National Field Gets a Quality Boost"
summary: "The 2026 Grand National has a smaller, but more talented field than in past years. Only 34 horses will run, each with carefully set weights. The bottom horse, Jagwar, weighs 152 lbs, while the top dozen are all rated over 160. This shows the race has become tighter and harder to enter. Big names like I Am Maximus and Iroko are favorites, but there are still long‑shot runners with good odds."
