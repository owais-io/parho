title: "Co‑op Blocks Will Service for Russian‑Born Customer"
summary: "A customer born in Russia was told the Co‑op’s will service would not update his will because of his birthplace. After two months of silence, the Co‑op cancelled the appointment, claiming legal advice to refuse anyone born in Russia, even if they have other citizenships and no Russian ties. The government says a ban isn’t required unless the person is on a sanctions list, but the Co‑op insists on proof of renouncing Russian citizenship."
