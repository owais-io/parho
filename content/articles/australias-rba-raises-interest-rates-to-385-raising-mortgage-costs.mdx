title: "Australia’s RBA Raises Interest Rates to 3.85%, Raising Mortgage Costs"
summary: "Australia’s central bank raised its main borrowing rate from 3.6% to 3.85% in its first hike in two years. The move means home‑loan payments could jump by roughly $90 a month on a $600,000 mortgage, as banks raise variable rates. The RBA says inflation is still above target and may need more hikes to bring it back. While it will hurt homeowners, the goal is to slow rising prices."
