title: "Weight‑loss shots may look good but can backfire"
summary: "Doctors use drugs like Ozempic to help people lose weight quickly and even improve heart health. But a new study shows that when people stop the shots, they regain most of the weight and their cholesterol and blood pressure return to bad levels in under two years. The drugs also cause nausea, fatigue, and can affect birth‑control pills. They should be part of a long‑term programme, not a quick fix."
