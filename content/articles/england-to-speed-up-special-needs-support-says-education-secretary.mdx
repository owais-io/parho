title: "England to Speed Up Special Needs Support, Says Education Secretary"
summary: "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government will overhaul the special educational needs system so children get help in weeks, not months or years. The new plan will raise the threshold for an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP), meaning only the most serious cases get that legal right, but other children will still receive support. Parents worry that those who qualify at 11 might be reassessed. The government plans to spend more money on schools and SEND."
