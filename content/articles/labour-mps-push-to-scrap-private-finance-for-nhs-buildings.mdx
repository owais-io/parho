title: "Labour MPs push to scrap private finance for NHS buildings"
summary: "Labour MPs argue that using private money to build new NHS health centres will put too much debt on the system and hurt patient care. They point out that private‑finance projects cost more in debt payments than medicines and that the NHS already faces rising inflation and drug prices. MPs suggest instead cutting waste, using VAT on private hospitals and other funding methods. They want the government to stop the PFI plan."
