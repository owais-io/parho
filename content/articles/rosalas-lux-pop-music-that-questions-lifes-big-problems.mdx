title: "Rosalía’s Lux: Pop Music That Questions Life’s Big Problems"
summary: "Rosalía’s new album Lux sounds like a pop feast, but it also asks hard questions about today’s messy world. The singer uses Catholic symbols, 13 languages, and stories of female mystics to talk about suffering, hope and the clash between faith and everyday life. While critics worry the luxury vibe feels out of touch with rising living costs, the record shows Rosalía mixing bright beats with deep ideas, pushing listeners to think about crisis and meaning."
