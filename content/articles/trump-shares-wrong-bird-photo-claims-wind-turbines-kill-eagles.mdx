title: "Trump Shares Wrong Bird Photo, Claims Wind Turbines Kill Eagles"
summary: "While on holiday, Trump posted a picture of a dead bird under a wind turbine, claiming it was a bald eagle killed by windmills. The photo actually shows a falcon that died at an Israeli wind farm in 2016. Trump didn’t check the bird’s markings or the Hebrew text on the turbine. The image was from a 2017 Israeli report on bird deaths. His post sparked outrage among U.S. supporters, but the claim was false."
