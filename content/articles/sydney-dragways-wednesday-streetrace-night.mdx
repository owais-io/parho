title: "Sydney Dragway’s Wednesday Street‑Race Night"
summary: "Every Wednesday, drivers from all backgrounds gather at Sydney Dragway to race on a quarter‑mile strip. The meet accepts anything from hot hatches to supercars, with a $60 entry fee and $50 for a helmet. Veteran Ross Bielby says it’s about fun, not competition. Newcomer Sammy‑Jo Johnson, a former cricketer, hopes to win the NSW title and race in America. The close‑knit community loves the sport, but a single car can cost $30–40k."
