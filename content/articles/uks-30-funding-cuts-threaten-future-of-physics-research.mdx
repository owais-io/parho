title: "UK's 30% Funding Cuts Threaten Future of Physics Research"
summary: "UK science body UKRI plans 30% cuts to physics and astronomy budgets. The move risks shutting down one‑in‑four physics departments and halting the planned upgrade of the LHCb experiment at CERN. Experts warn the cuts will drain talent, push young researchers abroad, and hurt future tech breakthroughs that rely on fundamental physics. The cuts, said to be a “do fewer things better” approach, could destroy the country’s leadership in particle physics."
