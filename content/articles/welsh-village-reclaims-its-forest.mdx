title: "Welsh Village Reclaims Its Forest"
summary: "After a flash flood in 2020, Pentre village in Wales found its larch forest a danger. Natural Resources Wales had cut trees, but locals worried about safety and loss of land. A group called Welcome to Our Woods, with the Skyline project, worked with the government for 18 months to create a shared forest plan. They chose regular thinning instead of clear felling, aiming to keep trees healthy and give villagers jobs and a say in forest use."
