title: "Deacon Blue outraged that Reform UK leader used their song"
summary: "Deacon Blue, a famous Scottish band, said they are “appalled” when Reform UK's new Scottish leader, Malcolm Offord, quoted their hit song “Dignity” in his campaign. Offord used the lyrics to talk about working hard and buying yachts, while the band’s song actually tells the story of a council worker dreaming of a dinghy. Deacon Blue says the leader’s anti‑immigration stance clashes with the song’s message and they hope he is defeated."
