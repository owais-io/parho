title: "Bitcoin loses appeal as investors buy gold instead in 2025"
summary: "Gold jumped 70% while bitcoin fell 6% in 2025, showing investors prefer real gold as a safe haven. The crypto fell hard after an October sell‑off triggered by a Trump tariff threat on China, and the market lost more than $1 trillion in six weeks. Analysts point to risk‑off sentiment, higher Fed rates, weaker regulation, low liquidity and profit‑taking. Bitcoin’s mainstream integration has made it less exciting, and many still see gold as the better hedge."
