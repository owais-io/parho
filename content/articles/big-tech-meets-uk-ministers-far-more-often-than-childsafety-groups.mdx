title: "Big Tech Meets UK Ministers Far More Often Than Child‑Safety Groups"
summary: "Big tech firms like Google, Amazon, Meta, and X are meeting UK ministers more than once a day, while child‑safety groups only meet a few times a year. An investigation found over 600 tech meetings versus about 75 for child‑safety campaigners. Campaigners say the meetings show a power imbalance that could let tech companies push their interests over public safety. The government says meetings help grow the economy and improve services."
