title: "Americans Rate Their Mental Health at a Record Low, Poll Finds"
summary: "A Gallup poll shows fewer Americans say their mental health is good or excellent, dropping to a low of 72%. The share of people who rate it as excellent fell below 30% for the first time this year, a trend that began after the pandemic. Experts say this might mean people are more honest and less ashamed of mental health problems. The decline is strongest among college graduates and Republicans, while conditions like anxiety and depression have risen since 2019."
