title: "VA Stops Giving Abortions to Veterans"
summary: "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can’t provide abortions to veterans, even after rape, incest or when a pregnancy threatens a veteran’s health. A DOJ memo says the VA isn’t legally allowed to do so, and the Trump administration is rolling back a Biden‑era rule that let the VA counsel and perform abortions. While the VA’s 1,300+ clinics treat about 10 million veterans, the new rule could cut access in states that already ban abortion."
