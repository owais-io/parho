title: "First Time Spotting a Cetti’s Warbler"
summary: "On a rainy day at Walthamstow Wetlands, a 211‑hectare nature reserve in north‑east London, I finally saw a Cetti’s warbler—a tiny, elusive bird that’s rare in Britain. After hearing its loud song, I watched it hop among reeds, then dart away. The sight brightened a gloomy afternoon and reminded me how surprising city nature can be. The experience shows that even in a busy city, quiet moments with wildlife are possible."
