title: "More People Are Leaving Phones Behind to Enjoy Real Life"
summary: "More clubs are banning phones so people can live in the moment. A small sticker covers phone cameras in places like Berlin, London, New York, and the reopening of Manchester's Sankeys. The trend matches a sharp drop in social‑media use, especially among teens, and the fall of dating apps like Tinder. People are saying ‘posting zero’ and want real, low‑pressure connections. The result? More dancing, less scrolling, and a return to face‑to‑face fun."
