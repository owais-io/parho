title: "UK electric‑car charger rollout slows as worries grow about EV adoption"
summary: "In 2025 the UK installed only 87,200 electric‑car chargers, a small jump of 13,500 from 2024, the slowest growth in a decade. EV sales are rising but not fast enough to keep investors happy. New government policies, like a future pay‑per‑mile tax, and rising installation costs are making companies hesitant. Slow chargers are lagging, while ultra‑rapid ones are growing faster, but regional gaps still exist."
