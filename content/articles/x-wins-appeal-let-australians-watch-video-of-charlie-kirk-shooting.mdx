title: "X Wins Appeal, Let Australians Watch Video of Charlie Kirk Shooting"
summary: "Australia’s review board lifted a ban on videos of Charlie Kirk’s shooting after Elon Musk’s X appealed. The board changed the videos’ status from “refused classification” to R18+, meaning adults can see them with age checks. X said the footage isn’t gratuitous and is an important historical record. The eSafety commissioner said platforms must still keep R18+ content from under‑18 users. The ruling supports free‑speech rights."
