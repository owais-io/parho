summary: "US ICE agents have been accused of targeting people based on race and ethnicity. Citizens and legal residents report being stopped, questioned, and sometimes detained in parks, stores, and even cars across states like Minnesota, California and Florida. The incidents cause stress, fear, and changes to daily routines. Communities offer “know‑your‑rights” training, signs, and whistles to warn neighbors.
