title: "Fake Job Ads, AI Screening, and No‑Human Interviews Are Making Job Hunting Harder"
summary: "In 2024, almost half of new job listings are “ghost jobs” that don’t actually exist, tricking candidates into wasting time. Employers use AI bots to scan CVs and cover letters, sometimes favoring men, and many interviews are now run by chat‑bots. Even experienced workers struggle to get a human conversation. The result is a tough, impersonal job market where the real hiring happens to those who can beat the algorithms. That's the story."
