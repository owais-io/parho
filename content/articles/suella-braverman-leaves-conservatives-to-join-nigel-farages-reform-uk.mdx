title: "Suella Braverman Leaves Conservatives to Join Nigel Farage’s Reform UK"
summary: "Suella Braverman, a former Home Secretary who was shuffled out of the Cabinet twice, joined Nigel Farage’s Reform UK during a London rally. The move was planned but not widely known, giving the new party a high‑profile figure with Whitehall experience. However, Braverman’s past scandals could hurt Reform’s credibility, and Farage must balance her influence with the need to broaden his support beyond the party’s core voters. Reform now has eight MPs, many former Conservatives."
