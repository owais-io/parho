title: "Australian Super Fund Accused of Greenwashing After Cutting Green Investment Standards"
summary: "UniSuper, an Australian pension fund that manages $158 bn for 670,000 members, is being called out for greenwashing. The fund’s “Global Environmental Opportunities” option was marketed as sustainable, but in March 2025 it lowered its green criteria from 40 % to 20 %. The change lets tech giants like Microsoft and Nvidia in, which may not meet strict environmental standards. A member’s complaint to ASIC claims the fund misled investors by keeping the “sustainable” label and not explaining the shift."
