title: "Tony Blair’s Legacy: Breaking Labour’s Unity"
summary: "In this letter, David Hallam, a former Labour MEP, recalls how Tony Blair reshaped the Labour Party. Hallam argues Blair turned the party from a broad, inclusive coalition into a tightly controlled group that frowned on dissent. He notes Blair’s influence forced other politicians out and even created space for right‑wing groups like UKIP. Hallam compares Blair’s tactics to those later used by Jeremy Corbyn, warning that the party’s unity has been severely damaged."
