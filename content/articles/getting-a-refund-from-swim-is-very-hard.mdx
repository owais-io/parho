title: "Getting a Refund from Swim! Is Very Hard"
summary: "Parents of kids at Swim! – a swim school run by Olympians – say it’s hard to get refunds when lessons are cancelled. The company doesn’t warn that parents must fill a refund form within 30 days, so many end up paying for lessons that never happened. Online reviews are full of complaints, and a consumer lawyer says this could be unfair. Swim! says it’ll improve communication but hasn’t answered every letter."
