title: "Victoria Quickly Changes Housing Rules to Help Millennials Buy Homes"
summary: "Victoria has changed housing rules in two years to help young people own homes. The government set targets for local councils, opened up lots around train stations, and made a fast‑track townhouse code. The changes were led by the YIMBY movement, which pushes for more homes in suburbs. Some residents and planners worry about how fast the rules are made and whether new homes will meet local needs. Costs are rising, and a foreign buyer tax may stop overseas investment."
