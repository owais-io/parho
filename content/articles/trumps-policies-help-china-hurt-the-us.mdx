title: "Trump’s Policies Help China, Hurt the U.S."
summary: "Trump’s America‑First agenda has actually helped China grow stronger while hurting the United States. His trade war backfired, forcing China to push back and the U.S. to lower tariffs. He sold advanced AI chips to China and weakened U.S. research, while allies like Canada and Europe grew wary and sought new ties with Beijing. The result is a weaker U.S. standing worldwide and a rising China."
