title: "People still in unsafe supported housing two years after new law"
summary: "The 2023 Supported Housing Act should stop landlords using empty homes to make money from housing benefit, but the rules to enforce it haven’t been rolled out yet. That means people who need support—like ex‑prisoners, drug users, domestic‑violence survivors, and those with mental health problems—are still stuck in unsafe, overcrowded house‑shares. Reports say there’s mice, mould, abuse and even deaths. Local councils lack data and are trying to step in, but critics fear the delay lets bad landlords keep going."
