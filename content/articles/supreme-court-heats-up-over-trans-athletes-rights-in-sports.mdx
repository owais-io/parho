title: "Supreme Court Heats Up Over Trans Athletes’ Rights in Sports"
summary: "The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments about state laws that ban transgender girls from girls’ sports teams. Two cases—one from Idaho, one from West Virginia—challenge laws that forbid trans students from participating. If the Court sides with the bans, it could weaken protections for trans and LGBTQ+ youth, affecting things like bathroom use and name rights. Supporters say the bans keep competition fair, while advocates argue they’re unfair and hurt young people."
