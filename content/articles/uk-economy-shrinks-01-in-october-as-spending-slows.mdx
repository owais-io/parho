title: "UK Economy Shrinks 0.1% in October as Spending Slows"
summary: "UK economy fell 0.1% in October, the Office for National Statistics said, after a 0.1% dip in September. The drop was mainly from a weak services sector, with fewer car sales, retail shopping and tech work. Companies and shoppers were holding back because they were waiting for the chancellor’s budget. The hit was hit hardest in manufacturing and construction, and a cyber‑attack on Jaguar Land Rover stalled car production. The Bank of England may lower rates to help growth."
