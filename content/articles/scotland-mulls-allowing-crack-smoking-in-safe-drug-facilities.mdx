title: "Scotland Mulls Allowing Crack Smoking in Safe Drug Facilities"
summary: "Scottish ministers are looking at changing the ban on smoking in public places so that people who use crack cocaine can do so in supervised drug‑use centres in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Health officials say more people are switching from injecting heroin to smoking crack, which can be safer but still needs support. The government wants to add ventilated booths to existing “clean‑room” facilities, but legal and policing issues still need to be sorted."
