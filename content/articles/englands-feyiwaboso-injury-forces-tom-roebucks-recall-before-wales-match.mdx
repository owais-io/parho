title: "England’s Feyi‑Waboso Injury Forces Tom Roebuck’s Recall Before Wales Match"
summary: "England’s wing, Immanuel Feyi‑Waboso, pulled a hamstring in training and is out of the Six Nations opener against Wales. The injury forced coach Steve Borthwick to bring back Tom Roebuck, who hasn't played since a toe injury, to fill the slot. Borthwick still doubts whether Feyi‑Waboso will recover in time. England, however, remain favorites for a long winning streak, despite the squad shake‑up."
