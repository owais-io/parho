title: "Judge Blocks Minnesota Arrests of Lawful Refugees"
summary: "A federal judge in Minnesota has stopped the Trump administration's plan to arrest and detain refugees who have been in the country for more than a year but haven’t yet become permanent residents. The court said the law does not give immigration officials that power and called the policy “unconstitutional.” The ruling protects people who are already allowed to stay in the U.S. and had no removal or flight‑risk charges."
