title: "Building with Bamboo: A Low‑Carbon Alternative"
summary: "Engineers are pushing for bamboo to replace steel and concrete in buildings. A new guide from the Institution of Structural Engineers helps designers use bamboo safely, aiming to cut construction’s carbon emissions. Bamboo already shows up in airports, high‑rise towers, schools, and earthquake‑resistant homes around the world. It grows fast, needs few chemicals, and can store carbon, making it a promising eco‑friendly building material."
