title: "Climbing a Quarry That Keeps Changing"
summary: "After three years, the author returns to Neath Abbey Quarry in South Wales, finding the path altered and tree stumps replaced by mulch. He and a friend tackle the rocks with oversized climbing pads, catching early birds in a berry‑laden holly thicket. The quarry has a layered past: monks built an abbey, miners quarried stone, climbers carved routes, and a flood reshaped the cliff. Today the rocks are covered in moss and old bolts, and the writer wonders how the place will look next."
