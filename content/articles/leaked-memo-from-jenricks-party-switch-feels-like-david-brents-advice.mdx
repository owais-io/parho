summary: "Robert Jenrick, a former Conservative cabinet minister, left the party for Reform UK. Over the weekend, aides leaked a six‑page memo that tells him how to answer tough questions from the press. The advice is oddly similar to the clueless, self‑deluded style of David Brent from the UK version of *The Office*. Readers are asked to decide whether the lines come from Jenrick’s team or the fictional manager."
