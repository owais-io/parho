title: "Trump pardon sparks fear for Honduran environmental defenders"
summary: "In December, former U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, a former Honduran leader convicted of drug trafficking and human‑rights abuse. The move alarmed environmental activists who had seen Hernández’s trial as proof that powerful men could be held accountable. The pardon is seen as a boost to impunity in Honduras, a country already notorious for violence against defenders. It could make communities fighting for forests and water even more vulnerable."
