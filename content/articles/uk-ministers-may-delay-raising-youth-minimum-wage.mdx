title: "UK Ministers May Delay Raising Youth Minimum Wage"
summary: "Ministers might hold off on increasing the minimum wage for 18‑ to 20‑year‑olds, citing worries that the jump could drive up youth unemployment. Labour promised equalising pay rates by the next election, but a slower rise is being considered. Current wages are £10 for younger workers and £12.21 for those over 21. Firms fear higher costs could curb hiring, while the union says jobs won’t be lost."
