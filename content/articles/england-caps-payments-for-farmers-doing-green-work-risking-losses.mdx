title: "England Caps Payments for Farmers Doing Green Work, Risking Losses"
summary: "England has introduced a cap of £100,000 a year on payments farmers can get for green projects, meaning many big farms may pull land back into food production. The policy aims to spread money to smaller farms, but farmers fear it will cut funding for long‑term conservation work. The change could halt projects that have been improving the countryside for years, sparking protests from the farming and environmental groups."
