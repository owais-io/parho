summary: "Pauline Hanson’s daughter, Lee Hanson, was hired as a senior adviser to New South Wales Senator Sean Bell. The job pays up to $180,000 a year and is funded by taxpayers. The appointment raised questions because MPs normally cannot hire immediate family members. One Nation has seen its staff budget cut, and critics say the move is a political favour.
