title: "Green Party Wins Gorton and Denton Byelection, Labour Falls to Third"
summary: "The Green Party won a historic byelection in Gorton and Denton, beating Labour and Reform UK. Hannah Spencer, a local plumber, captured almost 41% of the vote, a 4,400‑vote lead. Labour finished third, and the Conservatives lost their deposit. The result shows a growing shift away from Labour’s traditional voters and a weakening of the Labour‑Conservative duopoly. It also raises doubts about Labour’s future in Greater Manchester."
