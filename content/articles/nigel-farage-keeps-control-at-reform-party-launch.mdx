title: "Nigel Farage Keeps Control at Reform Party Launch"
summary: "After naming a new team, Nigel Farage keeps the reins of Reform’s public messaging. He opened a Reform Party event in Dover, delivering the introductory remarks and directing the Q&A. New spokesperson Zia Yusuf then gave a 30‑minute speech that pushed hard‑line immigration policies and was criticised for its hateful, divisive language. The piece shows how Farage still controls the party’s narrative while the new speech drew widespread condemnation."
