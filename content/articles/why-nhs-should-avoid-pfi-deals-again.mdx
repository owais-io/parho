title: "Why NHS Should Avoid PFI Deals Again"
summary: "A former architect says the NHS must stop using private finance initiatives (PFIs) for new hospitals. Research shows PFI projects have poor design, cheap materials, and break safety rules. Contractors, not architects, usually run these deals, leading to bad functionality and high long‑term costs. When the 25‑ to 30‑year contracts end, many buildings are left in poor shape and expensive to fix. The message is clear: PFIs don’t build good, cost‑effective public buildings, so they should be avoided."
