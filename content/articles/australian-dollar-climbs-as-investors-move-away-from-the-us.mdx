title: "Australian Dollar Climbs as Investors Move Away From the US"
summary: "Aussie money is climbing because investors are ditching US dollars after Trump’s erratic moves, like tariff threats and attacks on the Fed. The Australian dollar has risen above $0.68 against the US dollar, helped by strong commodity prices and a solid jobs market that hints at higher interest rates. While the US might cut rates, the AUD could keep rising, though global crises could reverse gains."
