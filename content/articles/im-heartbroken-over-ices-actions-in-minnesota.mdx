summary: "I write about how ICE’s actions in Minnesota make me feel hopeless. I reference disturbing photos of detained kids like Liam Ramos and remember Alan Kurdi’s story. I say we must find humanity again, not just numbers. The letters that follow show people from all walks of life—some repeating facts, others sharing quirky comments—yet all echo the same sorrow about our treatment of refugees."
