title: "Fed Independence: Why Bond Markets Must Stay Strong"
summary: "Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the DOJ subpoena about the central bank’s building repairs is a political attack. He wants the Fed to keep making rate decisions based on data, not politics. Markets only reacted a little – the dollar dipped slightly and Treasury sales were modest. If the Fed loses its independence, investors could lose confidence, causing the dollar to fall and borrowing costs to rise. Trump’s power over the Fed is limited, so Powell’s warning matters."
