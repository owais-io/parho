title: "Reform MP Danny Kruger says UK's sexual economy needs rules"
summary: "Danny Kruger, a Reform MP who left the Conservatives, says the UK has a “totally unregulated sexual economy”. He argues that the government should help families by changing the tax system so households file together and by encouraging more children. He also wants to roll back the 2022 no‑fault divorce rule, but says that may not be party policy. Kruger stresses that a pro‑family framework would bring people together."
