title: "US Plane Disguised as Civilian Aircraft in Caribbean Strike Sparks War Crime Claims"
summary: "A U.S. plane painted to look like a civilian aircraft was used to bomb a small boat in the Caribbean, killing 11 Venezuelans. The attack, carried out in September 2022, was part of a U.S. drug‑trafficking campaign. Lawyers and international‑law experts say using a fake civilian look is a war crime called perfidy. The U.S. military claims it follows rules, but many see the operation as illegal and a death‑squad‑style strike."
