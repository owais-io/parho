title: "Saving Rare Plants While Russia Advances"
summary: "Researchers in Uman’s Sofiyivka lab are fighting to keep a rare Ukrainian flower, Moehringia hypanica, alive. Only 80 seedlings have survived after power outages and the loss of key research sites in Crimea and Kherson, which are now occupied by Russia. The lab grows the plants in sterile conditions and plans to plant some outside their native range. Scientists are also documenting environmental damage as “ecocide” to hold Russia accountable after the war."
