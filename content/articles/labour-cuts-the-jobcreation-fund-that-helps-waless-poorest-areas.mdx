title: "Labour Cuts the Job‑Creation Fund That Helps Wales’s Poorest Areas"
summary: "Labour’s new budget cuts the UK shared‑prosperity fund by 40% and replaces it with smaller local‑growth funds, removing the extra help that boosted jobs in poorer regions. The party also stopped the assisted‑area system that gave special support to hard‑hit towns. The cuts mean less money for job‑creation and more pressure on local councils to spend on care instead, putting more pressure on residents."
