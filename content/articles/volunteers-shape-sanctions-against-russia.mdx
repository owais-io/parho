title: "Volunteers Shape Sanctions Against Russia"
summary: "A 22‑year‑old Ukrainian refugee named Olena Yurchenko and other volunteers searched for items Russia needs to keep fighting. They discovered that Russia depends on computer‑controlled machine tools, engine parts and lubricants, most of which come from the West. By pointing these out, groups like ESCU and DeKleptocracy helped the EU and U.S. put them on sanctions lists. The hit on these supplies has made it harder for Russia to keep making weapons, even though it hasn’t stopped the war."
