title: "Sudanese Volunteers Brave Danger to Deliver Life‑Saving Aid"
summary: "In Sudan’s brutal war, ordinary people have stepped up to give food and medical help through the Emergency Response Rooms (ERR). Volunteers like Amira, Jamal and Alsanosi risk being targeted by the RSF or the army, even being beaten or killed. They move quietly between frontlines to counsel survivors and deliver meals, covering 96 districts and helping over 29 million people. Despite their lifesaving work, they get very little aid, running out of funds soon, but the UK is pledging support."
