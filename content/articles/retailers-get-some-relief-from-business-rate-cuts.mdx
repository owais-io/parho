title: "Retailers Get Some Relief from Business Rate Cuts"
summary: "The new budget says business rates for shops, bars and leisure spots will go down permanently, but not as steeply as many feared. About 750,000 businesses will pay less, and smaller operators will get extra discounts. The government will also give billions in short‑term help for those whose bills still rise. Some big chains say the cuts will ease pressure, while others worry the higher rates on big sites could hurt jobs and local communities."
