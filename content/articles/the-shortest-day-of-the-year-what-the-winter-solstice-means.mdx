title: "The Shortest Day of the Year: What the Winter Solstice Means"
summary: "On December 21, the northern hemisphere has its shortest day and longest night, called the winter solstice. It happens because Earth’s north pole points farthest away from the Sun, so the Sun is lowest in the sky. People have celebrated it for ages, like Rome’s Saturnalia. In the Southern Hemisphere it’s the opposite—longest day and summer. Meteorological winter starts December 1, but after the solstice the days begin to lengthen again."
