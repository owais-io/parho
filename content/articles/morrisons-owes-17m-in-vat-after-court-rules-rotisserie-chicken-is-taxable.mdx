title: "Morrisons Owes £17m in VAT After Court Rules Rotisserie Chicken Is Taxable"
summary: "Morrisons must pay £17 million in VAT after a UK court ruled its rotisserie chickens are taxable. The company said the birds were sold cold or reheated, but the judge found they were still hot when sold and had foil bags labelled “hot product.” The ruling could push the price up from £4.40 to about £5.30, potentially cutting sales and hurting low‑income shoppers. The decision also stresses the need for clear tax rules."
