title: "Oxfam says the richest 1% have already used up their fair share of emissions for 2026"
summary: "Oxfam’s new study shows that the world’s richest 1% have already hit their allowed carbon emissions just 10 days into 2026, and the top 0.1% did so in only three days. The poorest 50% would need a whole year to reach the same level. The report warns that low‑income countries, Indigenous peoples, and women will suffer the worst climate damage. In the UK, the richest 1% produce as much pollution in eight days as the poorest half do in a year. Oxfam calls for higher taxes on the wealthiest and on polluting industries like private jets and oil companies, arguing that the richest must cut their emissions by 97% by 2030 to keep global warming below 1.5 °C."
