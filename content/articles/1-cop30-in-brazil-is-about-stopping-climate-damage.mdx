title: "1. COP30 in Brazil is about stopping climate damage."
summary: "2. Farmers and food companies are on the sidelines, trying to stop talks about food’s big emissions.   3. They want the meeting to focus on trade, money and how to keep things the same.   4. The food lobby says we only need more tech, not to cut farming or the big gas‑fuel industry.   5. They also want big money from rich countries for the poor, but those promises are not being met.   6. Trade disputes, especially the EU’s carbon tax on imports, upset many countries.   7. Transparency—countries showing real numbers—is tough because it looks like a loss of power.   8. Brazil hopes the talks finish with a clear plan to end coal, oil and big forests, but the details are still missing."
