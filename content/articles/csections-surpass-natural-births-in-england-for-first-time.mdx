title: "C‑sections surpass natural births in England for first time"
summary: "A new NHS survey shows that for the first time, more babies in England were born by caesarean section (C‑section) than by natural vaginal birth. In 2024‑25, C‑sections made up 45% of deliveries, just ahead of 44% vaginal births. Women under 30 still favour vaginal birth, but those 30 and older, especially over 40, mostly choose C‑sections. The rise is linked to older mothers, higher obesity and complex pregnancies. About 20% were planned and 25% emergency, record highs."
