title: "Coalition Can Hold Labor Accountable If It Stops Fighting Itself"
summary: "After the Coalition reunited, its main job is to question the Labor government. This week’s focus will be on the Israeli president’s visit, the Bondi terror attack, and the recent interest‑rate hike. Opponents want to ask about how the government handled the massacre and why a royal commission on antisemitism was delayed. They also plan to scrutinise spending, the FoI bill and gambling ads. Internal fights and a possible leadership challenge could threaten their unity."
