title: "London’s Young Muslims Build Inclusive Ramadan Spaces – But They’re at Risk"
summary: "Last year, London’s young Muslims organized a network of inclusive Ramadan events, from shared iftars to feminist prayers and wellness workshops. These community gatherings, held outside mosques in places like Shoreditch and Farringdon, offered a safe, diverse space amid rising Islamophobia. But this year the key venue, Ramadan Space, has pulled out, threatening the whole grassroots movement. The loss could weaken the city’s ability to bring people together and support those feeling isolated."
