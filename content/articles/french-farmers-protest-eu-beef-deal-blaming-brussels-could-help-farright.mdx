title: "French farmers protest EU beef deal, blaming Brussels – could help far‑right"
summary: "Farmers in France have blocked roads with tractors to protest the EU's new trade agreement with Mercosur, a group of South American countries. They fear cheap beef will hurt French producers, but experts say the deal brings benefits to other French sectors. President Macron has backed the farmers, sparing his minority government from a vote of no confidence. His move may give the far‑right National Rally more support, threatening the EU’s stability."
