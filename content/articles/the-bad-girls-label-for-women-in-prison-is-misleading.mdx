title: "The “bad girls” label for women in prison is misleading"
summary: "Most women in jail are not violent; they’re often jailed for things like shoplifting, debt or drug use driven by poverty, mental illness, or abuse. The story shows how prisons hurt families—women miss children, face sexual violence, and suffer more self‑harm. Yet international talks ignore this issue and funding is low. Some activists are pushing community sentences and support networks, hoping to cut the growing number of women behind bars and protect their children."
