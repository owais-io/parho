title: "Readers Share Quick Thoughts in Letters"
summary: "The Guardian’s quick letters section shows readers voicing opinions on everything from politics and sports to practical household hacks. One letter criticises the government’s competence, another notes a lack of Scottish rugby coverage, while others describe making a bed warmer or using a metal shelf as a hot‑water bottle. There are also comments about a 66‑year‑old prince’s pension and a personal thank‑you note. Readers are encouraged to submit their own letters."
