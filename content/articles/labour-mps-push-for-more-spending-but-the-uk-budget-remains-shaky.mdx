title: "Labour MPs push for more spending, but the UK budget remains shaky"
summary: "Labour MPs want the government to spend more, but the UK’s public finances are still weak. The spring budget will try to balance cautious spending with optimism about growth. Tax receipts hit a record in January thanks to one‑off capital‑gains sales, and inflation fell to 3 %, which could let the Bank cut rates. However, borrowing is still about £130 bn, close to 4.5 % of GDP, and big cuts are needed to keep the deficit down."
