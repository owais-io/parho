title: "Reform UK’s private health insurance tax break would cost £1.7bn"
summary: "Labour's health secretary Wes Streeting will warn that Reform UK's plan to give 20% tax relief on private health insurance would cost the country £1.7 billion. The proposal, announced in Reform's manifesto before the 2024 election, would let people pay less for private health plans and could push more patients away from the NHS. Streeting, speaking at a Fabian Society event, will argue the scheme mainly helps the rich and would undermine the public system."
