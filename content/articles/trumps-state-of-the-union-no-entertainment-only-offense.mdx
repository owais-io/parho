title: "Trump’s State of the Union: No Entertainment, Only Offense"
summary: "Trump gave a two‑hour State of the Union that was mostly jokes, false claims and political attacks, not policy. He talked about immigrants, trans kids and made untrue statements about healthcare, taxes and the economy. The speech was full of distractions and little new ideas. His tone was tired and he kept insulting opponents, leaving reporters wondering if the address was even useful."
