title: "DIY shops see big gains as UK house prices slow"
summary: "Retailers that sell home‑improvement items have posted record profits on the London market, thanks to a sluggish housing sector. With house prices flat and mortgages hard to afford, shoppers are fixing and decorating at home instead of buying or renovating. Companies like Kingfisher, Wickes, Topps Tiles and DFS are up 13–56% in share value this year. Meanwhile, building‑material suppliers lag, and higher unemployment could slow the DIY boom."
