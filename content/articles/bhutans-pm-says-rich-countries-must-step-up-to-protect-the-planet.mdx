summary: "Bhutan, the world's first carbon‑negative country, says the rich nations that caused most of the climate crisis must step up and cut their own emissions. The country, with 72% forest cover and a goal of 60% forest protection, has doubled its renewable energy and started projects like green hydrogen. It argues that improving people’s happiness, not just GDP, is possible while protecting the environment. Bhutan urges developed countries to fund and support adaptation for small, vulnerable states."
