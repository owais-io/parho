title: "Delete Instagram to Make Parenting Easier This Summer"
summary: "I was on a beach break, got into Instagram, and after an hour felt drained. Instagram is full of parenting hacks that promise to make us play more, be present, or look good, but they pull us into a never‑ending scrolling loop. I realized real parenting isn’t a game to optimize. The fix? Delete Instagram, put the phone away, and trust your gut. Then you can enjoy simple moments, like a child playing with a unicorn‑print pencil case, without pressure."
