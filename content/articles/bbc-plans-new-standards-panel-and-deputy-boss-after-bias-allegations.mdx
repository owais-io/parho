title: "BBC Plans New Standards Panel and Deputy Boss After Bias Allegations"
summary: "The BBC is changing how it looks at complaints about its coverage after a row over alleged bias. The broadcaster will create a new deputy director‑general post and enlarge the editorial‑guidelines panel so no single person dominates. This follows the sudden resignations of director Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness, and a whistle‑blower memo that critics say shows a pro‑right bias. Board members, including Robbie Gibb, face calls to step down, and MPs will question the situation next week."
