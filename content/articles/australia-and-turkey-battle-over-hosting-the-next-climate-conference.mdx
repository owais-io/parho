title: "Australia and Turkey Battle Over Hosting the Next Climate Conference"
summary: "At the COP30 meeting, Australia and Turkey are squabbling over who will host COP31 in 2026. Australia wants the conference in the Pacific, like Adelaide, to help island nations facing climate threats. Turkey insists on Antalya, a Mediterranean resort city. Neither side is backing each other, so the UN is worried the conference could default to Germany, the climate office’s host, if no agreement is reached."
