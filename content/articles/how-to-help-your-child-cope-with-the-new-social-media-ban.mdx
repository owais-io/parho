title: "How to Help Your Child Cope with the New Social Media Ban"
summary: "Many parents welcome the ban on social media for kids under 16, but it can leave teens feeling upset. Experts say the best help is to listen and stay in touch, not try to fix the problem. Talk openly about how the ban feels, suggest other ways to stay in contact (like WhatsApp or group chats), and keep communication easy, even during meals or walks. Set clear family tech rules, watch for mood changes, and share helpline numbers so kids know where to get help if they need it."
