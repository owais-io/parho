title: "More City Birds: My Son Helped Me Hear Them"
summary: "My teenage son pointed out that the city’s birds were louder this winter. I listened and identified sparrows, robins, pigeons, wrens, blue tits and long‑tailed tits, even the starling call. A book taught me to recognise their songs, so I could hear more even when they’re hidden in the streets. I’ve noticed some species missing, like goldfinches, and that only a few thrushes are singing. Still, the season is waking up and so are the birds."
