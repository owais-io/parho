title: "UK, UN, EU Call Jimmy Lai’s 20‑Year Hong Kong Prison Sentence a Huge Injustice"
summary: "The UK, the UN, the EU and human‑rights groups have said Jimmy Lai’s 20‑year jail sentence in Hong Kong is a massive injustice. Lai, a British‑born publisher who ran the pro‑democracy Apple Daily, was convicted under a national security law that critics say silences critics of China. Governments and lawyers say the trial was politically motivated and that Lai is the world’s most high‑profile political prisoner. They are calling for his immediate release."
