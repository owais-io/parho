title: "Assisted‑dying MPs threaten to override Lords if bill blocked"
summary: "A bill that would let terminally ill people end their lives with medical help is stuck in the House of Lords. Labour MPs Kim Leadbeater and Charles Falconer said they would use the Parliament Act to force the bill through if peers keep blocking it, calling the Lords' action “bullying”. The government has stayed neutral but won’t promise extra time. Opponents worry the law would let poverty or mental illness justify death."
