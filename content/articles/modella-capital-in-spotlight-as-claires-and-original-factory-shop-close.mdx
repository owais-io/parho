title: "Modella Capital in Spotlight as Claire’s and Original Factory Shop Close"
summary: "Modella Capital, a small UK investment firm, has bought several struggling high‑street chains, including Claire’s, The Original Factory Shop, Hobbycraft and WH Smith. It quickly closed stores and cut rents, but the collapse of Claire’s and the factory shop threatens 2,550 jobs and could shut all 154 and 140 shops. The firm has made money from selling stock but is still looking for new deals. Rising rents, weak consumer confidence and online rivals are driving the crisis."
