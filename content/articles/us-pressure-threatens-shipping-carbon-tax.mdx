title: "US Pressure Threatens Shipping Carbon Tax"
summary: "The US has used threats against small nations to try to stop a proposed carbon tax on ships. Panama, after a leaked paper from the US, decided to back out of the levy that would have charged ships for their emissions. The tax would have raised billions for climate action, but the US’s pressure has pushed several countries to abandon it, undermining efforts to cut shipping’s 3 % share of global carbon."
