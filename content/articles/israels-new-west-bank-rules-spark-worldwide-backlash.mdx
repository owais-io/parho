title: "Israel’s new West Bank rules spark worldwide backlash"
summary: "Israel has introduced new rules that extend its control over the West Bank, letting non‑Arabs buy land and shifting building permits from Palestinian to Israeli authorities. The move was meant to strengthen Israeli settlements and block a future Palestinian state. Countries across the world, from the EU to Arab states, and the UK and Australia, have condemned the decision, warning it could spark more violence. The U.S. says it does not support annexation and has expressed opposition to the plan."
