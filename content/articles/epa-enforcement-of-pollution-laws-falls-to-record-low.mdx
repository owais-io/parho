summary: "A new study of EPA records shows that the agency has barely taken action against big polluters during the last year of the Trump administration. Only one Clean Air Act case was filed, down from 26 in 2018 and 22 under Biden. The agency also pushed back on Superfund and Clean Water Act cases, dropping to just seven and four.
