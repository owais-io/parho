title: "Trump’s “Peace Board” Is a One‑Man Power Club That Could Replace the UN"
summary: "At the UN, member states passed a resolution they thought would give Trump a temporary role in a Gaza cease‑fire. Instead, they backed a new “board of peace” that is basically a Trump‑run club. The charter gives Trump total control, lets him pick or fire members, and even offers $1 billion life‑memberships. The board claims it will help peace and rebuild Gaza, but its rules look aimed at displacing the UN and putting power into Trump’s hands."
