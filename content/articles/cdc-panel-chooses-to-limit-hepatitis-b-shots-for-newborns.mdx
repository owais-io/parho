title: "CDC Panel Chooses to Limit Hepatitis B Shots for Newborns"
summary: "The CDC’s vaccine experts voted to stop the recommendation that every baby gets a hepatitis B shot at birth. Instead, parents of babies whose mothers test negative will decide with a doctor whether to give the vaccine, and the first dose could be delayed to two months. Critics warn this change could lead to more infections, cancers, and deaths, hurt low‑income families who rely on free vaccines. The new advice may create confusion and harder access to the vaccine."
