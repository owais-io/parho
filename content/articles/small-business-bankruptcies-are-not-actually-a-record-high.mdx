title: "Small Business Bankruptcies Are Not Actually a Record High"
summary: "The headline says small‑business bankruptcies hit a record, but the numbers tell a different story. In 2024, just 2,221 small‑business filings under Subchapter V were filed—10 fewer than the 2,231 in 2025—and that’s only about 0.01% of the 33 million U.S. small firms. Even the total bankruptcy count rose 25% under Biden, still far below 2009‑2019 levels. Most small shops close quietly without filing, so the “record high” label is misleading."
