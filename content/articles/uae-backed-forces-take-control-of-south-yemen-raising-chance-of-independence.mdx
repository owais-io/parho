title: "UAE-backed forces take control of South Yemen, raising chance of independence"
summary: "UAE-backed forces led by the Southern Transitional Council (STC) have taken control of all eight southern governorates in Yemen, including the oil‑rich Hadramaut. Saudi troops pulled out of Aden and the airport, while Oman briefly shut the border. The STC could now push for a separate Yemen, but doing so would be risky, as other break‑away regions have lost support. The move depends on the UAE’s decisions and could shift the balance between the UAE and Saudi Arabia."
