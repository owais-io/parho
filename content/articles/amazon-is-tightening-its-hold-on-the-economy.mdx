title: "Amazon Is Tightening Its Hold on the Economy"
summary: "Yanis Varoufakis says Amazon is turning our free‑market world into a new form of feudalism, where the company collects huge fees from everyone. He compares it to old traders who used state power to control prices. But the article argues Amazon still relies on workers' labour to sell goods. Rather than a new system, it shows capitalism getting stronger, squeezing workers harder. The real issue is capitalism’s growing grip on life."
