title: "Queensland Wants Olympic Rowing on Fitzroy River, Despite Crocodile Concerns"
summary: "Queensland officials want the 2032 Olympic rowing event to be held on the Fitzroy River in Rockhampton, even though the river hosts saltwater crocodiles and may not meet strict racing standards. They say they can decide the venue unless the International Olympic Committee insists otherwise. Rowing Australia and World Rowing have not confirmed the river meets technical criteria yet. Some experts think this is political bluffing that could force the event elsewhere."
