title: "Davos Turns into Trump Show as Global Leaders Fight His Tariff Threats"
summary: "The 47th Davos week was hijacked by Donald Trump’s visit. Leaders like Canada’s Mark Carney and the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen spoke out against Trump’s tariff threats and his plan to seize Greenland, urging European unity. Trump’s speech, full of anger and racism, sparked fear among CEOs and politicians. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s war was pushed lower on the agenda, and EU trade talks stalled. The meeting turned into a Trump show rather than a policy forum."
