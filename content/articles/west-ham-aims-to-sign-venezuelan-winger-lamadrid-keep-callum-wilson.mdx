title: "West Ham Aims to Sign Venezuelan Winger Lamadrid, Keep Callum Wilson"
summary: "West Ham are trying to sign Venezuelan winger Keiber Lamadrid while keeping striker Callum Wilson, who scored a late winner against Tottenham. The club, five points from safety, wants Wilson back after he’d been looking for a new club. New arrivals Taty Castellanos and Pablo Felipe have bolstered the squad, and Lamadrid would add left‑wing firepower. They still need to sort out the future of Brazilian midfielder Lucas Paquetá, who may leave for Flamengo. West Ham hopes to keep their attacking options strong before the winter break."
