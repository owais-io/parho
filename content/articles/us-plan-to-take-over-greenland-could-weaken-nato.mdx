title: "US Plan to Take Over Greenland Could Weaken NATO"
summary: "Denmark worries that if the US attacked Greenland, a NATO country, the alliance’s promise of collective defence would fall apart. Article 5 says an attack on one member is an attack on all, but that rule is hard to apply when the most powerful member is the aggressor. The debate over defence spending, Trump’s comments, and a possible Greenland grab show how fragile NATO’s unity is and give Russia a chance to profit."
