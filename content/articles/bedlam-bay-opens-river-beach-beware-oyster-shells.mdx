title: "Bedlam Bay Opens River Beach – Beware Oyster Shells"
summary: "A new swimming spot opened on the Parramatta River at Bedlam Bay, thanks to a $560,000 state grant. The beach is near the old Tarban Creek asylum and has a pink flamingo float. The water is warm and a bit salty, and a net keeps out sharks. Visitors have to wade through leaves and avoid sharp oyster shells. The government plans better parking, signage and showers, and similar upgrades are happening at other river spots."
