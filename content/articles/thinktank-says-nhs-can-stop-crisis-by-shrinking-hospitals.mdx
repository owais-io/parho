title: "Thinktank says NHS can stop crisis by shrinking hospitals"
summary: "A thinktank called Re:State says the NHS can end its “permacrisis” if hospitals are made smaller and use fewer beds. The idea is to shift more care into people’s homes and local community centres, so fewer people need to stay in hospital. The plan could save billions, improve patient care, and ease staff workload. NHS leaders and politicians will have to make tough changes, but the government is already moving some services out of hospitals."
