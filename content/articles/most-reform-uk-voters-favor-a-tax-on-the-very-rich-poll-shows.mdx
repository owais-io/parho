title: "Most Reform UK voters favor a tax on the very rich, poll shows"
summary: "A recent poll of over 3,000 potential Reform UK voters shows that 61% would support a one‑off tax on people with more than £10 million in wealth, while 77% back a windfall tax on energy firms and 73% favour a tax on bank profits. This contrasts with leader Nigel Farage’s opposition. The results also find strong support for these taxes among Labour, Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Green voters, suggesting broad public approval and a chance for the Chancellor to act."
