title: "Trump Says Only His Morality Limits His Power"
summary: "Trump says he is only bound by his own morals, but courts have found him guilty of fraud, sexual abuse, defamation and misuse of charity money. He ignores rules when they get in the way and reacts by retaliation. Critics say this shows a lack of real restraint and that leaders need external laws to keep them in check. Some argue Europe should accept his decisive style, but others fear a move toward authoritarianism."
