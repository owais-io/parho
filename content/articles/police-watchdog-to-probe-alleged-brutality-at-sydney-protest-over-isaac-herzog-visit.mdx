title: "Police watchdog to probe alleged brutality at Sydney protest over Isaac Herzog visit"
summary: "A watchdog group called the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission will investigate reports of police brutality at a Sydney protest against Israel president Isaac Herzog’s visit. The probe will look at how officers used force, pepper‑spray and kettling, and whether they harmed protesters, including those praying. The investigation will review videos and documents, hold hearings, and produce a public report. The NSW premier has defended police, but opposition groups say an independent inquiry is essential for accountability."
