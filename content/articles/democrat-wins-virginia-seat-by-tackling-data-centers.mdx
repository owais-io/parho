title: "Democrat Wins Virginia Seat by Tackling Data Centers"
summary: "John McAuliff, a 33‑year‑old small‑business owner, won a Virginia state seat by focusing on how data centers raise electricity bills. He walked door‑to‑door in a suburban‑rural district that hadn’t elected a Democrat in years, talking to voters about power costs and keeping local farmland. He beat Republican incumbent Geary Higgins in a tight race, spending almost $3 million. His win helped Democrats gain control of Virginia’s government. The race was one of the most expensive in the state."
