title: "New Blood Test Could Spot Those Most at Risk From Common Genetic Heart Disease"
summary: "Scientists have made a simple blood test that could tell which people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)—the most common inherited heart condition—are most likely to have serious problems. The test looks for a protein called NT‑Pro‑BNP, which rises when the heart works too hard. In a study of 700 patients, those with the highest levels had worse heart function and scar tissue. Knowing this risk early could help doctors give the right treatment and spare people from unnecessary medicines."
