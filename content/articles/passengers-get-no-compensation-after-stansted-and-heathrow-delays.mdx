title: "Passengers get no compensation after Stansted and Heathrow delays"
summary: "Passengers caught in delayed flights at Stansted and Heathrow because of a fire and traffic‑light software glitch. They missed flights, paid extra for taxis and had to rebook, but both the airline and the airport refused to pay compensation. UK law only covers airlines, leaving passengers without a remedy, says a consumer‑rights lawyer. Travel insurance may help, but its terms are often restrictive for unexpected delays."
