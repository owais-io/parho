title: "Use Buy‑Now, Pay‑Later Wisely to Avoid Debt"
summary: "Buy‑Now, Pay‑Later (BNPL) lets you split big purchases into three or four interest‑free payments. It’s popular, but many people miss a payment and face fees or debt. Regulators will start controlling BNPL on July 15, requiring lenders to check affordability and give clear terms. Until then, use it only if you can pay each instalment on time, compare with zero‑interest credit cards, and keep a schedule to avoid surprises."
