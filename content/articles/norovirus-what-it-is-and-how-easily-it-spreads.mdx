title: "Norovirus: What It Is and How Easily It Spreads"
summary: "Norovirus infects about 684 million people a year, causing sudden vomiting and watery diarrhea. A tiny dose—less than 20 particles—can make you sick, and the virus stays on hard surfaces for up to two weeks. It spreads mainly through the fecal‑oral route, and people are contagious even before symptoms appear. Kids, the elderly, and immunocompromised are at higher risk. No vaccine exists, so clean with bleach, wash hands thoroughly, and stay hydrated. If you can’t keep fluids down, seek medical help."
