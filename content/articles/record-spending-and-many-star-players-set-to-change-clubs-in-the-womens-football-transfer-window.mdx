title: "Record spending and many star players set to change clubs in the women’s football transfer window"
summary: "Women's football is spending more than ever, with $12.3 million spent in the summer of 2025 – almost twice last year. The winter window (2 January–3 February) already saw Germany’s Lea Schüller and Norway’s Signe Gaupset sign with WSL clubs. Many star players, like Khadija Shaw, Sam Kerr, and others, have contracts ending this summer, so clubs like Liverpool and West Ham must act fast. With no big tournaments next year, transfers are driven mainly by player contracts and club needs."
