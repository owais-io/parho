title: "Trump’s Venezuela raid could hurt U.S. economic strength"
summary: "Trump used the U.S. military to seize control of Venezuela’s oil reserves, a move that echoes old colonial looting. He claims it’s for Venezuelans, but the real goal is to benefit U.S. fossil‑fuel companies. This aggressive strategy sets a dangerous precedent and weakens U.S. rules of law. Meanwhile, U.S. manufacturing jobs keep falling, China is advancing in green tech, and the U.S. may end up losing economic ground."
