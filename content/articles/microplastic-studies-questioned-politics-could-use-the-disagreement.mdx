title: "Microplastic Studies Questioned; Politics Could Use the Disagreement"
summary: "Twenty recent studies that measured micro‑ and nanoplastics in people’s bodies have been criticized for faulty methods, especially the main technique used. Scientists say the problem could affect many high‑impact papers, suggesting a systemic issue. In a climate where science trust is already under attack, these disputes risk becoming tools for political doubt. Better standards, wider peer review, and cautious reporting are urged before new results reach the media."
