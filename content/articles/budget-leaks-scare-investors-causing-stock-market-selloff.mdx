title: "Budget leaks scare investors, causing stock market sell‑off"
summary: "Last month’s leaks about the UK budget sent investors scrambling. They dumped £3.02 billion from equity funds, the second‑worst month on record, as worries about pension and tax changes grew. The panic stopped once the budget was announced, and new money flowed back in. Meanwhile Ofgem approved a £28 billion upgrade of the electricity grid, a move the government says will reduce long‑term bills, though customers may see a short‑term rise. Greenpeace says the money must be spent wisely."
