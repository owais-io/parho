title: "SEND Reforms: Ministers Must Deliver on Inclusion"
summary: "The UK government’s new white paper on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) aims to raise standards and promote inclusion. It sets targets for attendance, halves the achievement gap, and allocates £1.8 bn to rebuild local services. Success hinges on Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson backing the reforms with real money and staff, tightening criteria for EHCPs, and ensuring new support plans are robust. Critics worry about tougher rules, reduced tribunal access and private‑sector reliance."
