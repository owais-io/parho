title: "I’m an American, but I’d skip visiting the US if I only had an Australian passport"
summary: "I’m a dual US‑Australian citizen who just visited the US for Thanksgiving. My passport let me skip the long lines, but I’ve heard Trump’s new visa rules could force travellers from 42 countries—including Australia—to hand over five years of social media, emails and family info. I’ve seen the US grow more divided, with big military spending and limits on rights. Because of these changes, I’d rather tour a more welcoming country than the US."
