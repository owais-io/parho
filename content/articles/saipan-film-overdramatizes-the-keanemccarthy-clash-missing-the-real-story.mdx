title: "Saipan film over‑dramatizes the Keane‑McCarthy clash, missing the real story"
summary: "Saipan is a film about the 2002 row between footballer Roy Keane and manager Mick McCarthy. The reviewer says the makers copy the uniforms and shots exactly, but they twist the story. Keane’s angry rant is shown as a national argument about Irishness, even though he never said that. The actors are the wrong ages and heights, making the drama look like bullying. The movie drops the real debate about Ireland’s future, leaving a shallow, inaccurate drama."
