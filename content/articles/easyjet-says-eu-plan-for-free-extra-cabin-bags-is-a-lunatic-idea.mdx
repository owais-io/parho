title: "EasyJet says EU plan for free extra cabin bags is a ‘lunatic idea’"
summary: "EU lawmakers want to let passengers carry an extra free hand‑bag on European flights. EasyJet’s boss says that would be crazy, crowd the cabin, slow boarding and push costs onto ticket prices. The airline makes a lot from bag fees, so any rule that lets people bring more for free would raise fares. The proposal still needs EU Council approval."
