title: "Huge spill of toxic plastic beads on Camber Sands beach"
summary: "Camber Sands beach in East Sussex had a huge spill of plastic beads called bio‑beads after a mechanical failure at Southern Water’s plant. The beads are plastic, can be eaten by birds and fish, break down into micro‑plastics, and may carry heavy metals and toxins. The spill threatens wildlife and could keep harming the area for years. Volunteers are cleaning, and companies are looking at safer alternatives like glass or coconut‑shell filters."
