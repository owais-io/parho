title: "Meta bans dozens of abortion and LGBTQ+ groups worldwide"
summary: "Meta has taken down or limited more than 50 accounts from abortion help sites, queer groups and other health organisations on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Critics say this is the biggest censorship wave in years and echoes a U.S.‑style crackdown on women’s health. Meta says its rules haven’t changed and that the bans were mistakes, but the appeals process is slow and some groups have been left without reliable info."
