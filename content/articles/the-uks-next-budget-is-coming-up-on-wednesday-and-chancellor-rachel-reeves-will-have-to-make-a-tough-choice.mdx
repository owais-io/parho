title: "The UK’s next budget is coming up on Wednesday, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves will have to make a tough choice."
summary: "She needs to keep the government’s debt under control, but her “fiscal rules” give her only about £10 billion of spare money, and that has been eaten away by higher borrowing costs and reversed welfare cuts.   So she’s likely to raise a few different taxes – freezing the income‑tax limits, tightening salary‑sacrifice rules, and possibly adding a tax on big houses – to give the government a little extra breathing room. At the same time, she must keep the bond market calm.   If traders think the UK will have to borrow more, gilt yields will rise, making interest payments more expensive and pushing the pound down.   If she can show the markets that the budget will stay balanced and give businesses a fair chance, gilt yields could stay low and the pound could bounce. The day’s agenda is simple:   ‑ 12:30 pm GMT – Reeves presents the budget.   ‑ 1:30 pm GMT – the Office for Budget Responsibility releases its forecast.   ‑ 2:30 pm GMT – a press conference about the budget.   Watch the market reaction – it could decide how well the new government will be seen."
