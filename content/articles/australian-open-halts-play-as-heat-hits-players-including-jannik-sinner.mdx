title: "Australian Open Halts Play as Heat Hits Players, Including Jannik Sinner"
summary: "The Australian Open had to pause play on Saturday because temperatures climbed to nearly 40 °C. A heat‑stress scale triggered a 10‑minute break after the third set and then shut the roofs on the main arenas, stopping all outer‑court matches. Jannik Sinner, who was sweating badly against Eliot Spizzirri, used the break, broke back, and won in four sets. The heat also slowed crowds and prompted water misters and free sunscreen."
