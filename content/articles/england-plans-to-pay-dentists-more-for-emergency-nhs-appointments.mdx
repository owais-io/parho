title: "England plans to pay dentists more for emergency NHS appointments"
summary: "The UK government will raise dentists' fees for urgent NHS appointments from April 2025, hoping to make emergency care easier to get. The new package gives dentists a standard payment for urgent and complex treatments, possibly saving patients about £225. But the British Dental Association says the changes add no real money and only tweak a broken system. Healthwatch warns the plan may still fall short without full, long‑term reform."
