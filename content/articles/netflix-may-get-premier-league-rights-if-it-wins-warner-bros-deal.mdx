title: "Netflix May Get Premier League Rights If It Wins Warner Bros Deal"
summary: "Netflix has been eyeing the Premier League for a long time, but hasn't paid for it. The company is in a big bidding war with Paramount to buy Warner Bros Discovery. That deal includes TNT Sports UK, which holds the Premier League’s TV rights until 2029. If Netflix wins, it could take over those rights without bidding again. The move would change how people watch football, but the final outcome is still unclear."
