title: "Buying Knighthoods: From Past Scams to Today’s ‘Honour’ Agents"
summary: "Every year the UK announces its New Year Honours. Decades ago, people could buy titles from a shady businessman named Arthur Maundy Gregory, who sold knighthoods, baronetcies and peerages for tens of thousands of pounds. The scheme was so corrupt that a law was passed in 1924, and Gregory was imprisoned. Today, some firms claim to help ordinary people get MBEs, OBEs or knighthoods for a fee, raising fresh doubts about whether honours are still earned or sold."
