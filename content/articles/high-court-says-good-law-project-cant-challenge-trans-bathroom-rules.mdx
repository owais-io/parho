title: "High Court Says Good Law Project Can't Challenge Trans Bathroom Rules"
summary: "The High Court ruled that the Good Law Project doesn’t have the legal right to oppose the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s interim advice that would have barred transgender people from using bathrooms matching their gender. The judge said letting a trans woman use a female toilet isn’t discrimination, and the interim advice was rushed and flawed. The decision supports the EHRC’s stance but leaves many questions about how the Supreme Court ruling will be applied. The Good Law Project plans to appeal."
