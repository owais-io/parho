title: "UK regulator gets complaints after GB News linked crime to “foreign‑sounding” names"
summary: "GB News aired a clip that claimed a high proportion of court defendants had “foreign‑sounding” names and linked this to sex‑offence charges. The data, taken from court rosters and counted by a solicitor, is not scientifically reliable and was criticised as racist. The Liberal Democrats and others filed complaints with Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator, which is now reviewing whether the channel breached broadcasting rules. The segment was presented by Martin Daubney."
