title: "Nationwide fined £44m for Covid fraud case"
summary: "Nationwide was fined £44m by the FCA for weak financial‑crime controls that let a customer fraudulently claim £27.3m in Covid furlough payments. Over five years the bank failed to spot the abuse because it didn't offer business accounts and lacked monitoring. HMRC has recovered most of the money, but £800,000 remains lost to taxpayers. Nationwide says it has fixed the problems and is tightening its systems."
