title: "Undercover Officer Pretended to Be Partner, Shows ‘Sadistic Tendencies’, Inquiry Finds"
summary: "A police spy, Mark Jenner, tricked activist Alison into a five‑year relationship while undercover. He pretended to be a normal partner, moved in with her, and even went on holiday with her, all while spying on left‑wing campaigns. When Alison asked about having children, he said he wasn’t ready and later staged a nervous breakdown to leave. The inquiry says his actions were “sadistic” and that about 50 women were similarly deceived over decades."
