title: "Mediterranean Diet Cuts Stroke Risk by Up to 25% in Women, Study Finds"
summary: "Researchers followed 105,000 women in California for 21 years, scoring how closely they followed a Mediterranean diet. Those with the highest scores had 18% lower overall stroke risk, 16% lower for ischemic strokes and a 25% lower risk of hemorrhagic strokes. The study shows diet could help prevent the most common and severe types of stroke, though it only included women and relied on self‑reported eating habits."
