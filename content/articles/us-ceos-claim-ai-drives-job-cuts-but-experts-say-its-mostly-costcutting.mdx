title: "US CEOs Claim AI Drives Job Cuts, but Experts Say It’s Mostly Cost‑Cutting"
summary: "Many U.S. CEOs blame artificial intelligence for cutting jobs, saying AI makes workers redundant. Analysts say the real reasons are usually tariffs, over‑hiring during the pandemic, or profit cuts, not technology. Studies show only a few percent of roles could be automated by 2030. Some firms admit AI helps but the layoffs are still mainly for cost savings, not tech progress."
