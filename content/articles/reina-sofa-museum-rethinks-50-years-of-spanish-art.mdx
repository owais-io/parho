summary: "The Reina Sofía in Madrid has opened a new gallery that shows 403 artworks from 1975 to today, marking Spain’s shift from Franco’s dictatorship to democracy. The collection mixes Spanish and international artists and tackles topics like the AIDS crisis, feminism, environmental issues, and the post‑Franco cultural boom.
