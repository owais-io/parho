title: "Democrats Likely to Reject ICE Funding Bill"
summary: "A large majority of House Democrats and the 213‑member caucus plan to vote against a bill that would fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). They are upset over ICE’s actions in Minnesota, where an agent shot Renee Good, and fear the agency’s unchecked power. Some say passing the bill could avoid a government shutdown that would hurt TSA, FEMA, and the Coast Guard. The bill also keeps ICE funded with $75 billion from a larger package."
