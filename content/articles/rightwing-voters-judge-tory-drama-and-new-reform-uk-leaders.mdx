title: "Right‑wing voters judge Tory drama and new Reform UK leaders"
summary: "Focus groups in Warrington South and Godalming & Ash asked voters about recent Conservative Party drama. Most liked Kemi Badenoch’s move to sack Robert Jenrick but still see the party as chaotic. Opinions on Reform UK’s new leaders were mixed: some favor Nigel Farage, others worry about his ties to Donald Trump. Many voters feel the country is broken and are tempted to try a right‑wing alternative."
