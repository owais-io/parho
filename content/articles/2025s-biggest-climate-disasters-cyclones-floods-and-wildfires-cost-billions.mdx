summary: "In 2025, severe storms, floods and fires caused over $120 billion in insured losses worldwide. A cyclone and flood wave in Southeast Asia killed more than 1,750 people and damaged buildings worth $25 billion, while California wildfires claimed 400 lives and cost $60 billion. China’s floods cost about $12 billion and displaced thousands.
