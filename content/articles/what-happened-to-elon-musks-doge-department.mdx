title: "What Happened to Elon Musk’s Doge Department?"
summary: "Elon Musk set up a special unit called Doge to slash federal waste, but the agency hasn’t delivered the promised $2 trillion savings. It has fired thousands, cut USAID funding, and caused global aid disruptions, while many lawsuits demand more transparency. The numbers it publishes are unreliable, and the agency’s structure is still murky. In short, Doge’s impact is unclear and largely unaccounted for."
