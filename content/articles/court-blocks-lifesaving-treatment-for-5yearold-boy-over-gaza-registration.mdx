title: "Court blocks life‑saving treatment for 5‑year‑old boy over Gaza registration"
summary: "The Jerusalem court refused to let a 5‑year‑old Palestinian boy with aggressive cancer travel from Ramallah to a Tel Aviv hospital for a bone‑marrow transplant, citing Israel’s rule that bars anyone registered in Gaza from entering the country after Oct. 7, even if they no longer live there. Doctors say the boy urgently needs therapy not available locally. Human‑rights groups call the blanket ban cruel, and many other patients are still trapped."
