title: "Arteta wants Arsenal strikers to score 20 goals and backs Viktor Gyökeres"
summary: "Arteta wants each Arsenal striker to score over 20 goals this season and he backs Viktor Gyökeres to reach that mark. Gyökeres has five league goals but hasn't scored from open play since November. No Arsenal player has hit 20 since Aubameyang in 2020, so the club hopes to set a record if they win the title. Arteta says the team’s goals should be spread, not rely on one player."
