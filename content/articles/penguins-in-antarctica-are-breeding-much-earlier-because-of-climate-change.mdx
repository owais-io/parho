title: "Penguins in Antarctica Are Breeding Much Earlier Because of Climate Change"
summary: "Penguins in Antarctica have moved their breeding season forward up to three weeks, a decade‑long study shows. Scientists used 77 cameras at 37 colonies to record when penguins settle. All three species—Adélie, chinstrap, and gentoo—started breeding earlier, with gentoo advancing by an average of 13 days. The shift could mean chicks hatch when food isn’t yet available, threatening survival and increasing competition among species."
