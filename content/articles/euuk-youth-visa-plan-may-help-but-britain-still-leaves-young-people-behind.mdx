title: "EU‑UK Youth Visa Plan May Help, but Britain Still Leaves Young People Behind"
summary: "The UK has launched a £500 m youth plan, yet many feel politicians ignore their problems. Rising tuition fees, low wages and Brexit have pushed young people to leave. A trade group proposes a limited EU‑UK youth visa scheme for up to 44,000 young people, letting them stay longer. Some MPs oppose it, but 72% of Britons support the idea, showing the country still needs to treat its younger generation better."
