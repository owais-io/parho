title: "Kind Strangers Still Make a Difference"
summary: "People shared short stories of how strangers helped them. One woman was saved after breaking her leg on Christmas Eve and got quick help from shop staff and paramedics. Another woman’s lost wallet was found and returned, sometimes with money missing or changed. A man found a ring on an allotment, and a refugee helped return a lost wallet in Sheffield. The letters praise the kindness of everyday people and the health service."
