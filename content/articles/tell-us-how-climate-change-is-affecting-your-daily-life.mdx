title: "Tell Us How Climate Change Is Affecting Your Daily Life"
summary: "The Guardian is asking Americans to share how climate change has touched their everyday lives this year. It wants stories about small, personal losses—like a dried‑up river, a missing tree, or a campfire that can no longer be used because of wildfire risks. Readers can describe how these changes make them feel, what they’ve done in response, or how they’re coping with the quiet, non‑headline impacts of a warming world."
