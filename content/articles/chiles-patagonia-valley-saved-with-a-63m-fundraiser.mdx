title: "Chile’s Patagonia Valley Saved with a $63m Fundraiser"
summary: "A 133,000‑hectare valley in Chile’s Patagonia was bought for $63 million after a grassroots fundraiser led by local NGOs. The land now stays free of logging, dams and big‑scale tourism. It contains old alerce trees, waterfalls, hummingbirds and endangered deer. Local farmers and climbers helped stop a huge hydro‑electric plan and a luxury‑home development. The area is now protected, limited to 15,000 visitors a year, and may become a national park in the future."
