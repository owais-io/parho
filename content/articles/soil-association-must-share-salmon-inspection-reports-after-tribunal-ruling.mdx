title: "Soil Association Must Share Salmon Inspection Reports After Tribunal Ruling"
summary: "WildFish, a campaign group, fought to get the Soil Association's salmon farm inspection reports, saying that the ‘organic’ label on farmed fish misleads shoppers. A tribunal ruled the charity must share the data, after 18 months of legal battles. The reports show that organic salmon farms still use chemicals like pesticides and formaldehyde, raising doubts about the sector’s claims. The decision could push the Soil Association to tighten its salmon standards."
