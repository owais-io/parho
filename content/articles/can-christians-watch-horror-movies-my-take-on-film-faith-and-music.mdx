title: "Can Christians Watch Horror Movies? My Take on Film, Faith and Music"
summary: "I love Sam Raimi’s new film *Send Help* and wrote a rave review, but it sparked a debate: should Christians see horror? I argue that scary films can be fine if they carry a positive message, like *The Exorcist*. My own church once tried to ban movies and rock music, but I’ve always found that faith is about welcoming people, not shunning entertainment. This clash between strict puritans and more open Christians shows that modern churches are still wrestling over what’s acceptable in the media."
