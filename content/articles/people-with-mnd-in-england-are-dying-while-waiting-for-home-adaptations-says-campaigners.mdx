title: "People with MND in England are dying while waiting for home adaptations, says campaigners"
summary: "People with motor neurone disease (MND) in England are dying while they wait for essential home adaptations because the Disabled Facilities Grant is slow. The MND Association says it takes an average of 375 days for work to start, and many patients die within a year or two of diagnosis. Families are forced to spend their savings on DIY fixes, and some have fallen or lived in unsafe homes. Campaigners call for a fast‑track process and more funding."
