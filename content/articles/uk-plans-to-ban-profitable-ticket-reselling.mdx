title: "UK Plans to Ban Profitable Ticket Reselling"
summary: "UK plans to stop people from selling concert tickets for a profit. The new rule will forbid reselling above the price you bought it for, and will also limit extra fees that sites can charge. The change comes after artists like Radiohead and Coldplay asked the government to tackle high‑priced “touts”. Some ticket sites fear the law will push sales to unregulated markets, but the government says it will reduce fraud and protect fans."
