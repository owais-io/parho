title: "Indonesian Cave Hand Sketch May Be the World’s Oldest Rock Art"
summary: "Scientists in Indonesia found a hand shape on a cave wall that could be the world’s oldest rock art, dated at least 67,800 years old. The stencil was discovered on Muna Island’s limestone cave, hidden beneath newer paintings. The find helps scholars trace early human movement from Southeast Asia to Australia, suggesting a northern island route. Researchers used calcite layers to date the artwork and debate whether it was painted by our ancestors or other human species."
