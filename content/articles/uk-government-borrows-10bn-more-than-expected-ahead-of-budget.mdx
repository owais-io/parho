title: "UK government borrows £10bn more than expected ahead of budget"
summary: "The UK has spent almost £10bn more than the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted, putting its deficit at £116.8bn so far. This forces Chancellor Rachel Reeves to make the next budget tighter, likely raising taxes and cutting spending. Bond investors are watching to see how much “headroom” the government keeps for future budgets. The government also plans cost‑of‑living help, like freezing prescription charges, to ease inflation."
