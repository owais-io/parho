title: "Sydney Water Blames Restaurants for Fatberg, Businesses Say They’re Not at Fault"
summary: "Sydney Water says up to 12,000 restaurants and food shops in the city’s southwest are dumping fats and oils into the sewage system, creating a huge fatball that has clogged beaches. The corporation blames the food industry for not keeping proper grease traps and for not registering with its WasteSafe program. Restaurants argue the problem is on Sydney Water’s side because the new digital system made it easier to slip under the radar. Experts say the number could be wrong but many businesses do lack approval."
