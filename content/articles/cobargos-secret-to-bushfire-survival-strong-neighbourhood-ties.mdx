title: "Cobargo’s Secret to Bushfire Survival: Strong Neighbourhood Ties"
summary: "After the 2019 Black Summer fires, Cobargo realised that having hoses and plans isn’t enough – what saved the town was the community’s tight bonds. Neighbours train together, share water tanks and solar power, and rely on local clubs for quick help. Cities face the same problem: people know fewer neighbours, so they’re more vulnerable. The lesson is simple: build strong local connections before a crisis. It’s not just supplies; it’s people."
