title: "Netherlands pauses seizure of Chinese chipmaker Nexperia"
summary: "After a week‑long battle that nearly halted car production worldwide, the Netherlands has stopped its takeover of Nexperia, a Chinese‑owned chip company. China had earlier banned exports of Nexperia chips, causing supply disruptions for automakers. Now that the ban is lifted and chips are flowing again, Dutch officials say they are giving Beijing a “goodwill” gesture and will keep talking with China. The Dutch may re‑take control if the risk returns."
