title: "NDIS “Robo‑Planning” Change Could Endanger Disabled People, Advocates Warn"
summary: "The Australian government plans to replace the current National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) planning system with a computer‑driven “robo‑planning” model that will cut out human decision‑making. Critics say the change could put disabled people at risk because wrong plans would be hard to challenge and appeals will be weakened. NDIA says plans can still be reviewed, but many disability advocates fear the new system will lock people into unfair, inflexible support boxes."
