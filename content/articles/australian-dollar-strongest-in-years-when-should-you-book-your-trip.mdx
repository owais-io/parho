title: "Australian Dollar Strongest in Years: When Should You Book Your Trip?"
summary: "Australia’s dollar has hit its best level in years, beating the US, euro, and yen. Experts say the strong rate is linked to higher Aussie interest rates, a solid economy and a falling US dollar. It could stay near 70 US cents for a few months, then dip. For travellers, now is a good time to book US, Japan, or EU trips before the rate slides."
