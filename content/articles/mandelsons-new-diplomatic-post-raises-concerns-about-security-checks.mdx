title: "Mandelson’s new diplomatic post raises concerns about security checks"
summary: "Peter Mandelson was appointed as a senior UK diplomat, but the security checks he went through were rushed and may have missed important details. Former adviser Peter Ricketts said the vetting system should ask tougher questions because of Mandelson’s 30‑year political career and links to Epstein and a Russian billionaire. Critics say the process was too quick and relied too much on a single referee. Politicians call for a stricter vetting review."
