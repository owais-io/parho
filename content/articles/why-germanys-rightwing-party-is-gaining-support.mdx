title: "Why Germany’s Right‑Wing Party Is Gaining Support"
summary: "The letter says Germany’s growing far‑right party, the AfD, is thriving because the federal government—made up of conservatives and Social Democrats—keeps raising living costs and rents while worsening inequality. People fear big business, climate change plans, and a global elite, so they turn to the AfD. Modern fascism isn’t about race but about using the police and bureaucracy to exclude outsiders. To stop it, we must tackle the economic fears and stop state overreach."
