title: "York University’s northern students start a society to feel at home"
summary: "A student from the north, Lucy Morville, was shocked to find most people at York University were from London and Cambridge. She helped start the Northern Society to bring northern students together. The group hosts themed events like a fancy‑dress pub crawl and a Yorkshire Olympics with black‑pudding throws. It also gives northern students a space to share their culture and counter accent‑based bullying. The society helps them feel less isolated."
