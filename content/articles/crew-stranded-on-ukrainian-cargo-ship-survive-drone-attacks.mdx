title: "Crew stranded on Ukrainian cargo ship survive drone attacks"
summary: "A crew of 15 from India, Egypt and Turkey were left aboard the MT Nathan in the port of Izmail, Ukraine, after a dispute between ship owners. For three months they lived in a war zone, hearing and seeing Russian drone attacks every night. They had no fuel, no pay and no permission to leave. The International Transport Workers’ Federation helped get them to a hotel in Odesa, but bombs still fell nearby. They finally repatriated in November."
