title: "Leaseholders forced to pay unfair service charges"
summary: "Leaseholders pay service charges for building upkeep but have little control over them. The current law lets landlords add extra floors and then force leaseholders to cover the cost of fixing any problems that arise. Even if the landlord does the work, the leaseholders still owe the money and tribunals often rule in favor of the landlord. The writer urges Parliament to reform the unfair system."
