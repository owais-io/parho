title: "Labour looks to Angela Rayner after Andy Burnham blocked"
summary: "Andy Burnham’s chance to re‑enter Parliament has been blocked, so Labour is turning its attention back to Angela Rayner, the former deputy and housing secretary. Rayner wants a cabinet post, but no seat is open yet and she’s under an HMRC tax investigation. If Starmer steps down, she may run for leader, though she faces doubts from some MPs and worries about her partner’s past deselection. Her support base is unclear."
