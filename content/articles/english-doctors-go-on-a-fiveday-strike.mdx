title: "English doctors go on a five‑day strike"
summary: "Resident doctors in England have started a five‑day strike after the government’s latest offer was rejected. The BMA said 83% of doctors surveyed voted against the proposal, which only added more training spots but did not raise pay. This is the 14th walkout since March 2023, and NHS leaders warn patients may suffer, especially during flu season and holiday staffing shortages. It will run until Monday morning."
