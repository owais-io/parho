title: "Can Rachel Reeves Cut the UK’s Borrowing Costs?"
summary: "The UK is still paying a high premium to borrow money. 10‑year gilts are about 70 basis points higher than US bonds and 25 points higher than euro‑zone bonds. If that gap closed, the Treasury could save about £7 bn a year. Recent moves by chancellor Rachel Reeves to stick to fiscal rules have nudged yields down a little, but growth worries and politics mean the gains are still fragile."
