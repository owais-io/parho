title: "Australia’s PM Wants Stricter Gun Laws After Bondi Beach Attack"
summary: "Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese wants tighter gun laws after a violent attack on Bondi beach. He says more safety rules and a national gun registry are needed. The gun lobby, the National Party and some state leaders argue the problem is not guns but radicalisation and antisemitism. They say the new laws are a distraction and could hurt lawful gun owners. The government plans to limit licences, share police intelligence, and fast‑track a national register."
