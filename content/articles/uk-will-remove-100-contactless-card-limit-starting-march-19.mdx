title: "UK Will Remove £100 Contactless Card Limit Starting March 19"
summary: "From March 19, the FCA will let banks remove the £100 limit on contactless card payments. People can then tap as many times as they want without a PIN, but they can still set limits or disable it. The current rule of a £300 cumulative limit or five taps before a PIN will stay unless a bank chooses to change it. Most providers are likely to keep limits for now. While contactless is popular, some worry about impulse spending."
