title: "Phillipson Must Stand Firm with Treasury to Protect Children with Special Needs"
summary: "The government’s special‑needs crisis is more than money. Families fight years to get help, and schools can’t keep up. The Treasury hasn’t funded local councils enough, so spending on special needs could hit £6.6 billion next year. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson paused a white paper, raising concerns about delay. Labour wants kids with extra needs to learn in normal schools, not separate rooms, and the government must back that with real money and clear plans."
