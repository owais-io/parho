title: "Storm Chandra Floods Bridport, Then the River Recedes"
summary: "We got a big rain warning and the night delivered a downpour that soaked the already wet ground. By morning the River Brit had risen, flooding the town and carving new lakes. Paths turned into streams and even the allotments were swept away. Later the storm cleared, the water receded, and the birds returned—squirrels, sparrows, and crows all taking to the now‑dry streets. It was a dramatic but brief day of change."
