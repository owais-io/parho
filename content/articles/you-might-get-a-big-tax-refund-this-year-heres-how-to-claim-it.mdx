title: "You Might Get a Big Tax Refund This Year – Here’s How to Claim It"
summary: "The Treasury says 2026 could be a refund year because a new law lets people who receive tips or overtime, older adults, and small‑business owners claim large deductions. If you didn’t lower your tax withholdings, you may have over‑paid. File your 2025 return soon to see if you’re owed money, then adjust 2026 withholdings so you keep more in every paycheck."
