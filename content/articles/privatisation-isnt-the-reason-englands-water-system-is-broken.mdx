title: "Privatisation Isn't the Reason England’s Water System Is Broken"
summary: "Sir Jon Cunliffe, who wrote a government report on England’s water industry, says the problems—like water shortages, sewage scandals and bad pipes—aren’t caused by privatisation. His review, which the government turned into a white paper, proposes stronger oversight, a new regulator and quick fixes for failing companies. Campaigners still want the system nationalised, but Cunliffe warns that changing ownership alone won’t solve the issues. He also wants top managers held personally accountable."
