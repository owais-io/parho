title: "WHO warns: shortage of new weight‑loss drugs will slow global fight against obesity"
summary: "WHO says medicines such as Mounjaro and Ozempic could help people lose weight, but only about one in ten who need them can get them right now. Production limits mean only 100 million people could be treated, far below the 1 billion who could benefit. The agency urges cheaper prices, more production and better health‑care access, while reminding patients that diet, exercise and counselling are also vital."
