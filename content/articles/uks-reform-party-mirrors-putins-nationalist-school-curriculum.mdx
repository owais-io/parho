title: "UK’s Reform Party Mirrors Putin’s Nationalist School Curriculum"
summary: "In Russia, schools now teach patriotic lessons praising Putin and national history. The UK’s Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, wants a similar curriculum that stresses love of Britain and rejects liberal ideas. The article links this nationalist education to far‑right movements in the US and Europe that support Putin and Trump. It argues that such schools aim to replace diverse identities with a single, leader‑driven patriotism."
