title: "Why Comedy Is Filling in for Politics"
summary: "Because news shows have stopped covering politics clearly, shows like The Daily Show and John Oliver use jokes to expose lies and scandals. They can make people laugh while giving facts, but they can’t replace real journalism. In France, satirical shows were less popular because the press still did its job, but new owners are making media more partisan. The writer warns that if comedians keep taking over, society risks losing a trustworthy news source."
