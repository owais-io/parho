title: "Labour Invites Influencers to Downing Street to Share Policies"
summary: "Last year, Labour's No 10 opened its doors to content creators, letting them attend briefings and use government‑approved phones. They filmed and shared policy updates, especially about finance, to reach younger viewers who trust influencers more than politicians. While journalists worried creators lacked expertise, the strategy aims to rebuild trust and spread clear information. It’s a new way for the government to use social media to explain policies."
