title: "Mayors Urge Dropping Hillsborough Law Change"
summary: "Mayors of Liverpool and Manchester have asked the government to drop a proposed change to the Hillsborough law. The change would let intelligence officers decide what information is shared after big incidents, giving a wide “opt‑out” that could hide mistakes. The mayors say this risks cover‑ups and weakens the law’s goal of finding the truth. They want the bill to remain strong, without loopholes, after the 1989 tragedy that killed 97 fans."
