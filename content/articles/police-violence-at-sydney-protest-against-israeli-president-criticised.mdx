title: "Police violence at Sydney protest against Israeli president criticised"
summary: "Police officers used punches and pepper spray at a Sydney protest against Israeli president Isaac Herzog’s visit. Experts say the violence was unnecessary and caused by government‑set restrictions that squeezed protesters inside a containment line. The premier defended the police, but law professors call the force excessive and urge an investigation by the NSW police watchdog. The incident sparked calls for better crowd‑control and clearer rules."
