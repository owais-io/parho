title: "Record Ocean Heat Fuels Stronger Storms and Floods"
summary: "Scientists say 2025 set a new record for how hot the world’s oceans are, with more than 90% of the heat from carbon pollution ending up in the seas. This extra heat makes storms, heavy rains, floods and marine heatwaves worse, and pushes sea level up. The oceans are probably the warmest in a thousand years and are heating faster than any time in the last two millennia. Unless emissions drop, the record will keep falling."
