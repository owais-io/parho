title: "UK supermarkets import European turkeys as avian flu cuts UK supply"
summary: "Several UK supermarkets are buying turkeys from Europe because avian flu has hit British farms. Asda, Lidl and Morrisons are selling small numbers of European birds under their own brands to keep shelves full for Christmas, but less than 10% of their total turkey sales will be non‑British. Other stores like Co‑op, Tesco and Marks & Spencer keep their turkeys 100% British. Farmers and the government are working to contain the outbreak and protect supply."
