title: "Many English patients miss hospital care because referrals get lost or delayed"
summary: "A recent study shows that one in seven people who need hospital treatment in England don’t get it because their GP’s referral is lost, rejected, or delayed. About 75% of those stuck suffer health problems, and 70% only find out their referral failed after they chase it themselves. The report says poor communication and long waits are hurting patients, and the NHS is working on fixes, but the problem still exists."
