title: "UK immigration rules could split nurses’ families"
summary: "A survey of more than 1,000 migrants, many working in health care, says three‑in‑five fear their families will be torn apart by new immigration rules. The Home Secretary plans to double the time needed to get permanent residence – from 5 to 10 years – and could extend it to 15 years for low‑skill jobs. Critics say the changes will drive 50,000 nurses out, threatening the NHS, and will push many families into poverty."
