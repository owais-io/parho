title: "Wetherspoon’s profits fall as costs soar"
summary: "Wetherspoon’s half‑year profits are expected to fall because costs have jumped by £45 million, driven by higher energy bills, wages, repairs and business rates. The announcement triggered a 6% drop in shares, and one pub closes daily across the UK. The government says it will introduce a support package for pubs, but it excludes the wider hospitality sector. Industry groups warn higher business rates could push more jobs out."
