title: "France bars U.S. ambassador from minister talks after missed meeting"
summary: "France’s foreign minister has barred U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner from meeting French ministers after he skipped a summons about the U.S. embassy’s comments on a far‑right activist’s death. Kushner sent a staffer instead of attending, making it his second missed meeting. The minister says he can only resume normal duties once the ambassador explains his refusal. France says the move won’t hurt overall U.S.–France ties, but limits his work in Paris."
