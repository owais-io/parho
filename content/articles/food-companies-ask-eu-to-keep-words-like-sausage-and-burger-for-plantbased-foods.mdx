title: "Food companies ask EU to keep words like ‘sausage’ and ‘burger’ for plant‑based foods"
summary: "More than a dozen food firms want the EU to stop banning terms like “sausage” and “burger” on plant‑based products. They say the rule would confuse shoppers and hurt small producers. Companies such as Quorn, Aldi and Lidl, plus the Vegetarian Society, wrote a joint letter urging common sense. If passed, bean burgers might have to be called “patties” instead. The EU law still needs approval from all member states."
