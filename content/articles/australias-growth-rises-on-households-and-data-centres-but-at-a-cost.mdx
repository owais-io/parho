title: "Australia’s Growth Rises on Households and Data Centres – But at a Cost"
summary: "Australia’s economy grew 2.1% last year, mainly because people are spending more. Households spent 55% of their extra money on essentials like electricity, gas, health and insurance, which shows that living costs are still high. Rooftop solar panels and lower mortgage rates have boosted incomes and cut emissions. At the same time, big investment in data centres is driving growth but will use a lot of electricity and could raise greenhouse‑gas emissions, threatening the country’s climate targets."
