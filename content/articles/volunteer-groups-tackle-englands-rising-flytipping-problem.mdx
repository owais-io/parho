title: "Volunteer groups tackle England’s rising fly‑tipping problem"
summary: "Volunteers in England are stepping in to clean up a growing problem of illegal dumping, called fly‑tipping. Groups like the Wombles pick up trash from roadside verges and private land, showing community spirit. The government says authorities dealt with 1.26 million incidents last year, costing £19 million. Fewer prosecutions and tighter budgets make it hard to stop offenders. Some call for more education instead of just enforcement. Farmers and councils also struggle to manage the waste."
