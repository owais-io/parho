title: "Reanimal review: A Creepy Adventure You’ll Never Forget"
summary: "Reanimal is a spooky puzzle‑platformer where two kids explore a ruined world full of monsters. The game starts hard but pulls you in quickly, with clever puzzles, tense chases, and dark humor. It’s got the same creepy vibe as Little Nightmares, but adds silly moments like piloting a tank. Visuals are striking, but the story never hits the emotional punch of its predecessor. The game released on 13 Feb and stays on the couch for about six hours."
