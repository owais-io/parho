title: "Truth or Myth? Fact‑checking Trump’s State of the Union claims"
summary: "Trump gave the longest State of the Union speech, bragging about jobs, investments, lower gas prices, and ending wars. Fact‑checkers say his job growth claim is wrong – only 181,000 new jobs in 2025, far below usual Trump or Biden levels. He counted pledged investments, not actual money, and wrongly said the gunman who killed a Ukrainian woman was an immigrant. Energy bills rose 6.7%, not fell."
