title: "Lava Lamps Are Making a Comeback"
summary: "Lava lamps are back in style, with sales climbing thanks to a love of mid‑century décor and Gen Z’s nostalgia for the 90s and 2000s. Mathmos, the original maker, says the lamps are comforting, calming and even useful for focus and mindfulness. The company has sold out ahead of Christmas and is running out of stock. Their classic models and collaborations, like a limited‑edition Rolling Stones lamp, fly off the shelves."
