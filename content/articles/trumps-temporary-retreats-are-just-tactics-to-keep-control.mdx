title: "Trump’s Temporary Retreats Are Just Tactics to Keep Control"
summary: "Trump’s temporary retreats are just tactics to keep control. He pulls back when pressure rises, then resumes his hard line once the heat cools. In Minneapolis, he pretended to calm the situation after a nurse was shot, but then threatened the mayor again. He keeps building ICE detention camps, pushes for Greenland access, and even sues the IRS. Democrats and allies should stay firm and not think he’s truly backing down."
