title: "Neanderthal Noses Might Not Be Built for Cold Weather"
summary: "They thought Neanderthal noses were built to warm cold air; new endoscopy on Altamura Man skull shows no bone folds that would do that. So noses may not have been specially cold‑adapted. Scientists may look at other reasons, like metabolism. If noses were fine for warm air too, why did Neanderthals die out? This new study challenges old ideas. It also means scientists will need to rethink how they explain Neanderthal survival."
