title: "CDC Wants to Stop Overdose Groups From Saying “Never Use Alone”"
summary: "The CDC is telling overdose‑prevention groups that they may not use the phrase “never use alone” in their messaging. The change follows a Trump executive order that criticises harm‑reduction programs, saying they only encourage illegal drug use. While Narcan and fentanyl test strips are still allowed, officials are unclear on what other messages can be shared. Experts warn the move could hurt people who need help and reverse progress in reducing overdose deaths."
