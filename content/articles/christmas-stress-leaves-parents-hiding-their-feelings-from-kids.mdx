title: "Christmas Stress Leaves Parents Hiding Their Feelings from Kids"
summary: "Research shows that the rush and pressure of Christmas can leave parents exhausted and emotionally distant. A study of nearly 300 parents found that as burnout rises, they are more likely to put on a happy front and hide how they really feel. This makes it harder for kids to learn that tough emotions are normal and can worsen parents' mental health. Experts advise cutting back on expectations, sharing the workload, and speaking honestly, even about being tired."
