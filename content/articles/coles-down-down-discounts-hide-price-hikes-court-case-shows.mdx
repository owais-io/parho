summary: "Coles supermarket’s “Down Down” discounts are a clever way to hide price hikes. The court case shows that for almost a year, a 1.2 kg loaf of dog food was sold at $4, then jumped to $6 for a week, and later dropped to $4.50 while still higher than most days. The company claims customers can’t see the trick, but many shoppers notice. The article questions whether big retailers can ever earn honest trust without government pressure."
