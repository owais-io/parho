title: "A Quebec lake vanished – natural event or human impact?"
summary: "A lake in northern Quebec, called Lake Rouge, drained into a larger lake last spring, leaving a muddy plain and dead fish. Experts think it was an unusual ‘outburst flood’, even though the lake had no dam or glacier. They say heavy snow melt, weak banks, and years of forest loss from wildfires and logging weakened the shoreline. The government calls it natural, but scientists warn that more lakes could disappear."
