title: "Wagner Moura to Star in New Ibsen Play at Three European Festivals"
summary: "Brazilian actor Wagner Moura will lead a new play that updates Henrik Ibsen’s classic for today. Titled “A Trial – after An Enemy of the People,” it will run at the Edinburgh International Festival, Festival d’Avignon and Holland Festival next year. The story turns a town’s water crisis into a look at modern politics, climate change and rising fascism, using an audience jury and a bit of improvisation. The three post‑war festivals say the collaboration is timely and bold."
