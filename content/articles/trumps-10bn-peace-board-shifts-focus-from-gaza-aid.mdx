title: "Trump’s $10bn Peace Board Shifts Focus from Gaza Aid"
summary: "The Guardian says Washington is sending $10bn to Donald Trump’s new “Board of Peace,” but Gaza is still stuck with shortages and little aid. Relief agencies say food, shelter and medicine are far below what people need. Trump’s plan would rebuild Gaza with skyscrapers and even move 20,000 troops in, but it lacks legal backing and ignores UN rules. Critics worry the money is meant for private profits, not people."
