title: "West Ham fans at Forest match were only about half of reported crowd"
summary: "West Ham announced 62,429 people at the London Stadium, but only around 34,000 fans actually entered. The club reports attendance based on tickets sold, not the number who turn up, which can mislead. Fans have been unhappy with the new stadium, distance from the pitch, and the sense of emptiness. Poor weather, a busy schedule, and the game being televised also kept many from attending."
