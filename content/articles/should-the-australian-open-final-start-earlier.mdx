title: "Should the Australian Open Final Start Earlier?"
summary: "People are arguing whether the Australian Open men’s final should start earlier. The tournament is now a night match to make money from TV deals, keep the crowds inside cool air and match Asia‑Pacific fans’ time zone. The US and other Grand Slams play in the afternoon, but the Australians have a huge, loyal crowd and record attendance. Some say a 5 pm start would help US viewers, but most say the current night schedule works."
