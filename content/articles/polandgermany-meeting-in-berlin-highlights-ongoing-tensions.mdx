title: "Poland‑Germany Meeting in Berlin Highlights Ongoing Tensions"
summary: "Poland and Germany are set to talk in Berlin, but old tensions stay. Polish leader Donald Tusk and German chancellor Friedrich Merz will discuss Ukraine, but Poland wants more than just words. It feels its past wounds from WWII and migration policy are ignored, and it wants money for wartime damage and the return of looted art. Germany offers small payments and a plan to bring back some items, but trust is still low."
