title: "Britain’s Voting System Is Out of Date, But I Still Don’t Think Reform Is the Answer"
summary: "The article looks at a recent Manchester election that turned into a three‑way race between Labour, Reform UK and the Greens, showing how the current first‑past‑the‑post system can give winners a small share of the vote. The writer explains why the system was built for a two‑party world and argues that moving to proportional representation could create its own problems, like fragile coalitions and powerful fringe parties. He remains skeptical that changing the rules will solve the problems."
