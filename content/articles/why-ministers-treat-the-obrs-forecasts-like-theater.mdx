title: "Why Ministers Treat the OBR’s Forecasts Like Theater"
summary: "The Guardian argues that the press and ministers treat the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts like a circus. The OBR admits its predictions are often wrong, but politicians use them to reassure bond markets and hide a future deficit. The piece suggests better options: cutting interest costs, taxing bank windfalls, and ending the Treasury’s protection of QE losses. These could improve the budget without hurting public services."
