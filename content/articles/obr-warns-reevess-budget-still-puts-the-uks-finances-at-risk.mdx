title: "OBR warns Reeves’s budget still puts the UK’s finances at risk"
summary: "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says Rachel Reeves’s new budget, though it more than doubles the country’s financial cushion, still leaves the UK’s finances exposed to shocks. The OBR warns that a market crash or pandemic could still hit the budget hard, and that growth is expected to be slower than earlier forecasts. While the budget raises taxes to build a bigger buffer, spending will rise for the next five years and borrowing will climb before easing later."
