summary: "Neha, a 25‑year‑old warehouse worker in Manesar, Haryana, struggled during the 2024 heatwave. Temperatures hit 46–50 °C, making her 30‑minute walk to work unbearably hot. Inside the warehouse she had to move 150 items a hour without fans, causing sweat and heat stress. The extreme heat left her sick, fainted, and unable to speak or breathe.
