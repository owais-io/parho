summary: "Poundland has shut 149 shops and let 2,200 staff go after a tough year of falling sales. The company, now owned by Gordon Brothers, is refocusing on £1 items, with 60 % of its stock at that price. It will bring back its Pep & Co clothing line and drop most frozen foods and its loyalty app. Profits have risen, but store sales fell, so the firm is restructuring to stay afloat."
