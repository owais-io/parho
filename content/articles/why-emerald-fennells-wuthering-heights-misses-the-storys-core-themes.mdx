title: "Why Emerald Fennell’s Wuthering Heights Misses the Story’s Core Themes"
summary: "The Guardian columnist says Emerald Fennell’s movie version of Wuthering Heights keeps the love story but skips the novel’s real points about class, race, and abuse. She points out the cast choices, like Margot Robbie as a teen and a white actor for Heathcliff, and criticises the film’s focus on sex and drama instead of power struggles. The writer feels the film ignores the novel’s deeper social issues and shows how the director’s background shaped the adaptation."
