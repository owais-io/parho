title: "Australia Must Tighten Gun Laws After the Bondi Attack"
summary: "Australia must tighten gun laws after the Bondi attack. The recent shooting shows older laws are no longer enough. After the Port Arthur massacre, stricter rules were introduced, but more guns are now in circulation and some people have hundreds. New laws aim to keep guns out of the wrong hands, create a national registry, and limit high‑capacity weapons. The government and states will work together to stop future violence and protect the country."
