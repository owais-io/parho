summary: "* **Supreme Court and tariffs**     - The Court is looking at a big question: can the President put on many new tariffs on goods from other countries?     - Trump has said these tariffs are a big part of his economic plan. He thinks the Court could undo them, and he says that would be a huge mess.     - The Court will decide soon, maybe next Wednesday.   * **Fed Chair Jerome Powell**     - Trump has criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough.     - Now Powell is being investigated by federal prosecutors.     - The investigation is about costly renovations to Fed buildings, but many think it is a political trick.     - Banks around the world – the Bank of England, the ECB, the Bank of Canada – have sent letters saying the Fed must stay independent.   * **Greenside and Greenland**     - President Trump is pushing the U.S. to take control of Greenland, an island that is part of Denmark.     - Danish and Greenlandic leaders are meeting with U.S. officials to discuss this.   * **Trans‑gender athletes and school sports**     - In two state court cases, young trans athletes sued laws that banned them from sports teams.     - The Supreme Court is hearing these cases. The outcome could change the rules in many states that restrict trans athletes from playing on teams.   * **Other things**     - Trump announced a 25 % tariff on any country that trades with Iran.     - China and other big trading partners with Iran say they will fight back if the U.S. tries to cut their trade.   In short, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide a big tariff case, the Fed is under a federal investigation, and Trump is pushing for strong economic and military moves. The Court’s decision could change a lot of U.S. policy."
