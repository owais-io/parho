summary: "Australia’s rugby team, the Wallabies, came into a European tour looking confident after recent wins. But they lost badly to Ireland 46–19, showing big problems with ball handling, defense and leadership. Coach Eddie Jones pointed to a weak fly‑half as the main issue, saying the team needs a steady playmaker instead of relying on flashy play.
