title: "UK sees record number of families in extreme poverty"
summary: "A new study found 6.8 million people in the UK are living in “very deep poverty”, the worst level of poverty for 30 years. That means their income is so low they can’t cover basic food, energy, or clothes. About 1.9 million people stay in this situation year after year, and 3.8 million are in even worse “destitution”. The report says no progress was made under the last Conservative government, and it calls on the current Labour government to act faster on poverty and food‑bank use."
