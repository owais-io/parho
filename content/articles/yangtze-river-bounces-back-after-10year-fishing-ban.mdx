title: "Yangtze River Bounces Back After 10‑Year Fishing Ban"
summary: "China’s 10‑year fishing ban on the Yangtze River has helped the river’s wildlife recover. Scientists found that fish numbers and variety almost doubled after the ban, and endangered species like the finless porpoise grew from 400 to 600. The government spent about $3 billion to pay fishers and give them new jobs. The results show that strict rules can fix damaged ecosystems, but illegal fishing and pollution still threaten the river."
