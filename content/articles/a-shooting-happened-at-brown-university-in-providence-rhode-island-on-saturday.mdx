title: "A shooting happened at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday."
summary: "The attack was in an engineering building while students were taking final exams.   Two students were killed.   Nine people were wounded.   All were treated at local hospitals.   The shooter was seen in black.   He walked away from the scene.   The police did not catch him at the school.   Later, the police said a “person of interest” was taken into custody.   That person is about thirty years old.   The police have not said if he is a student or how he is linked to the school.   The police searched the campus and the surrounding area for days.   They used many officers and checked video cameras.   The police had a large presence around the school and nearby neighborhoods.   Brown’s president, Christina Paxson, told students that classes were postponed.   The university has set up support offices for people who were hurt.   Students who were injured were in critical but stable condition.   The city’s mayor, Brett Smiley, said a heavier police presence would be seen.   He urged people near the campus to stay inside until the police say it is safe.   The shooting was a tragic reminder of how often school shootings happen in the United States.   Community leaders, including the mayor and the university, are helping people heal.   They are offering prayers, counseling, and other help for anyone who was affected."
