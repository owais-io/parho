title: "Peruvian Amazon Stingless Bees Get Legal Rights for the First Time"
summary: "Scientists and Indigenous people in Peru pushed for protection of the Amazon’s stingless bees, which have no sting but are vital pollinators. In 2024, two local governments gave the bees legal rights, the first time insects have that status worldwide. The laws require safer habitats, less pesticide use, and more research. The move helps fight climate change, deforestation and competition from aggressive European honeybees. The decision could inspire similar protections elsewhere."
