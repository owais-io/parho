title: "Victoria police end warrantless search powers in inner Melbourne"
summary: "Police in Victoria have ended a six‑month plan that let officers stop and search anyone in Melbourne’s CBD and surrounding areas without a warrant or reason. The move was announced earlier than expected and will take effect on 9 January 2026. Legal and civil‑rights groups say the power was rarely used and unfairly targeted minority communities. A court hearing will decide on the declaration’s future, while police say they will still conduct other safety patrols."
