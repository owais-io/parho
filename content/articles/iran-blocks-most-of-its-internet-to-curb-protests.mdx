title: "Iran blocks most of its internet to curb protests"
summary: "Iran has shut down about 90% of its internet traffic to try to stop growing protests. The blackout began 36 hours ago and is very advanced, blocking most phone service and even some satellite links. While the government still posts on social media, experts say only a few sites stay open for officials. Because the block is so precise, the authorities could keep it going for a long time."
