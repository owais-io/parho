title: "Crystal Palace’s Cup win leaves them stuck in mid‑table"
summary: "Crystal Palace won the FA Cup, a huge moment for the club. But after the trophy they couldn’t keep the momentum. Key players left, the manager left, and the club has been selling young talent to stay in the Premier League. The money from the win isn’t enough to jump ahead, so they keep finishing around 10th‑15th. Without a big cash boost, climbing higher seems impossible."
