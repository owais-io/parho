title: "Trump’s Cabinet Is Being Called the Worst in US History"
summary: "After the 2024 election, Trump unveiled a new cabinet many say is the worst in US history. Picks include Matt Gaetz, Pete Hegseth, anti‑vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and former Texas governor Kristi Noem. Their rule has caused problems—overspending on private jets, cutting health funding, turning the Justice Department into a political tool, and making the military focus on domestic patrols. Critics have called for several resignations, saying the president chose loyalty over competence."
