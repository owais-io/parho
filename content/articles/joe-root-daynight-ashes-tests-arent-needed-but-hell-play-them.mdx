summary: "Joe Root thinks day‑night Ashes Tests aren’t necessary, but he will play them and wants to beat Australia’s fast bowlers, especially Mitchell Starc. His scores drop in pink‑ball games, but he hopes to improve. England lost the first Test and needs runs from their top batters. Team changes include Mark Wood out and Will Jacks possibly in.
