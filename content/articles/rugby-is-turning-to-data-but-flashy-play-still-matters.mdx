title: "Rugby is Turning to Data, but Flashy Play Still Matters"
summary: "The Six Nations is coming, but recent club wins show something new. Northampton beat Bath with quick passes, not many kicks, and Bristol beat the Bulls with 60 points. Both show that moving the ball fast and smart can beat defence. Analyst Sam Larner says rugby is using data like Moneyball, but teams still need flair. He published a book on this and thinks more attacking play and less wasted time will make the game more exciting."
