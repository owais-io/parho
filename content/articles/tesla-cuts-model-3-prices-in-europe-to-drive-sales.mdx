title: "Tesla Cuts Model 3 Prices in Europe to Drive Sales"
summary: "Tesla has lowered the price of its Model 3 in Europe, offering a cheaper “Standard” version that still gives over 300 miles of range. The move follows a similar price cut for the Model Y and comes as sales are falling after customers reacted poorly to Elon Musk’s political comments. Competition from BYD and new UK taxes on electric cars are also making it harder for Tesla to grow its European market."
