title: "End the rule that lets suspected rapists stay free for years"
summary: "In England and Wales, a rule called “release under investigation” lets police keep people free while they look into possible rape or sexual assault. It can last for years because there’s no deadline for charging. Victims say the long wait hurts them and can even cause them to quit the case. Over 1,800 suspects have waited three years or more. Lawmakers and charities want the rule replaced with normal bail to speed justice."
