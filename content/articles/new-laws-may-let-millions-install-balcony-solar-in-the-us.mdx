summary: "New laws in several U.S. states are making it easier to buy small, plug‑in solar panels for balconies. Utah was first, and New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maryland and New Hampshire are moving to join. The panels fit onto a wall socket and can run fridges, washing machines and Wi‑Fi without paying the grid.
