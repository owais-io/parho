title: "UK asylum policy linked to rising violence and deaths, rights groups say"
summary: "Human rights groups say the UK’s push to stop asylum seekers in small boats is making Channel crossings more dangerous. A 176‑page report from 17 refugee groups and six UK charities says French police use rubber bullets and tear gas, and that UK money has helped smuggler gangs get stronger. Despite 39,000 crossings this year, the policy hasn’t stopped arrivals. The report urges a formal inquiry and safe routes for people seeking asylum."
