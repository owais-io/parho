title: "Lords urged not to stall assisted‑dying bill"
summary: "A group of former ministers and a committee chair wrote to the Guardian, asking the House of Lords not to block an assisted‑dying bill by dragging out debates. Only 80 of more than 1,150 amendments have been looked at, and critics fear the bill will run out of time before the parliamentary session ends. Opponents say the Lords’ slow process risks undermining the Commons’ decision and may set a bad precedent. They want the bill to be voted on quickly."
