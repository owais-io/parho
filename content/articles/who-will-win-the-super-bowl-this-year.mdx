title: "Who will win the Super Bowl this year?"
summary: "The playoffs look open. The Cowboys have a great offense but a weak defense. Detroit’s Lions are solid, especially with defender Aidan Hutchinson. The Chiefs are down a star quarterback, while the Bengals could surprise with Joe Burrow and two top receivers. The Bears depend on turnovers and may stumble. The Patriots are strong on offense but weak on defense. The Rams are the most balanced and likely to go far, but the Jaguars and Bills have big chances too."
