title: "Trump’s Lies Fuel Trouble in Greenland, Venezuela and Ukraine"
summary: "Donald Trump has made thousands of false claims, and his lies are stirring trouble in three places. He says Chinese and Russian ships are “all over” Greenland to justify taking control for minerals, while Greenlanders reject his nonsense. In Venezuela, he calls the leader a drug boss, pushes a coup, and seeks oil, not democracy. In Ukraine, he promises to end the war in a day, but his lies weaken NATO support and add chaos. These lies damage trust, hurt democracy, and expose Europe’s split."
