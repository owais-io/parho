title: "UK Refugees Facing Homelessness Crisis, Says Charity"
summary: "Thousands of refugees in the UK are becoming homeless, with numbers more than doubling in two years, says a charity network. 3,450 people asked for help, but only 4,434 were housed, and 829 were sleeping rough. 2,008 refugees got accommodation – a 106% jump. The crisis is blamed on constant policy shifts, short move‑on periods and anti‑immigrant sentiment. Government policy changes like the 28‑day move‑on rule and new eVisa rules make it hard for refugees to get services, the charity says."
