title: "England Rugby League Coach Shaun Wane Resigns"
summary: "Shaun Wane has stepped down as England’s rugby league coach, leaving the national team without a head coach before the World Cup. The Rugby Football League will look for a new coach, probably on a part‑time basis because the domestic schedule limits full‑time options. Candidates could include Super League managers like Willie Peters and Paul Rowley. Wane guided England to the 2022 World Cup semi‑finals but was criticised after a 3‑0 Ashes loss and a defeat to Samoa."
