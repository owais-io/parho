title: "Rural UK drivers will face much higher EV road tax"
summary: "A new UK road tax that charges 3p per mile for electric cars will hit rural drivers harder than city drivers. In 2028, people in the south‑west could pay around £110 extra a year, while Londoners will pay just £33. The tax aims to make up for lost fuel duty money, but critics fear it could slow electric‑car sales. The government says EVs will still be cheaper and greener overall."
