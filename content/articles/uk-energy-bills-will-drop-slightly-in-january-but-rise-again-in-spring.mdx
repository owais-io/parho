title: "UK Energy Bills Will Drop Slightly in January, but Rise Again in Spring"
summary: "UK households will see a small cut in their energy bills in January, thanks to cheaper wholesale gas. The regulator will lower the cap by about £22, putting an average bill at £1,733 a year. But in April the cap will jump by £75 to cover new gas and power‑grid upgrades, so bills will rise again. Most of the extra cost comes from taxes and renewable‑energy investments, not gas prices."
