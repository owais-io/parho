title: "Closed Shops Fuel Far‑Right Support in Britain"
summary: "In 2024, about 13,000 shops across Britain closed, especially in the north and poorer coastal towns. The empty streets make people feel their communities are falling apart, and many turn to the far‑right Reform UK for answers. The rise of online shopping, high rents and a cost‑of‑living crisis have hurt physical stores, while government support has been slow. Efforts like £5 bn of Pride‑in‑Place funding aim to revive local streets."
