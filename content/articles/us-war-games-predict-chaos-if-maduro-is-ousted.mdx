title: "U.S. war games predict chaos if Maduro is ousted"
summary: "In 2019, U.S. officials ran war‑game simulations for what would happen if Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, was removed. They imagined three ways: a popular revolt, a palace coup, or a foreign military attack. Each scenario ended with chaos, armed clashes, and many refugees. Experts say a power vacuum could let rival groups and even Colombian rebels fight for control, and foreign troops might face guerrilla attacks. Opposition leaders hope democracy can recover, but warn that violence could spread for years."
