title: "UK Ministers May Drop Battery Requirement for New Homes"
summary: "UK ministers are considering letting new homes in England be built without batteries, even though experts say batteries help save energy bills and support the power grid. The Future Homes Standard, due in January, will still require solar panels, good insulation and most homes to have heat pumps. Builders want to avoid extra costs, but experts warn that not having batteries could cost homeowners more and keep the UK reliant on gas."
