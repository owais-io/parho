summary: "The UK House of Lords has blocked an assisted‑dying bill that the House of Commons and many voters have supported. Critics say the Lords are using a filibuster to stop a law that lets people with terminal illnesses request a controlled death under strict safeguards. Prime Minister Keir Starmer could force the bill through, but the Lords’ opposition shows the debate is far from over."
