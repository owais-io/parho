title: "NDIS automation could cut support for people with disabilities"
summary: "From 2026 the National Disability Insurance Agency will use a new computer tool to set support budgets for people with disabilities. Staff will only accept or reject the budget, and there will be no way to appeal or adjust it. If the data the algorithm uses is wrong, people could lose hours of care, showers or therapy. Those with complex or changing disabilities are most at risk, like many who lost money under robodebt."
