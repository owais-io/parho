title: "Rail sensors may miss sudden landslides, safety warning issued"
summary: "An Avanti West Coast train derailed near Shap, Cumbria, when a landslip hit the tracks on 3 November. Investigators found the earth‑monitoring sensors didn't detect the rapid slide and their wireless signals failed when buried in debris. The rail safety board warned that such sensors may not catch fast slope failures, especially during heavy rain. Network Rail says it will upgrade the equipment and has pledged almost £100 m to strengthen earthworks, with four passengers injured."
