title: "UK raises farm inheritance tax limit to £2.5 million after farmer protests"
summary: "Farmers in the UK have won a big win. Ministers have raised the inheritance tax limit on farmland from £1 million to £2.5 million. That means most family farms won’t have to pay tax when a landowner dies. The change came after protests and pressure from MPs. It will cut the number of farms that pay the tax from 375 to 185 next year. The government says it will still bring in about £300 million a year."
