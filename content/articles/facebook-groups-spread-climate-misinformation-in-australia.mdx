title: "Facebook Groups Spread Climate Misinformation in Australia"
summary: "A solar‑battery plan in Narrabri was halted after false claims on Facebook said it would be a fire risk. The story shows how local online groups spread myths that hurt renewable projects. Politicians and right‑wing groups, like the National Rational Energy Network and the Institute of Public Affairs, use these myths to fight net‑zero targets. In Canberra, the Liberal and Nationals parties dropped the goal after the misinformation wave. The UN also launched a program to fight climate lies worldwide."
