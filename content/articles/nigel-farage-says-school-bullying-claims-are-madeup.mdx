title: "Nigel Farage says school bullying claims are made‑up"
summary: "Nigel Farage has dismissed claims that he bullied classmates with racist and antisemitic language at Dulwich College as “made‑up” and says the allegations are politically motivated. More than 30 people, including director Peter Ettedgui, have alleged hate speech, but Farage insists he never intended harm. He has refused to apologise, blamed the stories on politics, and even cancelled a Commons question to appear on Times Radio. Critics see this as deflection."
