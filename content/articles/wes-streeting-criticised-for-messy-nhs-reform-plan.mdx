title: "Wes Streeting Criticised for Messy NHS Reform Plan"
summary: "A watchdog report says health secretary Wes Streeting’s plans to reshape the NHS are chaotic and unclear. It notes some wins – hospitals are doing a little better, fewer staff quit, and a deal with resident doctors kept last winter’s strikes at bay. But the report rips the move to scrap NHS England, the loss of senior GP partners and vague plans for community care. It warns the government may miss key waiting‑time goals."
