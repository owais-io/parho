title: "AI‑Generated Report Sparks Doubt Over $20 M Gambling Education Funding"
summary: "Australian Senator David Pocock says a report sent to lawmakers by the OurFutures Institute – which backs a $20 million gambling‑education program for teens – looks like AI‑generated rubbish. The review contains broken links, fake studies and unsubstantiated claims, such as a $1–$8‑10 return on school programs that the Productivity Commission actually doubts. The institute says the mistakes were from a reference‑editing tool and will correct them. Experts call for banning gambling ads that reach kids."
