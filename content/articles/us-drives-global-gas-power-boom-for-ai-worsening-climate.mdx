title: "U.S. Drives Global Gas Power Boom for AI, Worsening Climate"
summary: "The U.S. is pushing a huge increase in new gas‑powered plants, especially to supply the electricity needed by growing data centers that run AI. This boom could add about 12 billion tonnes of CO₂ over the plants’ lifetimes – more than the U.S. emits in a year. Globally, the gas push could push total emissions higher, worsening heatwaves and other climate problems. The surge is driven by U.S. policy that favors gas and limits clean‑energy projects."
