title: "UK house prices could rise 4% next year as rates fall"
summary: "Nationwide says UK house prices could go up 2‑4% next year, helped by a likely drop in Bank of England rates. That should make buying a home a bit easier because wages grow faster than prices and lenders are easing stress‑test rules. The FCA is also easing rules for first‑time buyers and the self‑employed, and mortgage rates are falling. First‑time buyers are already taking larger loans than ever."
