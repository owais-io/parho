title: "Australia Faces Fatigue, Injuries and Fan Worries Ahead of T20 World Cup"
summary: "Australia’s men’s cricket team is in a tough spot heading into the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. With a packed calendar, many Aussie fans are tired and less likely to watch. Key players are injured or missing, and the squad lacks big‑name stars. Even the game’s schedule, with early‑morning starts for most matches, makes it hard to catch. The team has only one semi‑final spot since 2012, so expectations are low."
