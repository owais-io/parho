title: "Israel to Start Building a Road That Will Cut Off Palestinians in the West Bank"
summary: "Israel plans to start building a new road next month that will block Palestinians from traveling through a key West Bank area. The bypass is part of a big settlement plan called E1, which would split the West Bank and make a future Palestinian state harder. Only Israeli cars will be allowed on the road, while Palestinians would be stuck in isolated villages. The move has drawn criticism from many countries and international courts."
