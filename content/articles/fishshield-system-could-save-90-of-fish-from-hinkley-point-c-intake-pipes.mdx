title: "Fish‑Shield System Could Save 90% of Fish From Hinkley Point C Intake Pipes"
summary: "EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset is testing a ‘fish‑disco’ acoustic deterrent to keep fish away from its water‑intake pipes. Scientists from Swansea University found that the system could keep 90% of fish—about 44 tonnes a year—safe from being sucked in. The project will cost about £700 m, or 1.5% of the plant’s £46 bn budget, and will help the plant meet environmental rules without building salt marshes."
