title: "Asylum seekers rarely misuse modern slavery rules, report says"
summary: "A think‑tank report says most asylum seekers are not using modern slavery rules to stay in the UK. It found only a few false claims, and that most people referred for slavery checks are real victims. The report says changes to the rules are unlikely to cut asylum claims, but suggests the government train border staff to spot slavery sooner. The Home Office says it will reform the system to make it harder to block deportation."
