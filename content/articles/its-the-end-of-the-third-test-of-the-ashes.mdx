title: "It’s the end of the third Test of the Ashes."
summary: "England batted for four days. They’re now 207 for six.   Australia are chasing 435 runs to win the series.   England only have four wickets left and need 228 runs.   That’s a lot of runs in a short time.   The odds are not in England’s favour. A lot of people have been saying England will win if they reach 100 runs more than the Australians’ total.   But we’re seeing the opposite.   The Australian bowlers are doing their job, and the English batsmen are struggling.   If the English team can get within 100 runs of 435, I would feel good about the chance.   If they can’t, the Ashes will stay in Australia’s hands. It’s going to be a tense finish.   The next few hours could decide everything.   That’s the story."
