title: "Even Oddly‑Placed Benches Show City Care"
summary: "People in Bristol are puzzled by benches that face brick walls or empty space. The city says they’ll be useful once a tree is planted, but the angles look strange. The writer notes that many benches across the town face nothing or a parking lot, yet they still give people a place to sit. He argues benches, even awkward ones, are a kind gesture of civic kindness and calls for backrests."
