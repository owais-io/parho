title: "Brighton FC Bans Newspapers From Its Stadium"
summary: "Brighton FC has once again put a stop to newspapers covering its matches by banning the Guardian from the Amex Stadium. The club earlier had barred the local Evening Argus after it ran critical stories. In the 1980s, the Argus got around the ban by filming from a garden overlooking the old ground. That trick isn’t possible at the new, fully enclosed Amex arena."
