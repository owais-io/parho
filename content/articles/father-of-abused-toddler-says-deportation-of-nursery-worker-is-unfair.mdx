title: "Father of abused toddler says deportation of nursery worker is “unfair”"
summary: "A toddler’s father is upset that a Polish nursery worker, who was convicted of beating and assaulting 21 babies, will be sent back to Poland after less than five months of her eight‑year prison sentence. The UK’s early‑removal scheme lets foreign offenders leave the country before serving most of their time. Victims and some MPs say this means justice is not fully served and could let the worker harm children elsewhere."
