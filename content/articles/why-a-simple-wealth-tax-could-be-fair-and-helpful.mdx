title: "Why a Simple Wealth Tax Could Be Fair and Helpful"
summary: "Some writers argue that a small tax on people with more than £10 million could raise about £10 billion a year, enough to boost welfare and public services. Others say the tax alone won’t solve poverty but it signals a shift against the growing power of billionaires. Critics worry about too low a rate and the politics of “raiding” rich families. Overall, the debate is about using a wealth tax as a step toward fairer income distribution."
