title: "Spanish Bishops Use Video Game to Boost Church Weddings"
summary: "Spanish bishops are trying to reverse a steep drop in church weddings – only 18% of 2024 marriages were in churches, down from over 55% in 2007. Their new tool is a video game called Level Up! where a couple learns patience, generosity and other marriage virtues while playing. The game will launch around Valentine’s Day to showcase the beauty of Christian marriage and persuade couples to consider a church ceremony. Bishops also offer a premarital course on communication and fidelity."
