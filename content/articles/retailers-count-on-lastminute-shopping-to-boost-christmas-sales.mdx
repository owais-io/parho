summary: "Retailers hope a burst of weekend shoppers will lift UK Christmas sales, with forecasts of £3.4 bn spent and about 50 million visits. Super Saturday (20 Dec) is the biggest day, expected to bring in £1.75 bn. Shoppers have held off buying until they see their finances clearer, but discounts from retailers and cheaper food prices are tempting them to rush in.
