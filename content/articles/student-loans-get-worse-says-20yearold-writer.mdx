title: "Student Loans Get Worse, Says 20‑Year‑Old Writer"
summary: "A 20‑year‑old writer explains how student loans are getting harder to manage. The government has frozen the salary threshold for loan repayments until 2030, meaning about six million people will pay more. The move comes amid growing anger over rising tuition, rent, and shrinking jobs, especially with AI cutting entry‑level roles. Politically, Labour’s earlier promise to end debt feels betrayed, and the Green Party is gaining support from disaffected students."
