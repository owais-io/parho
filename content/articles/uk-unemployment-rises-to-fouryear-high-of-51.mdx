title: "UK unemployment rises to four‑year high of 5.1%"
summary: "UK unemployment climbed to 5.1% in October, the highest level since early 2021 and a four‑year peak. Jobless claims rose and payrolls fell by 38,000, showing firms are cutting staff. Wage growth eased to 4.6% in October, the lowest in 18 months. The data is pushing the Bank of England toward an interest‑rate cut, as weaker jobs and slowing wages make borrowing cheaper."
