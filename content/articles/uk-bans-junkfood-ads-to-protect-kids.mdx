title: "UK Bans Junk‑Food Ads to Protect Kids"
summary: "The UK has introduced new rules that stop junk‑food ads from being shown online and restrict them to after 9 p.m. on TV. The move aims to cut childhood obesity, especially in poorer communities where the problem is worse. Kids aren’t old enough to judge how much sugar or salt a snack contains, so the government says it must help protect them. While the ban is a welcome step, it won’t erase obesity overnight, and some advertising loopholes still exist."
