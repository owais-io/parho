title: "Psychedelic medicines help with OCD, cannabis does not"
summary: "A review of OCD treatments found that psychedelic medicine like psilocybin can help people with obsessive–compulsive disorder, but cannabis does not. Most patients do not get full relief from standard drugs or therapy. The review looked at published studies and early data, showing stronger evidence for psychedelics. Researchers say the drugs work differently in the brain. Trials face legal hurdles and challenges with patients’ expectations."
