title: "Young Britons Leave the UK for Better Jobs Abroad"
summary: "About 111,000 young Brits (16‑34) left the UK last year because jobs are scarce, wages low, and living costs high. The Guardian interviewed four people who moved abroad: a finance graduate in Dubai, a sustainability worker in Berlin, a freelance journalist who lives as a digital nomad in Southeast Asia, and a web developer who found better pay in Vancouver. They all say the UK feels too expensive, politically tired, and offers fewer career chances."
