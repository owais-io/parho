title: "UK Government Delays Four Mayor Elections, Sparking Claims of “Cancelling Democracy”"
summary: "The UK government has decided to postpone mayoral elections in four areas – Greater Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, Hampshire and the Solent, and Sussex and Brighton – until 2028. Ministers say the delay will give local councils time to finish reorganising. Opposition parties, including the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform UK, say the move steals voters’ rights and is a political tactic. Critics call it a betrayal of democracy, while the government says funding will not be delayed."
