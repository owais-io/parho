title: "Harvard Fires Health Expert Over Palestine Work, Revealing Bigger Integrity Problem"
summary: "Harvard’s dean announced that Dr. Mary Bassett would step down as head of a human‑rights health center. In reality, she was forced out after critics, including former president Larry Summers, accused her work on Palestinian health of antisemitism. The move shows how universities back down when politics hit. Hundreds of faculty protested. Bassett will stay in another department, but the decision exposes a bigger crisis of institutional integrity and a shrinking commitment to scholarly freedom."
