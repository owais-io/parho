title: "Australia’s Power Grid Is Now Half Solar, Half Coal"
summary: "In a dramatic shift, solar panels now supply about 30 % of Australia’s main grid power and even more during sunny hours, matching coal’s contribution. The heatwave showed the system can handle high demand without blackouts, thanks to batteries and wind. Renewable energy’s share topped 50 % last quarter, cutting wholesale prices by 44 %. Still, coal plants are needed for stability, and more investment is required to keep the grid safe as old plants close."
