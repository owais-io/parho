title: "New Cars Now About £6,000 Cheaper on Average"
summary: "If you’re thinking about buying a new car, prices are dropping. Dealers are offering an average discount of about £6,000, or 11% off the on‑road price, across petrol, diesel and electric models. Electric cars get even bigger cuts, up to £7,000, because suppliers haven’t produced many cheap battery models. Competition from new Chinese brands and a push to hit EV sales targets are driving these deals. Haggling at month‑end still helps."
