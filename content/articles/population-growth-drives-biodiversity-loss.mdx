title: "Population Growth Drives Biodiversity Loss"
summary: "The UK government’s new report warns that as the world’s population rises to nearly 10 billion by 2050, the pressure on food production will grow, leading to more forest loss, pesticide use and other environmental damage that hurts wildlife. Monbiot argues that the government has ignored this link, saying we need to address population growth—through better access to family planning and encouraging plant‑based diets—to stop the loss of species and protect global security."
