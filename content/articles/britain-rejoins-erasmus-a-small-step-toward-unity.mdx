title: "Britain Rejoins Erasmus+: A Small Step Toward Unity"
summary: "After leaving the EU, Britain stopped taking part in Erasmus+, the student‑exchange programme that lets students study abroad across Europe. Now it is allowed back in, which the author sees as a hopeful but small win against growing nationalism. Erasmus+ shows how students can learn from different cultures while keeping their home identity. The writer says the programme can’t stop all nationalist feelings, but it offers a model of European unity that respects diversity."
