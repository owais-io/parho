title: "Fareham voters react to Suella Braverman’s move to Reform"
summary: "Suella Braverman, the MP for Fareham, left the Conservatives to join Reform UK. Local residents are divided: a pub owner says she never helped his business, while other voters claim she remains the same person. Neighbouring MPs and the council leader are upset that she made the move without warning. Some think a by‑election is needed, but many say they will still vote for her based on her record."
