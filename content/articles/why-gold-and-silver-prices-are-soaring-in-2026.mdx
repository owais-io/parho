title: "Why Gold and Silver Prices Are Soaring in 2026"
summary: "Last year’s run in gold and silver has accelerated in 2026. Investors are buying the metals because Trump’s tariffs, threats, and attacks on the Fed have made the dollar shaky. Central banks are buying less gold, while regular people are piling in as a “safe‑haven” asset. The price jump is also linked to a weaker dollar and market anxiety. This trend shows how political uncertainty can drive investors toward tangible assets."
