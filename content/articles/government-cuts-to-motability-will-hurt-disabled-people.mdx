title: "Government cuts to Motability will hurt disabled people"
summary: "The new budget plans cut the Motability scheme, removing a few luxury cars that only 5% of users choose and scrapping £300 million in tax relief. This means higher upfront payments, more expensive leases and fewer cars to fit power‑wheelchairs. The cuts reduce independence, not savings, and are used to boost UK car production even though the industry is largely foreign‑owned. The writer, who grew up with muscular dystrophy, laments how the changes limit essential mobility."
