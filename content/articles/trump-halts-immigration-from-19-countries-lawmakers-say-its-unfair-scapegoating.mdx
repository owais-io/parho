summary: "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services suddenly stopped processing immigration and asylum applications from 19 countries that are already under travel bans. Lawmakers and human‑rights groups say the move unfairly targets whole nationalities, especially after a shooting of two National Guard members. They argue the policy does nothing to improve safety, tears families apart, and hurts people fleeing persecution. Trump’s harsh comments about some groups add fuel to the controversy."
