title: "French Potato Chips Are Surprisingly Weird"
summary: "I spent Christmas in France, and while the towns looked charming, I discovered the supermarket crisps were oddly flavored. They had things like blue cheese, butter, and even falafel. The author jokes that the French market is as weird as UK snack experiments from last year, like gingerbread Doritos. He playfully wonders if they’ll ever make foie‑gras crisps. It’s a light‑hearted, slightly mocking look at French snack culture."
