title: "Lowering cigarette taxes may not bring smokers back from illegal trade, study says"
summary: "A new study says cutting cigarette taxes in Australia won’t necessarily lure smokers away from the illegal market or raise government revenue. High taxes that once helped curb smoking now push people to cheaper, illicit smokes. The black‑market sales have doubled, cutting tax income from $16.3bn to about $7.8bn. Lowering the tax could even make the deficit bigger unless enforcement, education and a joint effort against illegal trade are also ramped up."
