title: "FA Cup to seed top teams and skip random draw after the last 32"
summary: "The FA wants to change the Women’s FA Cup. It would seed the top four clubs from the previous season and then lay out a fixed bracket from the last 32 on to the final, like a World Cup. The idea is to make more exciting matches and raise money. Many clubs disagree, saying it hurts lower‑league teams. A vote will be taken in April after talks with clubs and fans."
