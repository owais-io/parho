title: "Should Chuck Schumer step down?"
summary: "Schumer, the Senate minority leader, is being called to resign after a 43‑day shutdown that left millions of workers unpaid and cut health‑insurance subsidies. Critics say he stuck to an imaginary couple he consults for policy and ignored public anger. Younger Democrats, including Rep. Ro Khanna, accuse him of abandoning health‑care promises and ignoring Gaza. They want him to step aside so the party can address real concerns. Schumer has so far refused to concede."
