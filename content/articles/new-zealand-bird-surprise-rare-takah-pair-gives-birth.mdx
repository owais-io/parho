title: "New Zealand Bird Surprise: Rare Takahē Pair Gives Birth"
summary: "A pair of rare New Zealand takahē birds, once thought infertile, surprised conservationists at Zealandia when a chick hatched. The baby, about seven weeks old, was found in a hidden spot inside the 10‑minute‑from‑Wellington sanctuary. Staff kept the discovery quiet to protect it. The chick looks cute and a bit dinosaur‑like, and its arrival helps boost the small, endangered takahē population. This tiny bird’s birth shows the sanctuary’s success in protecting native wildlife."
