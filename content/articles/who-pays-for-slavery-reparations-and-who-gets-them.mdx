title: "Who Pays for Slavery Reparations and Who Gets Them?"
summary: "The article argues that while there’s a strong moral push for reparations, it misses the real question: who will pay? Writers point out that ordinary workers are already struggling, so asking them to fund reparations is unrealistic. Instead, the money should come from the wealthy families and institutions that benefited from slave labor and colonial profits, many of whom hide assets offshore. A letter writer adds that India’s exploitation and cultural theft should also be included, not just the Caribbean and Africa, for a complete justice effort."
