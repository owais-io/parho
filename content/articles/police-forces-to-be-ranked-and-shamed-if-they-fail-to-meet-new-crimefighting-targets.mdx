title: "Police Forces to Be Ranked and Shamed If They Fail to Meet New Crime‑Fighting Targets"
summary: "The UK government will set new crime‑fighting targets for every police force and publish a dashboard that shows how they compare. Forces that miss targets can be overseen by a special task‑force and their chief constables can be removed. The plans aim to make policing accountable to Parliament and reduce the number of forces, but critics worry it could create wrong incentives and hurt local policing."
