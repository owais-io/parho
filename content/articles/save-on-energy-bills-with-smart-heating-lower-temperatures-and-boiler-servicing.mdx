title: "Save on energy bills with smart heating, lower temperatures, and boiler servicing"
summary: "Smart thermostats let you control heating from your phone and can save money. They cost £60‑£250, but some suppliers give discounts. Lowering the boiler setting by just a degree can cut bills by about 10%, and turning the heat off 30 minutes before leaving or sleeping also helps. Use thermostatic radiator valves to keep unused rooms cooler. Add radiator reflectors, bleed air from radiators, and have a yearly boiler service to keep it efficient."
