title: "Will Doctors Lose Support After Their Latest Strike?"
summary: "Doctors in training are striking again because they have too many applicants for too few specialty posts and are burdened by huge debt. The strikes are costing the NHS hundreds of millions and worrying patients, but past actions haven’t increased mortality. Many consultants are tired of covering for them and feel their support is fading. Some letters argue the real problem is long‑term workforce planning, not immigration or politics. A clear plan for more training posts is urgently needed."
