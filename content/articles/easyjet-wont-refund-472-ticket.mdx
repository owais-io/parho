title: "EasyJet Won’t Refund £472 Ticket"
summary: "An air‑traffic outage at Gatwick forced EasyJet to replace a large plane with a smaller one, letting 35 passengers miss their flight. The traveler was told to book a new ticket with British Airways for £472. EasyJet initially refused the refund, citing third‑party booking and a “no‑show” status. After four months and a chase, the airline eventually paid, but the process was frustrating and slow. Checking in online can help avoid such issues."
