title: "Celtic’s bad hire of Wilfried Nancy shows club chaos"
summary: "Celtic hired Wilfried Nancy as manager, but he lasted only 33 games and had no real experience. The club then changed bosses many times in one season, even sacking respected coaches and facing fan anger. Big owners and board members were criticised for their decisions. Fans and players are upset, and the club’s future feels uncertain. A new manager, Martin O’Neill, is back, but the club still needs a clear plan."
