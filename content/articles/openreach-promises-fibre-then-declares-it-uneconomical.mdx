title: "Openreach Promises Fibre, Then Declares It Uneconomical"
summary: "A homeowner in Devon was told by Openreach that full‑fibre broadband was available at his address. After a month, Openreach said the connection was uneconomical because of blocked underground conduits, so only fibre plans would be quoted. He raised the issue and Openreach found a fix, but admitted its online checker is just an indicator, not a guarantee. The company apologises and says it will work to resolve problems."
