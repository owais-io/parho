title: "UK Loses Measles‑Free Status as Cases and Deaths Rise"
summary: "The World Health Organization says the UK is no longer measles‑free after a jump in cases and deaths. In 2024, 3,681 people were reported with measles and 20 people died between 2019‑2025. The drop in the two‑dose MMR vaccine coverage – now only 83.7% for five‑year‑olds – is blamed on vaccine hesitancy and hard‑to‑get appointments. Experts say the country needs to raise coverage back to 95% to protect children."
