title: "UK and European leaders risk creating a “human‑rights hierarchy” by tightening migration rules"
summary: "The Council of Europe’s human‑rights chief warns that leaders like Keir Starmer and other European governments could turn migration laws into a “human‑rights hierarchy.” New rules might let states strip away basic protections for migrants and prisoners. A group of 27 countries is drafting a statement to narrow Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Some Labour MPs are alarmed, while others see it as a check on the court. UK stays in the ECHR."
