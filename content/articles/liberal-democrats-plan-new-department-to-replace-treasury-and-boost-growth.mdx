title: "Liberal Democrats plan new department to replace Treasury and boost growth"
summary: "Liberal Democrats have announced they want to replace the Treasury and the Department for Business with a new “Department for Growth.” The aim is to give the UK a long‑term economic plan that isn’t stuck in short‑term budgeting. The new office would be in Birmingham, away from London, and would focus on jobs, investment and living standards, while a smaller department would handle spending. The move is the party’s biggest policy shift since the election."
