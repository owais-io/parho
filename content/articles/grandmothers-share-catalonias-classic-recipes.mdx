summary: "The Catalan government’s Gastrosàvies project invites over 100 older women to film simple, traditional dishes on its website. These recipes—rice with cabbage, chicken with apple, pork chops with chestnuts—highlight local ingredients and straightforward techniques, keeping a culinary heritage that is disappearing in cities. 76‑year‑old Maria Antònia Udina shows how her farm’s cockerel and homemade sauces reflect a taste for fresh, home‑style food. The initiative hopes to inspire younger generations to cook at home instead of ordering fast food."
