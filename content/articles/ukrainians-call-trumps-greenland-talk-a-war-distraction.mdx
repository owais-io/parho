title: "Ukrainians Call Trump’s Greenland Talk a War Distraction"
summary: "Ukrainians see Trump’s talk about Greenland as a distraction from their war. In Odesa, locals compare it to Russia's invasion and worry that the issue could pull European focus away from Ukraine. Experts say the Greenland claim would hurt NATO and transatlantic solidarity, while the Kremlin uses it to justify aggression. Ukraine’s leaders and ordinary people fear Europe’s tiredness, but some hope it will push Europe to act on its own defence."
