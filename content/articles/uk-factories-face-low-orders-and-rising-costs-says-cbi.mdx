title: "UK factories face low orders and rising costs, says CBI"
summary: "British factories are still struggling because customers are hesitant and costs are high. A February survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed that orders were below average and factories expect to cut output and raise prices over the next three months. Despite some optimism about the government’s budget, workers are being laid off and small businesses face mounting bills. The government plans a £2 bn energy‑price cut, but it will start in 2027."
