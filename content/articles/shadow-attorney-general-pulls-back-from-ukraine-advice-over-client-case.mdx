title: "Shadow attorney general pulls back from Ukraine advice over client case"
summary: "Shadow attorney general David Wolfson has stopped giving Kemi Badenoch legal advice on Ukraine and Russia because he’s working on a case for Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. Wolfson’s team is trying to recover billions in frozen assets in the Channel Islands. Labour says this is a conflict of interest, while the Conservatives say it’s normal for lawyers to drop advice on cases they’re working on. The move means Wolfson cannot advise on possible UK troop deployments, but other advisers will fill in."
