title: "Chile lithium mine plan threatens local water supplies"
summary: "Rio Tinto and Chile’s state miner Codelco want to pull lithium from the Salar de Maricunga salt flat. Mining uses a lot of water, and local Indigenous people worry the water that feeds their farms and the salt flat’s unique wildlife could disappear. Only a small fraction of communities were asked for input, and they are suing to get more say. Chile’s new president plans to speed up mining, raising fears of more damage."
