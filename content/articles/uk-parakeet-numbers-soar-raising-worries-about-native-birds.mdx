title: "UK parakeet numbers soar, raising worries about native birds"
summary: "UK parakeet numbers have jumped from 5,000 in 2011 to more than 30,000 today, spreading from London parks to cities like Manchester. The bright green birds out‑number native species and may steal nesting spots and food. Studies in Belgium and Spain show mixed effects, but some native birds and bats could be at risk. The government has avoided culling because it is controversial, while Spain is already shooting, trapping and sterilising parakeets to control the rise."
