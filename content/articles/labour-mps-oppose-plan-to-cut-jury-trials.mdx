title: "Labour MPs oppose plan to cut jury trials"
summary: "Labour MPs are upset over the government's plan to reduce jury trials, saying it will take away a basic right and hurt the court backlog. About 39 MPs signed a letter calling the move “madness” and asking Prime Minister Keir Starmer to reverse it. They say the real fix is more court days and better court logistics, not limiting juries. The justice secretary says fewer jury cases could speed up the system."
