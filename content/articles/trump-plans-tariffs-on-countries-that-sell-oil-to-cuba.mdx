title: "Trump plans tariffs on countries that sell oil to Cuba"
summary: "The Trump administration has issued an executive order that could impose tariffs on any country that supplies oil to Cuba. The move is part of a larger effort to pressure the island’s communist government and cut off its main energy source, which was coming from Venezuela and Mexico. The White House says Cuba is linked to hostile groups, while Mexico’s oil company says it will keep delivering humanitarian aid. The policy could worsen Cuba’s tight fuel shortage and hurt tourism."
