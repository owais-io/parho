title: "UK forces dual citizens to pay for UK travel"
summary: "The UK has introduced new rules that take effect on 25 February. Dual citizens must now show a British passport or a “certificate of entitlement” that costs £589 when they travel to the UK on another passport. About 1.2 million people are affected. Many, especially older people, are upset and say they’ll either give up their UK citizenship or stop visiting. The government says carriers need to verify status, but critics call it unfair."
