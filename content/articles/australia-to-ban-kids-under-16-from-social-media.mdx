title: "Australia to Ban Kids Under 16 From Social Media"
summary: "Australia passed a law banning social media for kids under 16, set to start on Dec 10. The government rushed the bill through parliament, still adding platforms. Tech companies are scrambling to set up age‑verification and expect mistakes – some children could slip through, others may be wrongly blocked. Experts say the tech isn’t ready yet, but the government says it’s a best‑effort approach. Most Australians back the move, but critics worry it’s rushed and imperfect."
