title: "Sydney’s Gun Owners Hold Thousands of Firearms After Bondi Attack"
summary: "After the Bondi Beach attack that killed 15 people, the NSW government is looking at gun‑law changes. Data shows that the top 100 licence holders own more than 13,000 firearms, many of them in suburban Sydney. One of the attackers had a licence and owned six guns. New rules could cap the number of guns a person can hold, restrict licences to citizens and add a national gun database. The move faces pushback from gun owners."
