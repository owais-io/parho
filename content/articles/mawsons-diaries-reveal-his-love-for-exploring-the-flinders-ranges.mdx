summary: "Douglas Mawson, famous for surviving a 1912 Antarctic disaster, also spent decades exploring South Australia’s Flinders Ranges. A volunteer team has spent 20 years decoding his messy, old‑fashioned handwriting to digitise 31 diaries from 1906‑1950s. The project includes Mawson’s grandson and others who painstakingly translate his shorthand and archaic words. They’re almost finished, giving new insight into his lesser‑known Australian adventures and the areas he helped protect."
