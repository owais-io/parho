title: "Lord Shrewsbury gets a two‑week ban for claiming false expenses"
summary: "A Conservative hereditary peer, the Earl of Shrewsbury, was suspended for two weeks after the House of Lords found he had claimed public money for travel he didn’t take and for a board meeting of a company he works for. This is his second breach, after a nine‑month ban for lobbying. Campaigners say the punishment is too light and that peers who keep breaking the rules need stronger consequences."
