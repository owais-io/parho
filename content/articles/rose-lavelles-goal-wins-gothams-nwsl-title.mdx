title: "Rose Lavelle's goal wins Gotham's NWSL title"
summary: "Rose Lavelle scored the winning goal in a 1‑0 NWSL final, giving Gotham FC its second championship. The game against the Washington Spirit went to a neutral venue, and a Spirit defender’s injury opened space for Lavelle to fire a left‑foot shot past the keeper. Gotham had been an underdog last season after a late‑season slump, but the team’s recent signings and strong play turned the tide. The win solidifies Gotham’s status as a two‑time champion."
