title: "UK Plans New National Police Service to Tackle Serious Crime"
summary: "The UK government will create a National Police Service, nicknamed the “British FBI,” to fight organised crime, terrorism, fraud and online child abuse. It will replace the National Crime Agency and regional units, using advanced tech and national talent. Local police can then focus on smaller, community crimes. The move has supporters who say it modernises policing, and critics who worry about privacy and whether frontline officers were consulted. The service will roll out in stages."
