title: "Seal Up Close While Paddling on the River Dart"
summary: "It was a calm early morning on the River Dart, so the writer paddled a stand‑up board up the river. The water was slow, but then it turned into a fast, leaf‑filled current. While he was moving, a grey seal came right up close—less than a paddle‑length away. He saw its whiskers, flaring nostrils, and smooth back. He didn’t take a photo and kept paddling."
