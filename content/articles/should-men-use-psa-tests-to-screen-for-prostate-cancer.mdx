title: "Should Men Use PSA Tests to Screen for Prostate Cancer?"
summary: "The UK’s screening committee says PSA tests are not good for most men because they miss some cancers and flag many harmless ones. Over a million people have received unnecessary surgery or radiation. Studies show that early treatment doesn’t lower death rates but can cause serious side‑effects like incontinence and erectile problems. Experts call for better tests and treatments before routine screening is used again."
