title: "Almost a quarter of UK GPs see infants and toddlers with obesity"
summary: "A survey of 540 UK GPs found that almost one in four doctors see infants and toddlers with obesity, and nearly half see kids up to seven. Eighty per cent say it’s hard to talk with parents about a child’s weight because it can make them upset or ashamed. Doctors urge early prevention, healthier food, and better support for families. They also warn that many adults are buying weight‑loss drugs illegally, putting their health at risk."
