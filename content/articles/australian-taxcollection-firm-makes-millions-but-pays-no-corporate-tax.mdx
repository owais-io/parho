title: "Australian tax‑collection firm makes millions but pays no corporate tax"
summary: "A private company called Recoveriescorp, hired by the Australian Taxation Office to chase unpaid taxes, earned over $100 million in 2025 yet reports no tax due. Its parent company, Symbos Bidco, shows large consulting fees and high‑interest loans that keep profits negative, so nothing is owed to the tax office. While there's no proof of wrongdoing, the deal raises questions about government procurement rules and tax‑paying thresholds."
