title: "Bondi shooting forces Australia to rethink its gun laws"
summary: "Australia’s strict gun laws, set after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, helped cut gun numbers and earned praise worldwide. But a recent shooting at Bondi Beach shows weaknesses: one gunman owned six legal firearms and more guns are now on the streets, with 4 million in the country and 2,000 new ones each week. The rules still vary by state, a national register hasn’t been set up, and new threats like 3‑D‑printed weapons add to the challenge."
