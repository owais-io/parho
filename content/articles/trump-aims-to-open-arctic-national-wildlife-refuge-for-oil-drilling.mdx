title: "Trump Aims to Open Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for Oil Drilling"
summary: "Trump’s administration wants to start oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a big, wildlife‑rich area in northern Alaska. The plan involves selling leases for millions of acres and follows moves that cut conservation and climate research. Environmental groups say drilling would hurt polar bears, wolves, caribou, and many birds, and could speed Arctic warming. The move shows the US still prioritizes energy over protecting the planet."
