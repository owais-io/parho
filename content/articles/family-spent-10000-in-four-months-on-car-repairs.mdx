title: "Family Spent $10,000 in Four Months on Car Repairs"
summary: "Emergency car problems can wipe out family savings. A WhatsApp group of 10 parents told Guardian journalists that almost all had an unexpected car expense this year, some spending up to $10,000 in four months. Most U.S. households use cars daily, and many lack reliable public transport, so a broken vehicle forces new purchases or long repairs. The costs, plus rising gas and insurance, left families delaying trips, cutting holiday gifts, and tightening budgets."
