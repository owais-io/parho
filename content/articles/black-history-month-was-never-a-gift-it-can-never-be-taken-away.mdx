title: "Black History Month Was Never a Gift – It Can Never Be Taken Away"
summary: "Many people think Black History Month was handed to us, but it actually started in Black churches and schools after the Civil War. Historians like Carter Woodson turned a week of learning into a national month in the 1970s. Over the years the holiday has faced push‑back, corporate commercialism, and attempts to erase its roots in resistance. The story reminds us that Black communities created the month and can’t let anyone steal its meaning."
