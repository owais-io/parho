title: "Foreign doctors leave NHS because of anti‑immigration attitudes, says top medical leader"
summary: "Foreign doctors and nurses are quitting the NHS, says the head of the doctors’ union, because people in the UK are saying immigration is bad and that migrants are unwanted. The NHS now relies on many overseas workers – about 40% of doctors trained abroad – so losing them could hurt the service. Racial abuse from patients and staff, and the government’s focus on UK graduates, make many international doctors feel unsafe and unwelcome."
