title: "Team GB Can Still Secure Winter Olympic Medals After a Rough Start"
summary: "Team GB arrived at Milano‑Cortina with high hopes, but early events have left them short of medals. Four fourth‑place finishes in 24 hours have dampened spirits, and the chef de mission, Eve Muirhead, is urging positivity. Still, many athletes posted personal bests, and Britain still has strong chances in skeleton, snowboard cross, curling, and other events. With 12 days left, a medal rebound is possible."
