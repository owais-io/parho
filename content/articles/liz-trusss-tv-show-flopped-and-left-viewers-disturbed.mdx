title: "Liz Truss's TV Show Flopped and Left Viewers Disturbed"
summary: "Truss tried to turn a spare room into a TV studio, but the show fell apart. Guests included conspiracy theorists and a teenager on drugs, and the host rammed out attacks on foreigners, the monarchy, and even the Queen's death. The jokes were off‑kilter, editing was bad, and the content made viewers uncomfortable. Critics called it a disaster and said it left people feeling more stressed than before."
