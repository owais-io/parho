title: "Senate Passes Funding Bill, Holds Off on ICE Money After Minneapolis Killings"
summary: "The U.S. Senate approved a government funding package that will keep federal agencies open until September. The deal was reached after two U.S. citizens were killed by ICE agents in Minneapolis, forcing Democrats to push for reforms. The package leaves out new money for ICE, instead demanding body‑cams and other rules. The bill still needs the House’s approval; a brief shutdown could happen if it’s delayed."
