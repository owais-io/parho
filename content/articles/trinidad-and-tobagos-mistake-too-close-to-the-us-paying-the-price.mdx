title: "Trinidad and Tobago’s mistake: Too close to the U.S., paying the price"
summary: "Trinidad and Tobago has put itself in danger by siding too closely with the United States after the U.S. attacked Venezuela. The move has made the country look like a tool of Washington and earned it a hostile neighbour who now calls the island's prime minister persona non grata. Without strong ties to other Caribbean nations, the island risks losing oil and gas deals worth more than $1 billion a year and faces economic, political and social fallout."
