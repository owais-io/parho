title: "US Homeland Security Partially Shut Down After Funding Fight"
summary: "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has started a partial shutdown because Congress couldn’t agree on funding. Services like the TSA, Secret Service and FEMA could lose staff and money, while ICE and CBP are likely to stay funded from last year’s bill. Democrats want new rules on immigration enforcement after killings in Minnesota, but Republicans blocked extra money. The shutdown may stretch past the weekend and hurt disaster response."
