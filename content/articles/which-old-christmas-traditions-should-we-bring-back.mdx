title: "Which old Christmas traditions should we bring back?"
summary: "Readers suggest bringing back old Christmas customs. Ideas include wassailing—drinking door‑to‑door for good harvests—calling the holiday Yule, keeping lights and trees up longer, and returning Santa’s green costume. Some want to stop buying online gifts, cut back on repetitive Christmas music, and bring back the twelve nights of celebration instead of weeks. Others ask for more honest, low‑cost holidays and a return to ancient feasts, green lights, and simple family time."
