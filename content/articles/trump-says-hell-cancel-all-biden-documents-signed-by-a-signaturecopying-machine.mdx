title: "Trump says he'll cancel all Biden documents signed by a signature‑copying machine"
summary: "On Tuesday, Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would void every document Biden signed using an autopen, a machine that copies a signature. He said the documents—including pardons—are now invalid. Lawyers say presidents don’t need to hand‑write such documents and there is no law letting a president cancel another’s pardons. Trump’s claim is unlikely to hold up, and it may affect high‑profile pardons Biden issued."
