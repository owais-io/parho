title: "Trump’s Gaza Plan Seeks to End Extremist Goals, but Faces Big Tests"
summary: "Donald Trump’s new peace board presented a plan for Gaza that would give the area a single Palestinian government, end Hamas weapons, and rebuild basic services. The plan includes opening the Rafah crossing and letting a Palestinian police force take control. Israel’s far‑right opposition and questions about when the army will leave the strip make the plan hard to execute. The real test comes next week when Rafah reopens."
