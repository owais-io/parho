title: "Lapwings Return: A Childhood Bird Reappears"
summary: "The article is a personal recollection of spotting lapwings again after years of absence. The writer describes how these black‑and‑white birds used to be common on their farm, how their bright plumage and clever “broken‑wing” trick fascinated her and her dad, and how the birds were once hunted even though they were protected. Habitat loss has pushed lapwings away, but a new flock now flutters across the field, bringing a touch of childhood joy back."
