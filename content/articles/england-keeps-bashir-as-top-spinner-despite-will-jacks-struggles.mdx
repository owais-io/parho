title: "England keeps Bashir as top spinner despite Will Jacks struggles"
summary: "England decided to keep Shoaib Bashir as the number one spin bowler, even though they dropped him for the third Test in Adelaide and Will Jacks didn’t perform well. After day three, with Australia close to a 3‑0 lead, assistant coach Jeetan Patel said Bashir was left out to give extra batting help, but it backfired. Jacks took only six wickets for 212 runs, and the team struggled. Patel praised Bashir’s past work and said the plan didn't work today."
