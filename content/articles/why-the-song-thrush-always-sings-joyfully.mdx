title: "Why the Song Thrush Always Sings Joyfully"
summary: "At dawn, the author hears a song thrush singing brightly through his bedroom window. The thrush’s song is simple, repeating cheerful phrases that make it easy to learn. Though it repeats, the bird’s repertoire actually contains about 130 different tunes and mimics other birds. The author reflects on how the thrush’s joyful song, popular in polls, could mask unease if the seasons shift. But for now, it simply brings happiness."
