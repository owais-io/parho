title: "Heatwave in Australia Shows the Fault in Its Fossil‑Fuel Policy"
summary: "Australia’s recent heatwave turned a scorching, record‑breaking summer into a stark reminder of the country’s fossil‑fuel contradictions. Temperatures climbed above 45 °C in Melbourne and even higher in rural towns, sparking bushfires that have already scorched over 400,000 hectares. A new study says the heat is five times more likely because of human‑made warming, yet media and politicians still rarely mention it. Meanwhile, the government keeps opening new gas and coal projects, blurring its climate‑change promises."
