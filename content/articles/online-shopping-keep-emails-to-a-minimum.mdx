title: "Online Shopping: Keep Emails to a Minimum"
summary: "When I buy something online, I want just two emails: one to confirm the order and one to tell me when it will arrive. Instead, I get a flood of messages that feel like harassment. From push‑to‑buy notifications to cashback offers and rating requests, the constant bombardment is annoying and intrusive. I’m asking retailers to cut back—just give me the basics and leave me alone."
