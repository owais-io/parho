title: "Australian Tax Office Starts New $5.3 billion Debt Collection Drive"
summary: "The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has kicked off a fresh campaign to recover $5.3 billion from more than 325,000 taxpayers, mainly individuals and small businesses. These “on‑hold” debts date back to 2017 and were hidden from people for years. Most owe only about $1,470, but a few owe huge sums. The ATO will now show the debts on tax accounts, cut them from future refunds, and start charging interest after six months. The move follows criticism of the earlier “robotax” scheme, and the ATO says it will communicate more clearly with taxpayers."
