title: "Christmas Cranberries Are a Signal of Climate Change and Rising Food Costs"
summary: "This week we look at why Christmas food is more expensive. Most cranberries we eat are imported, and their price has jumped because of war, higher energy costs and supply problems. Climate change also hurts growers – hot weather and floods damage crops. A bigger worry is wheat, the main grain for bread and cakes, which has seen record‑low harvests. Experts say shortages and poor supply could even spark unrest. The article urges policy changes and smarter food choices."
