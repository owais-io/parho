summary: "The UK’s economy grew just 0.1 % in the last quarter of last year, and 1.3 % for the year—slightly better than 2024 but still slow. Labour says conditions are right for growth, and the Bank of England may cut rates again to help inflation and business spending. Investors see construction still weak, and a recent rise in employer national insurance added to worries. Policymakers hope rate cuts and lower energy bills will ease consumer spending."
