title: "Oil Prices Spike as US‑Iran Tensions Rise Ahead of Nuclear Talks"
summary: "Oil prices jumped to a seven‑month high as worries over a possible conflict between the United States and Iran climbed ahead of their nuclear talks. Traders pushed U.S. crude up to $67.28 a barrel and Brent to $72.50. Analysts say the rise reflects a risk premium for a potential war, not real supply cuts. Both sides are still preparing for a third round of talks in Geneva, while the U.S. has moved more ships into the region."
