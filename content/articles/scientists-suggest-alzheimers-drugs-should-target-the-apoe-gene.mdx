title: "Scientists suggest Alzheimer’s drugs should target the ApoE gene"
summary: "Researchers say that most Alzheimer’s cases come from two harmful versions of the ApoE gene. If drugs could stop those versions from working, they could prevent most of the disease. Current medicines that clear brain proteins only help a little and aren’t widely used. While the idea is exciting, it would mean treating almost everyone and would need risky gene‑editing work. Scientists are still debating the best approach."
