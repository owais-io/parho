title: "Is the mansion tax fair or unfair?"
summary: "People have written letters arguing about the new “mansion tax.” Some say the tax unfairly hits hardworking middle‑class families who have saved to buy homes and should be rewarded for their effort. Others point out that those with expensive houses are already privileged and that the tax is a small burden. A few writers note the gap between wealthy tax worries and the poverty faced by many. The letters show the debate is wide and mixed."
