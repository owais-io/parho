summary: "In 2023, economists warned that over $70 trillion of inherited wealth will move from one generation to the next in the next ten years, widening global inequality. In the UK, new inheritance tax rules are making families rethink how and when they hand over assets. The Guardian asks readers whether they expect to inherit money, how it might help them, or if it’s irrelevant, and whether tax changes have altered their plans."
