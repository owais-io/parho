title: "Iran protests become more masculinist, different from 2022 hijab movement"
summary: "Iran’s latest protests look very different from the 2022 hijab movement. Women’s slogan “woman, life, freedom” barely rang out. Instead, many chants praised Reza Pahlavi, a former royal, and called for a “new fight.” The unrest is driven by rising poverty and anger at the rial’s fall. Police killed thousands, and the government’s brutal crackdown threatens the regime’s survival in the last weeks."

Iran’s latest protests look very different from the 2022 hijab movement. Women’s slogan “woman, life, freedom” barely rang out. Instead, many chants praised Reza Pahlavi, a former royal, and called for a “new fight.” The unrest is driven by rising poverty and anger at the rial’s fall. Police killed thousands, and the government’s brutal crackdown threatens the regime’s survival in the last weeks.
