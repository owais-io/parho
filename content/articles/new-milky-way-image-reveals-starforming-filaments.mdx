title: "New Milky Way Image Reveals Star‑Forming Filaments"
summary: "Scientists used the ALMA radio telescope in Chile to take the largest ever picture of our galaxy’s heart. The photo shows long, thin filaments of gas that feed star and planet formation, a surprise that helps explain how early galaxies worked. The study gives a clearer map of the Milky Way’s centre, where scientists can compare gas clouds and newborn stars. They hope to add data from the James Webb Space Telescope to see even more detail."
