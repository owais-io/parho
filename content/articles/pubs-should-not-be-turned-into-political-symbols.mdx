title: "Pubs Should Not Be Turned into Political Symbols"
summary: "Jonathan Liew explains how the hard‑right party Reform UK is using pubs as a political toy, promising tax breaks to keep them alive. He says this idea relies on a narrow view of pubs as places for old white men. Real pubs are varied – from gastropubs to LGBTQ+ bars – and they serve all kinds of people. Liew warns that policy changes could make pubs more uniform and less welcoming to everyone."
