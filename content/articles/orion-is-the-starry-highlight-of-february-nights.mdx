title: "Orion Is the Starry Highlight of February Nights"
summary: "Orion, a famous constellation, is easy to spot in February nights. From the UK it rises in the east after sunset, peaks south around 9‑10 p.m., and sets after midnight. Look for its three-star belt, then follow the line to see bright stars like Betelgeuse and Rigel. Orion is visible from both hemispheres, making it a great guide for amateur stargazers."
