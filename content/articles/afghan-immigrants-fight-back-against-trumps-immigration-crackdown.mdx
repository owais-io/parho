title: "Afghan Immigrants Fight Back Against Trump’s Immigration Crackdown"
summary: "Afghan immigrants in the U.S. and their supporters are loudly opposing the Trump administration’s latest immigration crackdown, which followed a shooting that blamed an Afghan asylum seeker. The government has frozen asylum approvals, stopped visa and green‑card processing for 19 countries, and re‑examined visas already granted. Afghans say they have fought for U.S. values and are being unfairly punished. Officials claim safety is the reason, but many fear losing their legal status and living in uncertainty."
