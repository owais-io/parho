title: "Chancellor backs down on pub tax hike, averting party revolt"
summary: "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she will change her plans to raise pub business rates, after pubs and Labour MPs protested. The original budget would have made rates jump 76% in three years, a big hit for owners. Reeves is now working on a support package that could lower those rates and ease other rules. Labour MPs were ready to push a bill amendment if the new plan isn’t enough. The move stops an immediate rebellion in Parliament."
