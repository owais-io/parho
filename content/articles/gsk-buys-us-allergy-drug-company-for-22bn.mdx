title: "GSK buys U.S. allergy drug company for $2.2bn"
summary: "GSK, Britain’s second‑largest drugmaker, agreed to buy RAPT Therapeutics for $2.2bn. RAPT is working on a new medicine called ozureprubart that could treat severe food allergies like peanut, milk and egg. The drug would need to be injected only every 12 weeks, a big improvement over current treatments that are given every few weeks. If trials succeed, the medicine could launch around 2031 and become a big seller for GSK."
