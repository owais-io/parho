title: "Poland trains half a million people for war as Russia threatens"
summary: "Poland is training 400,000 citizens in survival skills, bomb‑shelter use, and drone‑defense drills because of growing Russian threats. The government will raise defence spending to 4.8% of GDP, build an “eastern shield” along its borders with Belarus and Kaliningrad, and upgrade old shelters. Soldiers practice hybrid warfare, such as drone attacks and illegal migration, while some locals hope the war never comes."
