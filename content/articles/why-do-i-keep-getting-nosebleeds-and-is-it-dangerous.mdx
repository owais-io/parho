title: "Why do I keep getting nosebleeds and is it dangerous?"
summary: "Most nosebleeds come from the front of the nose and are usually harmless. Common causes include dry air, nose‑picking, allergies, and exercise. A deeper bleed can be serious, especially for older people or those on blood thinners. If you bleed more than a few times a week, it lasts longer than 30 minutes, or only one nostril bleeds, see a doctor. At home, sit up, pinch the nose, use a cold compress or saline spray to stop the flow."
