title: "India Cancels Order to Pre‑Install State Security App on Phones"
summary: "India’s telecom ministry scrapped an order that would have forced every phone in the country to come with a state‑run security app called Sanchar Saathi. The move came after a wave of protests from privacy groups and big tech firms like Apple and Google, who said the app could be used to spy on users. The government said the app is safe and optional, and it has now been reversed."
