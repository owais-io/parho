title: "Pornhub will block new UK users from 2 February"
summary: "Pornhub will block new users in the UK from 2 February because the Online Safety Act’s age‑verification rules hurt its traffic. The company says the checks are hard to enforce, drive people to VPNs and dark sites, and risk privacy. Existing users who are already verified can still log in, but anyone new will be denied. Ofcom says porn sites must use age checks or shut down in the UK."
