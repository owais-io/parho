title: "How Europe Can Beat Populist Parties and Help the Poor"
summary: "Europe is facing a rise in nationalist parties that promise to protect blue‑collar workers but actually threaten the social safety net. The Guardian argues that politicians must focus on everyday worries like jobs, housing and pensions instead of just fighting democracy. To stay strong, the EU needs more defence money, better roads and a shared budget, and must raise taxes on the rich. If governments ignore these steps, populists will win and the poor will suffer."
