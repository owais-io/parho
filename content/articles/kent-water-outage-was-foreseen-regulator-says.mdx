title: "Kent Water Outage Was Foreseen, Regulator Says"
summary: "South East Water cut off drinking water for 24,000 homes in Tunbridge Wells after a treatment plant failed. The regulator says the failure was noticed weeks earlier and could have been avoided with proper testing and a missing filter. The plant's main chemical stopped working, and the company used outdated data collection. The regulator could not punish the company further because it had already warned residents."
