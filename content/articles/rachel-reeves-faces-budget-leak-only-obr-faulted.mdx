title: "Rachel Reeves Faces Budget Leak, Only OBR Faulted"
summary: "Rachel Reeves’ pre‑budget chaos was worsened when the Office for Budget Responsibility accidentally posted the entire budget online. Reeves blamed the OBR and tried to calm the situation, but her own speech was full of previously leaked plans and had no surprises. Critics, including Kemi Badenoch, attacked her for missing promises and for lack of clear strategy. The budget ended up being seen as another routine political move, not a fresh vision."
