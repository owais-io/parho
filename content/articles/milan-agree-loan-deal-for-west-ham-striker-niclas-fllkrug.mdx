title: "Milan Agree Loan Deal for West Ham Striker Niclas Füllkrug"
summary: "Milan have agreed to bring West Ham’s German striker Niclas Füllkrug on loan, with the option to buy after the season. The move should let West Ham free up money for new signings as they fight relegation. Their boss, Nuno Espírito Santo, still wants a proven Premier League striker, but the price tag on Wolves’ Jørgen Strand Larsen is too high. With only one senior striker left, West Ham are looking hard for options."
