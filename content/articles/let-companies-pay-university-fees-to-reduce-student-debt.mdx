title: "Let Companies Pay University Fees to Reduce Student Debt"
summary: "Students take on huge loans because universities are funded to teach what people want, not what the job market needs. A new proposal says firms should pay their graduates’ tuition directly. This would help universities offer courses that match employer demand, cut student debt, and save taxpayers money. The idea is backed by economists and could also boost apprenticeship programs, giving young people better work‑ready training."
