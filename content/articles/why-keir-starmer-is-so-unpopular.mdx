title: "Why Keir Starmer Is So Unpopular"
summary: "Keir Starmer’s favourability has plunged to record lows, with polls putting his net approval at -50 to -57. Voters blame him for failing to deliver Labour’s promised change, for making big‑ticket mistakes, and for seeming privileged and unemotional. Social media has amplified scorn, and even some Labour MPs admit that voters want a different face. The dislike may stay or lift after a recent dip, but many still view him as a weak leader."
