title: "Australia’s Social Media Ban Lets Kids Play More and Parents Take Back Control"
summary: "Australia has just introduced a law that blocks people under 16 from using social media apps. The rollout is still buggy, so some kids still have access. Parents and the prime minister hope the ban will push teens to spend more time outside and read. The government enjoys strong support, but critics say the law is too blunt and that consultation was rushed. The author’s son switched his phone to a bike after the ban, showing the change."
