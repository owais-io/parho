title: "Trump Administration Uses Pop Music in ICE Propaganda Videos"
summary: "Trump’s social‑media team has been using pop songs in videos that show ICE agents arresting immigrants, turning them into memes. Artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Taylor Swift have publicly condemned the use of their music, saying it supports a cruel policy. Their protests, however, bring more attention to the videos, which the White House then defends. The cycle feels like a no‑win situation for musicians."
