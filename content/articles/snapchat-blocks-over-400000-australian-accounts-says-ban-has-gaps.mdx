title: "Snapchat Blocks Over 400,000 Australian Accounts, Says Ban Has Gaps"
summary: "Snapchat has shut down more than 415,000 Australian accounts that were identified as belonging to users under 16, as part of the country’s new age‑ban law. The company says its age‑checking tools—mainly facial recognition—are not perfect, so some young people can still get past the ban and some adults may be mistakenly locked. It warns that teens could switch to other apps that aren’t regulated and calls for stronger age‑verification at app‑store level."
