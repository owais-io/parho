title: "Huge ancient kangaroos could have hopped, scientists find"
summary: "Scientists studied fossils of giant kangaroos that weighed up to 250 kg and found that their legs and tendons were strong enough to let them hop. The research looked at the bones and tendons of several species that lived between 13,000 and 40,000 years ago. While the kangaroos might not have hopped long distances, the findings show hopping was mechanically possible, giving new clues about how these massive animals moved."
