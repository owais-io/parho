title: "UK offshore wind auction wins at cheaper prices, but still raises consumer costs"
summary: "The latest UK offshore wind auction delivered contracts around £91 per megawatt hour for 8.4 GW of new capacity, beating earlier forecasts. While this is lower than the projected “cost‑neutral” £94/MWh, it’s still higher than the current market price of £81/MWh and represents a 17 % inflation jump from 2024. Long‑term contracts and rising borrowing costs mean the savings for households will be modest until the 2040s. The government says hitting the 2030 clean‑energy target is not critical."
