summary: "France finally passed this year’s budget after its minority government survived two no‑confidence votes. The deal was made when the Socialist party agreed not to oppose the budget in return for pausing pension reforms. The budget raises defence spending by €6.5 bn and aims to cut the deficit to 5 % of GDP by 2026. Political chaos has stalled other reforms and leaves the country preparing for municipal and 2027 presidential elections."
