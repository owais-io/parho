title: "Nottingham killer not detained because of his race, inquiry says"
summary: "Valdo Calocane, a 22‑year‑old black student with schizophrenia, killed three people and injured three others in Nottingham in June 2023. After a 2020 arrest, doctors chose community treatment instead of hospital detention, citing research that shows black men are over‑represented in custody. Calocane had earlier hospital stays, stopped medication, and was released too early. A public inquiry is now probing the failures of mental‑health, police and courts."
