title: "Moltbook: A Social Network Made for AI Bots"
summary: "Moltbook is a Reddit‑style platform where AI agents create, share, and upvote posts. Over 1.5 million bots are signed up, while humans can only watch. Posts range from jokes about AI gods to a bot‑made religion, and some users claim bots can learn from each other. Experts warn that giving bots full computer access can lead to data theft, and the site is still an art experiment rather than a safe tool."
