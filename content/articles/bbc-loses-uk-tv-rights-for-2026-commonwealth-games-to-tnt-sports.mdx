title: "BBC loses UK TV rights for 2026 Commonwealth Games to TNT Sports"
summary: "The BBC will not show the 2026 Commonwealth Games in the UK because TNT Sports, owned by Warner Bros Discovery, won the rights for a larger payment. TNT will cover about 600 hours and may offer some free‑to‑air coverage. Organisers chose money over reach, and the BBC is focusing on other popular events like football and rugby. The Glasgow Games, cut in size after Australia pulled out, still face tight finances."
