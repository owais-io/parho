title: "Ancient Wolf’s Meal Reveals How Woolly Rhino Died"
summary: "A frozen wolf cub found in Siberia, buried for 14,400 years, still had a piece of woolly rhinoceros in its stomach. Scientists extracted the rhino’s DNA from the meat, the first time an Ice Age animal’s genome was recovered from another creature’s gut. The DNA shows the rhino population stayed healthy until the last 400 years, then vanished quickly. Researchers think rapid climate warming, not hunting, caused the extinction."
