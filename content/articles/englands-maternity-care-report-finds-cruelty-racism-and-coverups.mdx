summary: "A new report on England’s maternity services shows disturbing problems. Staff have made cruel, insensitive comments to grieving families, and Black and Asian women reported racist stereotypes. Hospitals have also hidden mistakes, altered patient records, and failed to give clear explanations after accidents. The report points to chronic staff shortages and poor facilities, like leaking roofs, that leave nurses overworked.
