title: "UK plans could make 300,000 children wait 10 years for permanent residency"
summary: "The IPPR think‑tank says a new UK immigration rule could make over 300,000 children who already live in Britain wait ten years before they can claim permanent residency. The change would double the usual five‑year path to settlement and even push it to 15 years for people in low‑skill jobs. MPs argue that the rule applies retroactively and would hurt families’ chances of going to university, getting benefits and avoiding child poverty."
