title: "Trump’s Greenland tariff threat could spark global trade war, IMF says"
summary: "The IMF says Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Greenland could start a trade war that hurts the global economy. It would make markets jittery and hurt families on both sides of the Atlantic. The risk of a “spiral of escalation” could push up prices and slow growth. Tech investment has helped keep growth steady, but a full‑blown trade fight could undo that."
