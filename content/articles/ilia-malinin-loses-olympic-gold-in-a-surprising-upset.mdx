title: "Ilia Malinin Loses Olympic Gold in a Surprising Upset"
summary: "Ilia Malinin entered the 2024 Olympic men's skating event as the clear favorite, holding a five‑point lead after the short program. But in the free skate he missed several high‑value jumps, fell, and had to improvise, losing a lot of base value. The scoring system penalized each mistake, and a clean performance from Kazakhstan’s Alexander Shaidorov lifted him to gold. The upset shows that even the toughest technical skater can lose if the program breaks down."
