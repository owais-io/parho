title: "Wes Streeting Should Look at Overdiagnosis in Mental Health"
summary: "John Harris says Wes Streeting’s mental‑health review is just a political stunt, but the writer disagrees. He says mental‑health services, especially for children, are stretched thin and an inquiry is needed. Overdiagnosis is a real concern for clinicians, not a political hack. Harris also ignores work that argues diagnosis should help patients, not just label them. The piece notes ADHD may be underdiagnosed, and calls for balanced, evidence‑based reviews."
