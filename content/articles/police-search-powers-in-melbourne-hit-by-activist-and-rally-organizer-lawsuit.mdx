title: "Police search powers in Melbourne hit by activist and rally organizer lawsuit"
summary: "An activist named Benny Zable and a First Nations rally organizer, Tarneen Onus Browne, have taken a federal court case against Victoria police. The case challenges a 6‑month declaration that lets police stop and search anyone in the CBD, Docklands, Southbank, and nearby areas without a warrant.
