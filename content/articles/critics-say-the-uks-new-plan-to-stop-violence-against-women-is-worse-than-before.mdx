title: "Critics say the UK’s new plan to stop violence against women is worse than before"
summary: "Many charities and experts say the government’s new strategy to cut violence against women and girls is disorganised and has ignored frontline advice. They claim the plan, delayed until autumn, focuses on preventing radicalisation in boys but lacks expert input and clear accountability. Ministers have rushed to publish the draft before Christmas, raising fears the policy will be watered down. Supporters want more funding, better law changes, and a clear way to monitor progress."
