title: "Truck fire on NSW highway blocks traffic for days"
summary: "Truck carrying 15 tonnes of lithium batteries caught fire near Yass on the Hume Highway. The blaze forced a 700‑metre block and shut the motorway in both directions for about six hours, as firefighters feared toxic gases from the batteries. Traffic was rerouted through contraflow lanes, and the road remains closed for several days while the fire is allowed to burn out. No one was hurt, and the incident isn’t believed to be arson."
