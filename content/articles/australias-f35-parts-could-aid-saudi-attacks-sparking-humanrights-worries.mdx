title: "Australia’s F‑35 parts could aid Saudi attacks, sparking human‑rights worries"
summary: "When President Trump announced a deal to sell 48 F‑35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia, he used parts that are made in Australia. More than 70 Australian companies build critical pieces, and 700 of those parts are made in Victoria. Experts worry that the jets could be used in Saudi attacks on Yemen and that Australia could be complicit. The U.S. export rules are weak, and the Australian government has little control over where the parts go."
