title: "Can You Solve It? Get Ready for 2026"
summary: "The article looks back at 2025, pointing out that it is a perfect square (45²) and that the digits 20 and 25 add up to 45. It then invites readers to solve a puzzle for the number 26, giving an example that uses six 1s: (1+1)×(1+1+11). Readers are challenged to find similar equations with other digits, like five 9s or six 7s. The author asks for solutions later and encourages sharing thoughts on the number 26."
