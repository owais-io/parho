title: "Labour’s Starmer Can’t Win Gorton and Denton"
summary: "Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, is struggling to win the Gorton and Denton by‑election. His party has pushed left‑wing members out and is now only fighting the right, especially Reform UK. In the diverse constituency, the Green candidate, a local plumber, has the most support, while Labour is down to 21%. Voters feel Labour is too focused on blocking right‑wing parties and not offering real change."
