title: "Conservative legal group plans to spread its agenda overseas"
summary: "Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is a conservative US legal group that has poured $10.9 million into international work this year, mainly in Europe. They say they defend religious freedom, but watchdogs say they target LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and free speech for minorities. ADF has helped a Finnish MP in a free‑speech case, backed anti‑abortion activists in the UK, and even met with Nigel Farage. Critics warn that ADF is spreading a hard‑right Christian agenda abroad."
