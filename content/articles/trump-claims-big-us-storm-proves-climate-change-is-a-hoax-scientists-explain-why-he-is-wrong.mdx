title: "Trump Claims Big U.S. Storm Proves Climate Change Is a Hoax – Scientists Explain Why He Is Wrong"
summary: "Trump says a huge winter storm proves global warming is a hoax. He posted this on Truth Social, but scientists point out the storm is caused by a polar vortex shift and Arctic warming, not a lack of climate change. One storm doesn’t prove long‑term trends. In reality, winter cold snaps have shortened and record hot days are outnumbering cold days across the U.S."
