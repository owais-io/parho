title: "UK Ministers Take $1 Million from Meta to Fund AI Projects Amid Social‑Media Ban Talk"
summary: "UK ministers have accepted a £728,000 ($1 million) donation from Meta to hire four AI experts who will help upgrade transport, police, and national security systems. The money comes as the government consults on banning social‑media use for under‑16s. Critics say the deal shows the UK’s too‑close relationship with US tech giants and could give Meta too much influence. Meta also partnered with AI firm Anthropic for a public‑service assistant."
