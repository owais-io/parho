title: "Find Aries, the Winter Ram Constellation"
summary: "Aries is a small, faint constellation that looks best in the deep winter. It sits between Taurus and Pisces and can be spotted from the northern hemisphere during the cold months. The brightest stars are Hamal and Sheratan, but they’re still dim, so the moon helps light it up. On Dec 29, a nearly full moon will highlight Aries, making it easier to find."
