title: "School Phone Rules Cost Teachers Over 100 Hours a Week"
summary: "A new study shows that English secondary schools spend over 100 hours a week policing phones, using up the work of teachers, aides, and reception staff. Researchers looked at 20 schools – 13 with strict phone‑free rules and 7 with more relaxed ones. Even the stricter rules cost about 3 full‑time staff per week, and the relaxed ones cost 94 pounds more per pupil each year. The study urges a clear, law‑based ban and extra funding."
