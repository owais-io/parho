title: "Stroll Along Whin Sill’s Wild Coast"
summary: "After a big storm, waves were huge along Whin Sill’s cliffs. The jagged dolerite rock looks like giant columns that were formed 295 million years ago when magma pushed up between older rocks. A coastal walk shows the wind‑torn scrub, bright lichens, and scattered flowers. Birds like fulmars and kittiwakes nest on the ledges, adding sound to the dramatic scenery. It’s a thrilling, chilly adventure for anyone who loves nature."
