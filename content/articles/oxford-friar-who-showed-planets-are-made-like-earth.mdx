title: "Oxford Friar Who Showed Planets Are Made Like Earth"
summary: "About 800 years ago, a Dominican friar named Richard Fishacre at Oxford argued that planets and stars are made of the same elements as Earth. He used light and colour to show that their colours – red Mars, yellow Venus, blue Moon – prove they’re not made of a special invisible element. Though critics slammed him, modern science now finds similar facts with telescopes, discovering atmospheres rich in water and sulfur dioxide on distant worlds."
