title: "EU May Force Companies to Buy Less From China"
summary: "The EU is planning a €3 billion ReSourceEU plan to cut its dependence on China for raw materials. It will give money to 25‑30 projects that find alternative suppliers and could add rules that stop certain Chinese‑made metals from leaving the EU. If companies ignore the plan, Brussels could pass laws forcing them to diversify. The move comes after China used chip and rare‑earth restrictions to pressure European industry."
