title: "MPs’ Immigration Talk Has Become Much More Hostile in Recent Years"
summary: "Researchers used a custom machine‑learning model to scan a century of House of Commons speeches and found that in the last five years Labour and Conservative MPs have increasingly used harsh language about migrants. The study shows the shift started around 2018 and has been driven partly by Reform UK’s influence, turning an once relatively welcoming tone into one that frames migrants as criminals."
