title: "Woman who escaped rape and torture in Congo wins UK citizenship after government reversal"
summary: "A 48‑year‑old woman who fled the Democratic Republic of the Congo after being raped and tortured gets UK citizenship after the Home Office reversed a decision that would normally deny such applicants. She entered the UK illegally 18 years ago, but the court said her past should not count because she was a refugee and had good character. The win is a first under a new rule that could affect around 71,000 refugees."
