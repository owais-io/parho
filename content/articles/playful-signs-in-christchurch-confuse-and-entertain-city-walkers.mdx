summary: "In Christchurch, artist Cameron Hunt put up six fake city‑council signs around the city centre. Some read things like “slightly haunted but manageable” or “keep to 2.83 km/h”. The signs look official but carry silly messages, sparking confusion and laughter among pedestrians. The city council cheered the project and social‑media users shared photos and jokes. Hunt says the prank encourages people to notice and talk about their surroundings."
