summary: "Researchers at Aberystwyth University are gathering the few surviving words of an ancient Celtic language spoken across Britain and Ireland 2,000 years ago to create the first full dictionary. The words come from sources like Julius Caesar’s notes, Roman military letters, place‑names and Ogham stone carvings. They expect to compile more than 1,000 entries. The dictionary will help linguists, historians, archaeologists, and even people interested in modern Celtic tongues, and will be published online and in print."
