title: "Gold Price Surge Boosts UK South Asian Jewellers"
summary: "Gold prices jumped to more than $5,000 an ounce last year, and that spike has made gold shops on London’s Golden Mile very busy. South‑Asian owners say people are buying jewellery and selling old pieces as a safe investment when banks close branches and markets feel shaky. The high price keeps wedding demand strong, and even younger customers are buying bars to save money. While prices fell after Trump’s move to the Fed, the boom still helped many shops."
