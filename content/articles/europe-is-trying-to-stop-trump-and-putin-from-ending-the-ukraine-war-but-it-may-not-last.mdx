title: "Europe is trying to stop Trump and Putin from ending the Ukraine war, but it may not last"
summary: "Last week’s talks between Russia and a Trump envoy failed again, showing a pattern of dead‑ends in Ukraine. Trump has been trying to make a deal that would let Russia win without fighting, but Europe and NATO keep pushing back by sending weapons and support to Ukraine. Russia says Europe is the weak spot in Trump’s plan. The European push can hold for now, but it may not last if the US backs off or the war gets worse."
