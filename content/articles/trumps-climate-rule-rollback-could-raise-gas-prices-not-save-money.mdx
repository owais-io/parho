title: "Trump’s Climate Rule Rollback Could Raise Gas Prices, Not Save Money"
summary: "The Trump administration says ditching vehicle climate rules will save $1.3 trillion, but an EPA analysis shows it would actually raise gasoline prices and cost $1.5 trillion by 2055. The rollback would lift emissions 10% and add $4.7 trillion in climate harm. Experts say the savings are small, while the costs—higher fuel, maintenance, and climate damage—outweigh them. The rule mainly benefits oil industry donors, not ordinary drivers."
