title: "Met police racism claims double in one year"
summary: "Racism claims against Met police officers jumped 108% last year, the most in five years, according to FOI data. The surge is tied to accusations that the force’s disciplinary system, led by the Director of Professional Standards, targets Black officers more than white ones. A 2024 review found anti‑Black racism built into the Met’s culture, while the department says it is still working on reforms and culture change."
