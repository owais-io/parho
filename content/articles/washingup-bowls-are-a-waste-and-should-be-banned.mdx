title: "Washing‑up bowls are a waste and should be banned"
summary: "Jason Hazeley argues that washing‑up bowls are an unnecessary, messy accessory that should be banned. He compares them to the old TV cabinets that people used to hide TVs in. The bowls hold water but never drain, get dirty, and are made of plastic that can get moldy. The writer says they offer no real water‑saving benefits and simply add clutter and waste. He calls for ditching them in favor of a simple sink."
