title: "Christmas Trees Turn Into Sea‑Defense Dunes on Lancashire Coast"
summary: "Volunteers in Lancashire are burying thousands of used Christmas trees along the south‑Blackpool coast to create new sand dunes. The buried trees grow into dunes that shield homes from rising sea levels and storm surges. The project also helps wildlife; sand lizards, long missing from the area, are now thriving on the dunes. As the sea rises, the dunes may need to be built higher rather than further out to stay effective."
