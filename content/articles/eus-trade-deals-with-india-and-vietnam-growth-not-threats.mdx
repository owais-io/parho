title: "EU’s Trade Deals with India and Vietnam: Growth, Not Threats"
summary: "The EU has struck a huge trade deal with India and is upgrading ties with Vietnam. While the tariff cuts are modest, the focus is on letting Vietnam move into high‑tech manufacturing and giving India more export space. Unlike Trump’s America, which used tariffs as a weapon, Brussels wants trade to boost growth while keeping both sides free to choose partners. The moves give India and Vietnam room to grow without demanding political loyalty."
