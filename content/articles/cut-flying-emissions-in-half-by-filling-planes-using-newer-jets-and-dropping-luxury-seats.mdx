title: "Cut flying emissions in half by filling planes, using newer jets and dropping luxury seats"
summary: "A study says flying emissions could drop by half if planes are fuller, use newer models, and have fewer luxury seats. It examined 27 million flights and found U.S. and Australian airports pollute most. The EU wants airlines to use green fuel, but it’s limited and costly. Instead, airlines could fill planes to 95 %, switch to modern jets, and avoid premium cabins. These changes could cut emissions 50‑75 % and need less green fuel. Airports could charge more for dirty planes."
