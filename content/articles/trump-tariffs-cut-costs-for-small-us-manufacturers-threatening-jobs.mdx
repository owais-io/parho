title: "Trump Tariffs Cut Costs for Small U.S. Manufacturers, Threatening Jobs"
summary: "Trump tariffs have pushed up costs for small U.S. factories, like EarthQuaker Devices, a guitar‑pedal maker that supplies big bands. The 30% tariff hike means the company now bears extra expenses it can’t afford, threatening jobs. Across northeast Ohio, one‑in‑three manufacturers report losses, and many are cutting staff or halting projects. While some use trade‑zone loopholes, the overall effect is slowing reshoring and hurting local economies."
