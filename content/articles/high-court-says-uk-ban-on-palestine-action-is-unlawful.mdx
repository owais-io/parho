title: "High Court Says UK Ban on Palestine Action Is Unlawful"
summary: "UK courts ruled that banning the protest group Palestine Action was unlawful and too broad. Judges said the ban violated the right to protest and that normal criminal law could handle property damage instead of terrorism law. The ban made it a crime to belong to or even support the group, causing thousands of arrests. The government will appeal, but the decision limits the use of proscription."
