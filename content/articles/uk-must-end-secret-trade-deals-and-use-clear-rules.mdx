title: "UK Must End Secret Trade Deals and Use Clear Rules"
summary: "The UK is still making trade deals behind closed doors, sometimes with people who don’t fit the job and with countries like China that raise security worries. MPs argue the government should set rules, keep deals transparent, and double‑check that big companies aren’t secretly spying or bribing officials. Past examples, such as the shady al‑Yamamah defence deal, show why oversight matters. The call is for a public, systematic process that keeps the UK’s interests and values in front."
