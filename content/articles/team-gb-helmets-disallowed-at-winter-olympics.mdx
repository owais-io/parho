title: "Team GB Helmets Disallowed at Winter Olympics"
summary: "Team GB's skeleton racers cannot use their new aerodynamic helmets at the Winter Olympics because the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation says the designs are illegal—they stick out at the back. Matt Weston and Marcus Wyatt had won all seven World Cup races with older helmets and hoped the new helmets would make them faster. The British association appealed, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport sided with the federation. The team remains hopeful."
