title: "Students Protest New Student Loan Rules, Call Chancellor a “Loan Shark”"
summary: "Students in England and Wales staged a protest outside Parliament, calling Chancellor Rachel Reeves a “loan shark” over new rules that will freeze the repayment threshold at £29,385 for three years. The change means many recent graduates will have to pay more as their interest‑bearing debt grows. The National Union of Students wants the freeze lifted and interest rates lowered, arguing the system puts graduates in financial danger."
