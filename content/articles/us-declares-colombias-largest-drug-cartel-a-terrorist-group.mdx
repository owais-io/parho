title: "U.S. Declares Colombia’s Largest Drug Cartel a Terrorist Group"
summary: "The U.S. has named the Gulf Clan, Colombia’s biggest criminal group that traffics cocaine, a foreign terrorist organization. The move could worsen ties between President Donald Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who opposes U.S. pressure on Venezuela and recent U.S. strikes on drug‑smuggling boats. The Gulf Clan controls many smuggling routes, especially the Darién Gap, and has fought other rebels for control of the border. The designation adds to U.S. actions against other Latin‑American cartels."
