title: "Kashmir glacier melts, changing water, wildlife and people"
summary: "Scientists say the Kolahoi glacier near Pahalgam is shrinking fast. Its meltwater feeds farms and forests, but as the ice retreats, rivers dry up, crops fail and animals lose food. Deer, ibex and snow leopards are forced closer to villages. Rising heat, pollution and cutting trees speed the melt. By the end of the century, many glaciers could vanish, changing water, wildlife and life for people in Kashmir."
