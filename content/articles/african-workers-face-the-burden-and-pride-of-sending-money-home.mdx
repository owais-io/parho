title: "African Workers Face the Burden and Pride of Sending Money Home"
summary: "Across Africa, many workers send part of their wages back home, a practice called the “black tax.” In Nigeria, the average worker gives about 20% of their pay to relatives, while in South Africa a single salary may support nearly four people. The money helps families pay rent, school fees and medical bills, but it also keeps workers from saving and growing businesses. Remittance taxes add extra pressure for migrants who still need to help their families."
