title: "Most Homeowners Won’t Pay More Even if RBA Raises Rates"
summary: "A majority of Australia’s 3.3 million mortgage holders will not see their payments rise if the Reserve Bank raises rates, because most banks only change repayments when borrowers ask. The RBA is expected to lift the cash rate to 3.85 %. Those who have been paying the minimum may see a bump, while most borrowers will stay the same unless they intervene. The article urges people who worry about rising costs to seek financial help."
