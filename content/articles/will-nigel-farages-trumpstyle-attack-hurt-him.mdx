title: "Will Nigel Farage’s Trump‑style attack hurt him?"
summary: "Nigel Farage has denied bullying allegations and blamed the BBC for double‑sided treatment. His angry, Trump‑style rant was laughed at by liberals but celebrated by right‑wing outlets like the Daily Mail and GB News. Farage claims everyone is equally guilty, avoids apologising, and wants to fuel cynicism instead of seeking forgiveness. The article argues that this strategy may not win over voters and could backfire."
