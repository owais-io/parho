title: "What Happens When the £100 Contactless Card Limit Is Removed"
summary: "In March 2026 the £100 limit on contactless card payments will be removed. Banks can set new limits for single and total use. The change lets banks adjust to price shifts and tech. Fraud risk could rise, but rates are low and banks will add checks. If a card is lost, report it quickly to avoid a £35 bill. You can still set personal limits or turn off contactless."
