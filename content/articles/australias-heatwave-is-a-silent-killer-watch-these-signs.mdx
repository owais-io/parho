title: "Australia’s Heatwave Is a Silent Killer – Watch These Signs"
summary: "Australia’s southern states are hitting 40 °C, and the heat you feel can be up to 10 °C hotter. Heatwaves are a “silent killer” because they cause many hospitalisations and deaths. Symptoms start with heat stress—weakness, dizziness—then can worsen to heat exhaustion (nausea, fainting) and dangerous heatstroke (high fever, confusion). Stay cool by drinking plenty of water, staying indoors during peak sun, and helping older or ill people stay hydrated. Avoid heavy activity and use fans or cool showers to stay safe."
