title: "EU Demands Compensation Clause for Brexit Reset Talks"
summary: "The EU wants a clause that would force the UK to pay if it backs out of a new post‑Brexit trade deal. Nicknamed the “Farage clause,” it is meant to protect the EU from losing money on border checks that were set up when the UK left the EU. The clause is routine in deals, but the UK says it also works the other way round."
