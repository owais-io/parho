title: "End of Obamacare subsidies could hurt US healthcare"
summary: "When the government stops giving money‑help for Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance, many people will either pick cheaper plans with big out‑of‑pocket costs or go without coverage. Experts warn this could create a vicious cycle where only sicker people stay in insurance pools, raising premiums for everyone. Hospitals, especially small ones in rural areas, may struggle to cover costs and could close or raise prices."
