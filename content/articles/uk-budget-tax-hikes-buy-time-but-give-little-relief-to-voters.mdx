title: "UK budget: Tax hikes buy time but give little relief to voters"
summary: "UK budget sees tax hikes to keep government afloat, but offers little relief to voters. Chancellor Rachel Reeves used the £26bn package to placate bond markets and backbenchers, lifting the 40% tax band for many and scrapping the two‑child benefit cap. Most new spending will fill budget gaps, not improve services, leaving NHS wait‑times high and household pay growth flat. It’s a temporary lifeline, not a long‑term fix."
