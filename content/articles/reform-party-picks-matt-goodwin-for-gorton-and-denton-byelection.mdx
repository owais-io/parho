title: "Reform Party Picks Matt Goodwin for Gorton and Denton Byelection"
summary: "Reform Party has chosen Matt Goodwin to run in the Gorton and Denton byelection. Goodwin is a former lecturer who has made far‑right comments and spread conspiracy theories. He knows very little about the local area and has no ties to the community. The choice has sparked criticism from the press and locals, who worry his views and lack of experience could hurt the seat. Reform hopes the new candidate will swing the vote in its favour."
