title: "Labour’s Budget Chaos Signals Self‑Sabotage"
summary: "Labour’s budget speech caused confusion and back‑and‑forth statements that many saw as the party hurting itself. The party kept changing its plans, leaked information, and tried to defend a new two‑child benefit cap that was never in its manifesto. Critics said it was messing with the economy, while Labour blamed the Conservatives. In short, the party’s chaotic approach looks like deliberate self‑sabotage."

Labour’s budget speech caused confusion and back‑and‑forth statements that many saw as the party hurting itself. The party kept changing its plans, leaked information, and tried to defend a new two‑child benefit cap that was never in its manifesto. Critics said it was messing with the economy, while Labour blamed the Conservatives. In short, the party’s chaotic approach looks like deliberate self‑sabotage.
