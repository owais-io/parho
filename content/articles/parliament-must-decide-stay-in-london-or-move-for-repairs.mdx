title: "Parliament Must Decide: Stay in London or Move for Repairs"
summary: "Westminster Palace is in serious trouble with leaks, fire risks, and heating failures. MPs face a choice: keep working in the damaged building while it is rebuilt or relocate to a temporary site for up to 20 years. The cheaper option costs £16 bn and could save money long‑term. Moving could also spread jobs and power outside London, making the debate about more than just money."
