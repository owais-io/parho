title: "Keto diet not proven to cure schizophrenia, experts say"
summary: "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed a Harvard doctor cured schizophrenia with a keto diet, but experts say there’s no evidence. Harvard psychiatrist Christopher Palmer said the diet may help some people, but only two case studies exist and they don’t prove a cure. Researchers are running trials, and the keto diet could reduce side‑effects of psychiatric drugs. However, it’s hard to follow long‑term and can be expensive, so it’s not a quick fix."
