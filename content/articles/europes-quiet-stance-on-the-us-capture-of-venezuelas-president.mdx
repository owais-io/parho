title: "Europe’s Quiet Stance on the US Capture of Venezuela’s President"
summary: "Europe has stayed silent after US forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, even though many say the move broke international law. Leaders praised the end of his rule but avoided calling the action illegal, because they need Trump’s support for Ukraine. The UK is especially cautious, not wanting to upset Washington, which it sees as key to its security. Critics warn that this lack of condemnation could embolden other powers."
