title: "How to Replace Capitalism to Protect the Planet"
summary: "Capitalism treats the planet like a profit‑making machine, pushing us to build SUVs and luxury homes while ignoring housing, public transport, and clean energy. It forces governments to keep fossil fuels cheap, and many investors now abandon climate pledges. The authors say we must switch to a democratic economy. They outline three steps: a new public‑finance system, community decision‑making on priorities, and employee‑owned companies. Only then can we build a climate‑friendly, fair society."
