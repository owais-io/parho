title: "Kemi Badenoch’s confusing budget speech leaves her own MPs embarrassed"
summary: "Kemi Badenoch, the UK Conservative opposition leader, made a confusing and chaotic speech at the budget question time. She talked about fake conspiracies, accused colleagues of cheating, and mixed up budget details. Her comments left her own MPs looking embarrassed and the audience unsure. The session highlighted how the opposition’s attack on the government was more about drama than facts. Even the speaker had to intervene, and the Treasury’s chief had to answer questions."
