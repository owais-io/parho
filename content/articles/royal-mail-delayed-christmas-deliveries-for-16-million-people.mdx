title: "Royal Mail delayed Christmas deliveries for 16 million people"
summary: "Royal Mail let 16 million Brits miss their Christmas mail. Citizens Advice said it was the worst Christmas‑time delay in five years and that 5.7 million people didn’t get important notices like health appointments or fines. Royal Mail says most items were on time but still fails official targets and was fined £21 m. Higher stamp prices mean fewer cards are sent, and regulators warn the service could worsen."
