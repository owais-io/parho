title: "30 % of UK GPs now use AI tools like ChatGPT during patient visits"
summary: "A new study shows about 30 % of UK GPs use AI tools such as ChatGPT during patient visits. Doctors use it to write summaries, help with diagnoses, and handle paperwork. However, many are worried about mistakes, legal trouble, and privacy. The tools are mostly unregulated, and usage is higher among male doctors and in wealthier areas. The extra time doctors gain is usually spent resting, not seeing more patients."
