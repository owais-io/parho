title: "Flooding is making homes unsellable in Britain"
summary: "In Nottingham, three women’s homes keep flooding, even after the government put up barriers and pumps. The damage is big, and the houses are now hard to sell because buyers know they’ve been flooded. New building projects add more water runoff, raising flood risk for existing houses. Prices for flood‑prone homes fall 8‑32 %. Lenders are wary, and a government flood‑insurance scheme ends in 2039, leaving future risks unclear."
