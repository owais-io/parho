title: "WHO Plans to Test and Integrate Traditional Medicine into Modern Healthcare"
summary: "The WHO is launching a new decade‑long plan to study traditional remedies—like herbal teas, Ayurveda, and acupuncture—to see if they really work. It will use science tools such as AI, genetics, and brain scans to build solid evidence, regulate practices, and link them with regular medicine. Thailand is already adding tested herbal treatments to its health list. The goal is safer, cheaper care that respects cultural healing methods."
