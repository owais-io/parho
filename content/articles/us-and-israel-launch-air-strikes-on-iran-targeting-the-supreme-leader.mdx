title: "U.S. and Israel Launch Air Strikes on Iran, Targeting the Supreme Leader"
summary: "U.S. and Israeli forces launched a large air campaign against Iran, striking more than 200 sites in the morning, including a target near the Supreme Leader’s compound in Tehran. The aim was to weaken Iran’s military and leadership. Iran responded with missiles and drones that hit U.S. bases in the region and damaged a hotel in Dubai. Casualties were limited but the attacks show the conflict is one‑sided, with the U.S. able to fly many more missions."
