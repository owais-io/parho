title: "Trump’s legacy is a blip, not a historic moment"
summary: "Simon Tisdall argues that what many people see as historic changes—like the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Arab Spring, 9/11, or Trump’s presidency—are often overblown. He says the Cold War never really ended, and Russia is still a threat. Trump’s influence is seen as a brief blip that will fade, while democracy and international law stay strong. The article reminds us that real turning points are rare, and we should focus on steady progress."
