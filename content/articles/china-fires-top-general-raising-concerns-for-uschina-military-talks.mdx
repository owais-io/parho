title: "China Fires Top General, Raising Concerns for US‑China Military Talks"
summary: "China’s leader Xi Jinping has fired top general Zhang Youxia from the People’s Liberation Army, showing he is tightening control over the military. The move shrinks the top military board to just himself and a few aides. It makes it harder for the U.S. and China to discuss defense matters directly, raising the risk of accidental clashes. Experts say this purge also signals how little room for disagreement remains under Xi’s rule."
