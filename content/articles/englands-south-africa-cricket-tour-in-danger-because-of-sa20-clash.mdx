title: "England’s South Africa Cricket Tour in Danger Because of SA20 Clash"
summary: "England’s planned three-Test, three-ODI and three-T20 tour of South Africa could be cut short. The limited‑overs games are set to run right after the SA20 franchise league, which uses the same venues and players. England and Cricket South Africa can’t split the tour, and the England board won’t move games to February because of an overseas Test series. Cricket South Africa is asking SA20 owners to delay the league, but the future of the ODIs is still uncertain."
