title: "Tennessee Tests Trump Adviser’s Plan to Expand State Immigration Enforcement"
summary: "Washington adviser Stephen Miller is pushing a new way for states to help federal immigration agents. Tennessee has started a set of bills that would make police, judges, teachers and others part of the system, forcing them to report undocumented people to ICE. The laws would also keep records secret, cut school enrollment for illegal residents, and give the state power to withhold money from cities that don’t cooperate. Critics say the plan oversteps federal authority and violates rights."
