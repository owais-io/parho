title: "London’s Hidden Wildlife: From Scorpions to Peacocks"
summary: "London is full of surprising animals – scorpions, snakes, turtles, seals, peacocks, falcons – all living right in the city. Warmer city winters, gardens, canals, and the Thames give them homes. Things like a special London mosquito, yellow‑tailed scorpions, and even harbor seals have found places to thrive. The river’s cleanup has brought otters and seals back, and city wildlife now roams rooftops, parks, and alleys."
