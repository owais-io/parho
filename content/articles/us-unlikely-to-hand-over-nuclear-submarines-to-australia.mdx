title: "US unlikely to hand over nuclear submarines to Australia"
summary: "Australia says the Aukus pact, which promises it three US Virginia‑class nuclear submarines, is moving on schedule. But critics and a U.S. congressional report say the U.S. may keep the subs for its own use, especially if a China‑Taiwan crisis erupts. The report suggests the subs could stay under U.S. command, not Australian, undermining the deal’s promise. The Australian defense minister insists the project is still on track."
