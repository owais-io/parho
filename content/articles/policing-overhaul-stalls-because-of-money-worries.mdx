title: "Policing overhaul stalls because of money worries"
summary: "Labour wants to cut police forces from 43 to about 12‑15 and set up a national operations centre, plus a counter‑terrorism hub that would be Britain’s version of the FBI. The plan should save money and speed up decisions, but the government can’t find enough funding. The white paper that explains the changes is now due in January instead of Christmas, and some mergers are only being discussed, not forced."
