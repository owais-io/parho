title: "Queensland lifts ban on developer donations, sparking corruption fears"
summary: "Queensland’s government will let property developers give money to politicians and lift donation limits. The move, backed by the ruling party, is criticised by the Greens, who say it opens the door to more corruption. The new law quadruples the money a party or candidate can receive each four‑year term, raising the cap to $48,000. Critics argue it will mainly help developers and the LNP, while keeping the current system unfair for others."
