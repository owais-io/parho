title: "Toowoomba Pasta Goes Viral in South Korea"
summary: "Rebecca Shaw, a columnist from the Australian regional city of Toowoomba, talks about how her hometown—known for gardens and rugby, not seafood—has become famous overseas for a dish called Toowoomba pasta. The creamy seafood pasta, oddly named after the inland city, has taken South Korea by storm, selling in restaurants and convenience stores. Shaw, who grew up there, finds the coincidence amusing and proud, even joking it could outshine the town itself."
