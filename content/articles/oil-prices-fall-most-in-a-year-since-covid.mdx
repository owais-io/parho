title: "Oil Prices Fall Most in a Year Since COVID"
summary: "Oil prices slid almost 20% last year, the biggest yearly drop since 2020. The market has too much crude, so prices keep falling even with war in some oil‑producing areas. OPEC will wait before cutting output, and analysts think prices could drop to $50‑$55 a barrel by 2026. Lower fuel prices could help families, but gas and electricity bills stay high."

OPEC will wait before cutting output, and analysts think prices could drop to $50‑$55 a barrel by 2026. Lower fuel prices could help families, but gas and electricity bills stay high.
