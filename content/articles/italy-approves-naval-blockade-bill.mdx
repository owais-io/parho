title: "Italy Approves Naval Blockade Bill"
summary: "Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has signed a bill that lets the government stop boats from reaching Italian shores for up to 30 days, and up to six months if needed, when there is a serious threat or a surge in arrivals. The law also gives fines and can confiscate vessels that break the rules, aiming especially at rescue ships. The move follows a sharp rise in deaths over the Mediterranean and tightens Italy’s already hard‑line stance on irregular migration."
