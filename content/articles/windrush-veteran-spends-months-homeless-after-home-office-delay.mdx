summary: "George Campbell, a 69‑year‑old who arrived from Jamaica as a child, was left homeless for months because the Home Office took too long to confirm his legal status in the UK. Without proof of residency, he was denied housing help and a pension, and had to sleep in a bus shelter and rely on food banks. After a long fight, he finally received his immigration status and is now in a night shelter with charity support."
