title: "Are Rising ADHD Diagnoses Really Overdiagnosis?"
summary: "A letter argues that the rise in ADHD diagnoses may be due to shifting boundaries, not a real increase in illness. The author suggests people fall on a spectrum of attention and focus, so many may be labelled “ADHD” by a lower threshold. It calls for more nuanced, preventive approaches, such as play, nature and arts, instead of just medical labels."

A letter argues that the rise in ADHD diagnoses may be due to shifting boundaries, not a real increase in illness.

It calls for more nuanced, preventive approaches, such as play, nature and arts, instead of just medical labels.
