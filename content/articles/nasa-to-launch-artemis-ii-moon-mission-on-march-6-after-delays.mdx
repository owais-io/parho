title: "NASA to launch Artemis II moon mission on March 6 after delays"
summary: "NASA is set to launch the Artemis II mission on March 6 after a successful fueling test that helped clear earlier setbacks, like a hydrogen leak. Four astronauts—three Americans and one Canadian—will travel around the Moon for ten days but won’t land. The launch also comes after a tough review of Boeing’s Starliner capsule, which caused long ISS stays for two astronauts. The mission tests systems for future moon landings and will travel farther than any crewed flight since 1970."
