title: "UK warns EU’s ‘Made in Europe’ plan could hurt trade and raise costs"
summary: "UK minister Nick Thomas‑Symonds said the EU’s new “Made in Europe” rule could raise costs and block trade between Britain and the bloc. The plan would favour European‑made goods in public contracts, but critics fear it would hurt shared supply chains and damage UK‑Spain trade. The UK wants to keep open markets while the EU pushes for more local production in key sectors."
