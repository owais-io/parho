title: "Australia plans to tax polluters and give households cash back"
summary: "Australia plans a new tax on fossil‑fuel companies that would raise about $35 billion a year. The money would go to households through a universal energy‑cost relief payment, front‑loaded over the next decade. The levy would apply to the carbon content of imported and locally extracted oil, gas and coal, aiming to make Australian consumers pay the real cost of pollution while boosting the budget. It is a “polluter‑pays” scheme the report says should be fair and popular."
