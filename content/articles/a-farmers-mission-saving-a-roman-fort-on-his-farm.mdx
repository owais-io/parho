title: "A Farmer’s Mission: Saving a Roman Fort on His Farm"
summary: "On a cold day, a farmer named Andrea Meanwell is out taking pictures of his riverbank, but the real story is his effort to protect a 12‑hectare Roman fort and settlement on his land. The River Lune is eroding the bank, threatening the ancient remains. He’s been asking for money to reinforce the bank, and Historic England is ready to help if he supplies photos. He also wonders about the fort’s name, probably “Alone”, linking it to the river."
