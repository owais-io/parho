title: "Labour Keeps Old Voting System, Even If It Lets a Disliked Party Win"
summary: "Labour is pushing to keep the UK’s current voting system, even though most people want a fairer method. The old system lets big parties use the fear of a split vote to keep smaller ones out. If the Reform party wins a seat, Labour could stay in power, but under a fair system the Reform party would not win. Labour’s refusal to change the system could let a disliked party take control."
