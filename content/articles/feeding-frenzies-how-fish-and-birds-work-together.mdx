title: "Feeding Frenzies: How Fish and Birds Work Together"
summary: "The article shows a dramatic sea scene where small fish, like sprats and young herring, swim close together in a tight ball to hide from predators. This “bait ball” attracts both birds and larger fish. The birds dive in while the fish swim in a tight circle, then all rush to the surface when the fish get caught. It illustrates how living in a group can give protection and also attract more danger."
