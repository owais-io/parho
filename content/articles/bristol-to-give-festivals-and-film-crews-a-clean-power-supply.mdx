title: "Bristol to give festivals and film crews a clean power supply"
summary: "Bristol will give festivals and film crews a clean, battery‑powered supply of electricity, instead of diesel generators, starting next summer. City council and the West of England mayor have signed a deal to deliver 100% renewable power from two sites, stored in batteries that can be moved to any event. More than 20 festivals and film crews are expected to use it, improving air quality and cutting emissions. It’s the world’s first big‑scale, government‑backed clean‑power hub."
