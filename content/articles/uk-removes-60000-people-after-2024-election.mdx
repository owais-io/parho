title: "UK Removes 60,000 People After 2024 Election"
summary: "Since Labour won the 2024 election, the UK Home Office says it has deported or removed almost 60,000 unauthorized migrants and convicted criminals. The figures include 15,200 forced removals and 43,000 voluntary departures after being told they were illegal. The government plans to increase deportations, stop asylum‑hotel use, and limit appeal routes. Critics say the moves unfairly link migration with crime and threaten human‑rights protections."
