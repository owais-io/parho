title: "Four Shark Bites in 48 Hours Leave Sydney Surfers Scared of Their Own Beaches"
summary: "In just two days, four sharks bit people on Sydney's east coast, sending the local surf community into panic. The attacks hit Vaucluse, Dee Why, Manly and a nearby beach, leading to beach closures, event cancellations and a big‑wave surfer quitting his city training. Surf Life Saving NSW stepped up patrols and urged people to stay away, with swimmers told to use pools instead. Once‑busy beaches have become empty, worried spaces."
