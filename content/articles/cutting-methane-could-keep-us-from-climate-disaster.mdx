title: "Cutting methane could keep us from climate disaster"
summary: "Global warming has already exceeded the 1.5 °C target set by the Paris Agreement. The risk is that more heat could trigger runaway events, like the Amazon drying out or Greenland melting. Scientists say the fastest way to slow next‑decade warming is to cut methane, the gas 80 times stronger than CO₂ but lasting only about 20 years. Cutting methane by 40‑50 % could hold temperatures back 0.3‑0.5 °C by 2050, giving the world time to shift to clean energy."
