title: "Louisiana Court Lets Ten Commandments Posters in Public Schools"
summary: "A federal appeals court in Louisiana lifted a stop on a state law that forces every public school classroom to hang a poster of the Ten Commandments. The 12‑to‑6 decision said there wasn’t enough evidence yet to decide if the law violates the Constitution, so it can now be enforced. Parents and civil‑rights groups say the rule forces government‑backed religion in schools, while state officials argue the texts are historic and non‑religious."
