title: "Nuclear treaties are not stopping new weapons"
summary: "Nuclear weapons are still expanding. China is adding more bombs while other countries modernise arsenals. Treaties meant to stop proliferation are not working. Few people or politicians talk about it, even though false alarms have nearly caused war. The NPT review in April is a chance to change the trend, but many say a nuclear‑free world is unlikely soon. Actions can still make the world safer."
