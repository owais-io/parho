title: "England Reaches Record Rough Sleepers in 2025"
summary: "Record number of people slept rough on England’s streets last year, with 4,793 recorded on a single night in autumn 2025 – a 3% rise from 2024 and the highest count since 2017. Children in temporary homes rose to 175,990, while older renters face eviction risks. Charities say true figures could be up to 15,000. The government has pledged £50m to help and introduced a Renters’ Rights Act to stop “no‑fault” evictions. Action is still urgently needed."
