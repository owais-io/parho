title: "Foreign investors buying and renting out Toledo homes, hurting local families"
summary: "Foreign investors, especially from Israel and other countries, have bought many single‑family houses in Toledo, Ohio. They rent them out at high rates and often leave the properties in poor condition, which hurts local families who want to buy or rent affordably. The landlords are usually out of town and ignore repair requests, leading to eviction spikes. Although the money they bring can help the city’s tax budget, it makes it harder for working‑class residents to become homeowners."
