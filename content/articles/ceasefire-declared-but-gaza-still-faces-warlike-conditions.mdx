title: "Ceasefire Declared, but Gaza Still Faces War‑Like Conditions"
summary: "Since Israel said it would stop fighting, Palestinians are still being hit. In October, a drone shot down two young boys in a tent. Israel has killed more than 360 people in Gaza, about seven a day, which many say still counts as war. The new “yellow line” splits Gaza, giving Israel most land. Aid trucks are arriving, but houses, schools and hospitals are ruined and many still live in tents. The situation feels like no peace."
