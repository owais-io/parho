title: "Home Secretary Wins Right to Challenge Palestine Action Ban"
summary: "A high court said banning the Palestine Action group was too harsh and let the Home Secretary appeal. The ban will stay in place while the appeal happens, so people who have been arrested for supporting the group—over 2,500 in total—remain in limbo. Police will stop arresting people for showing support but will keep evidence for future cases. The court also said the ban breaches free‑speech rights."
