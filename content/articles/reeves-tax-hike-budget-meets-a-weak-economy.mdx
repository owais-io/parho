title: "Reeves' tax hike budget meets a weak economy"
summary: "Labour chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a budget that raises taxes by about £26 billion and promises more money for the NHS, better utility bills, and higher benefits for families. She wants richer people and big‑value landlords to pay more, while cutting the two‑child limit on benefits. But the economy is barely growing and inflation is still high, so the move has made bond markets a little calmer but left many businesses worried about hiring costs."
