title: "UK shoppers wary of spending in 2026, says survey"
summary: "UK shoppers remain cautious about spending in 2026, a KPMG survey of 3,000 people found. Even though 56% feel safe with their money, 58% are worried the economy is getting worse. Many are holding back on eating out, buying cars or furniture, and older people are especially cautious. Inflation is falling but still high, and a late budget has added uncertainty. The government hopes a lower interest rate will lift confidence."
