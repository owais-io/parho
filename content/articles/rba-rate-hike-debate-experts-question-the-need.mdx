title: "RBA Rate Hike Debate: Experts Question the Need"
summary: "Australia’s Reserve Bank is expected to raise rates to 3.85% this week, but a small group of economists says it’s probably better to keep the cash rate at 3.6%. They warn that a hike could hurt the recent rebound in jobs and private‑sector growth, that inflation appears to be easing, and that the labour market isn’t yet overheating. With global uncertainty high, many think the RBA should hold its breath for now."
