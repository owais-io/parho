title: "More Mortgage Options for Freelancers and Gig Workers"
summary: "The FCA is planning new rules that let people with variable or irregular incomes—like freelancers, contractors, and gig workers—pay their mortgages more flexibly. Instead of a fixed monthly amount, borrowers could vary payments or pay larger sums every few months. The regulator also wants to consider rent history, clean credit records, and interest‑only loans, and to make mortgages available to older people. These changes aim to help more UK residents buy homes."
