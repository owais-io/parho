title: "Trump says Netflix’s $83bn purchase of Warner Bros could hurt competition"
summary: "Donald Trump said he will help decide if Netflix can buy Warner Bros for $83 billion. He warned the deal could hurt competition because Netflix already has a big share of the streaming market. Netflix won the auction and would add Warner’s studios and HBO Max to its lineup. Trump’s involvement is unusual and many in Hollywood think the merger should be stopped. The deal isn’t expected to finish until 2026."
