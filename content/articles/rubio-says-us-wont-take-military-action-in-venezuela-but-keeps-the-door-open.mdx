summary: "Senator Marco Rubio told a Senate hearing that the Trump administration isn’t planning a war in Venezuela, but it could use force if other methods fail. He defended the removal of Nicolás Maduro, the seizure of Venezuelan oil, and the lack of U.S. troops on the ground, saying the moves are for law‑enforcement, not war. Democrats warned the approach could backfire, and boat‑strike lawsuits are already in court."
