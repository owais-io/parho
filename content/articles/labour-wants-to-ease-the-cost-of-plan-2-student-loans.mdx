title: "Labour Wants to Ease the Cost of Plan 2 Student Loans"
summary: "Labour ministers are looking into ways to cut the cost of Plan 2 student loans. The Treasury and Education Dept are testing options to lower repayment rates, which rise with RPI inflation plus 3%. The current £29,385 threshold is frozen until 2030, meaning many grads may pay up to £300 more each year. Labour wants to freeze the threshold, while Conservatives say it’s a “debt trap.” No decision is expected until the spring statement."
