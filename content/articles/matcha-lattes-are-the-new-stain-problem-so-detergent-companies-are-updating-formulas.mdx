summary: "Unilever says matcha drinks are Britain’s biggest new stain, especially for Gen Z. A survey of 2,000 UK adults found 70 % of Gen Z dirty their clothes every week, with 39 % reporting tough green marks from matcha. The company has tweaked its Persil and Surf detergents to fight these bright stains, just as it did last year for gym‑gear odors. The “stains index” will be refreshed each year to keep up with new trends."
