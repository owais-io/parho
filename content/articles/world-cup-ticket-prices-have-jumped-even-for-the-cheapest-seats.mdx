title: "World Cup ticket prices have jumped, even for the cheapest seats"
summary: "For the 2026 World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico, the lowest‑priced tickets are now up to three times more expensive than they were at past tournaments. FIFA’s new dynamic pricing lets seats change cost based on demand, so many “cheap seats” are scarce and pricey. Most games have higher prices than earlier rounds, especially the finals and host‑country matches. Fans who wait last minute risk missing out or paying more."
