title: "Victims of sexual offences get uneven police help, says Home Secretary"
summary: "Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said that how police treat sexual‑offence victims depends on where they live – a “postcode lottery”. She explained that many current police squads are still trainee‑led and that the government will set up specialist teams in every force to give victims a consistent, better chance of getting a full investigation and, if needed, charges. This move aims to standardise police support across the country."
