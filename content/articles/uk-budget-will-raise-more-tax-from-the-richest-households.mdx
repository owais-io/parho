title: "UK budget will raise more tax from the richest households"
summary: "Labour’s new budget pushes up the tax bill for Britain’s wealthiest families. It adds a surcharge on homes worth over £2 million, raises the dividend tax by 2p, and keeps income‑tax thresholds frozen for three years, which will bring many workers into higher tax brackets. The plan aims to raise about £26 bn, give £3 bn a year to remove the two‑child benefit limit, and cut energy bills by around £150 a year on average. Financial markets welcomed the extra fiscal space, but some MPs warned the cuts will still hurt working people."
