title: "Milan’s New Ice Arena Is Roughly Ready for Games"
summary: "Construction on Milan’s new Santagiulia ice rink has finished enough to host a game, but the arena still looks unfinished. Dust‑covered ice, leaking pipes, and half‑built seats left fans and officials scrambling. Still, a 12,000‑strong crowd watched Italy beat France 4‑1 in the women’s opener, proving the rink could work. The venue’s messy state is part of a wider plan to redevelop the area with homes, a park and a mall."
