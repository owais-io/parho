title: "Airplane cabins expose passengers to dangerous levels of tiny particles"
summary: "French scientists measured invisible ultrafine particles on a plane from Paris to Europe. They found the air was clean while cruising, but when the plane was on the ground, boarding, or taxiing, the particle levels were more than twice what the WHO calls high. Soot particles showed the same pattern. The study also shows that these particles spread far from airports, putting nearby residents at risk. With air traffic growing, regulators need to act."
