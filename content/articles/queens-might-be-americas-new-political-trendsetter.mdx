title: "Queens Might Be America’s New Political Trendsetter"
summary: "Queens might become America’s new political barometer. The New York borough, home to 2.3 million people of 140 languages, swung hard for Trump in 2024 after years of solid Democratic support. Latino, Asian and other communities are voting for the right‑wing candidate, while the district of Alexandria Ocasio‑Cortez still dominates. Local races like state‑assemblyman Zohran Mamdani show growing anti‑establishment energy. The shift means national reporters may look east, not mid‑west, to spot the next election trend."
