summary: "Swiss prosecutors have brought money‑laundering charges against Credit Suisse and its new owner UBS for a 2013‑2016 loan deal that hurt Mozambique’s economy. The banks helped arrange $2 bn of loans that were largely siphoned off, with kickbacks to Credit Suisse staff. The scandal led the IMF to halt aid and caused a crash in Mozambique. UBS took over Credit Suisse in 2023 and is fighting the accusations after earlier settlements with US and UK regulators."
