title: "Celebrities Warn UK Against Weakening Torture Laws"
summary: "Starmer faces a letter from 21 well‑known figures, including Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley and Michael Palin, warning that plans to soften the UK’s human‑rights law would let the country back down on torture. The signers urge the prime minister to keep Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights— which bans torture and inhuman treatment—intact. They say weakening the rule could embolden other governments to abandon similar safeguards."
