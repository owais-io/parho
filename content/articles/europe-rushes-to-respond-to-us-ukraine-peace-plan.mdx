summary: "European leaders are scrambling to react to a new 28‑point peace plan from the US that was written without Ukraine’s input. The plan, created by Trump’s envoy and a Russian diplomat, has odd wording and includes Russia‑style language. EU officials say the deal must involve Ukraine and that the EU has not yet been fully briefed. While some leaders, like Hungary’s Orbán, back the plan, Ukrainian officials call it unacceptable."
