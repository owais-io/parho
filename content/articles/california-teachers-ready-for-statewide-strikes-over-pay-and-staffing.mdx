title: "California Teachers Ready for Statewide Strikes Over Pay and Staffing"
summary: "Teachers in California’s biggest cities—San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Sacramento—are set to walk out next week if negotiations fail. They want higher wages, lower class sizes, and more special‑education staff. The move is part of the We Can’t Wait campaign, which unites 32 districts to pressure school boards. With 84 % saying they can’t afford to live near their schools, the walkout could shut many schools for a day."
