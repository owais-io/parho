title: "Ukraine Hits Russian Tanker off Libya with Drones"
summary: "Ukraine says it used drones to strike a Russian tanker called the Qendil off Libya’s coast, over 1,200 miles from its borders. The hit is part of a new wave of attacks on Russia’s “shadow fleet” – ships that change flags and evade sanctions to keep oil flowing to Moscow. Kyiv says the damage was critical, with no environmental harm. Putin warned Russia would respond, but the attack is seen as a legitimate move to cut off funding for the war."
