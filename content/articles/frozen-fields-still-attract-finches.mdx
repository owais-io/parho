title: "Frozen Fields Still Attract Finches"
summary: "In a -6 °C winter, a community charity’s wildlife field in Speyside keeps birds busy. The field, planted with pollen‑rich flowers and seed crops, turns icy white but still attracts flocks of finches, green‑ and goldfinches, bramblings and even a hundred linnets. Birds feed on millet and seed pods, turning a frozen patch into a bustling bird haven."
