title: "Nigel Farage’s Davos Trip Cost £50,000, Funded by Billionaire"
summary: "Nigel Farage’s two‑day trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos cost more than £50,000, all paid for by billionaire Sasan Ghandehari. The former UKIP leader took two free passes, accepted £1,100 worth of luxury hotel stay and even spoke at the summit. The trip was recorded on MPs’ interest register, but Farage said he never worked for Ghandehari’s family office. New scrutiny follows a £200,000 donation from a firm that lists the Ghandeharis as a client."
