title: "Chikungunya Mosquito Now Can Spread Across Most of Europe, Study Says"
summary: "A new study shows the Asian tiger mosquito can spread chikungunya across much of Europe as temperatures fall below a lower threshold. In southern countries the disease can circulate for over six months a year, while in central Europe it could spread for 3–5 months. Climate change is pushing the mosquito northward, raising outbreak risk. Prevention relies on mosquito control, personal protection and better surveillance."
