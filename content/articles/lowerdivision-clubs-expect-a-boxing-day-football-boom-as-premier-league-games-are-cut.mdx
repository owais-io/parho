title: "Lower‑division clubs expect a Boxing Day football boom as Premier League games are cut"
summary: "This year only one Premier League match will be played on Boxing Day, so many football fans will turn to lower‑division clubs for the holiday game. Non‑league teams say a home Boxing Day match is a huge commercial and community event, and with fewer top‑tier games they expect record crowds. Some fans are upset that the tradition is gone, but others welcome the chance to watch local football without transport hassles."
