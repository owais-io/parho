title: "NHL Cuts $800,000 Cancer Donation After Missed Shot, Fans React"
summary: "The NHL planned a charity deal where a cancer survivor, Rob Higgins, would shoot a puck at a tiny opening in a goal. If he scored, the league would donate $500,000, but if he missed, it would give $100,000. Higgins missed twice, so the donation dropped to $200,000. Fans online slammed the league, calling it “classless” and upset the $800,000 that went unused."
