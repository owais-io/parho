title: "England Looks Lucky in 2027 Rugby World Cup Draw"
summary: "England’s 2027 Rugby World Cup group looks easy, with Wales, Tonga and Zimbabwe. Their first game will be in Perth on 1 Oct and could pit Australia against New Zealand. In the knockout stage, England could meet France or South Africa in the same half of the bracket, but that would still mean tough matches. Other teams like Ireland, Scotland and Argentina also line up to be hard battles. Overall, the draw gives England a smoother path, but the competition is still fierce."
