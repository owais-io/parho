title: "What Keir Starmer's New Year Talk Means for Labour"
summary: "Keir Starmer opened the new year with a 45‑minute BBC interview that felt more like a polite Q&A than a clear strategy. He stuck to a calm, rehearsed script, repeating that he has a “five‑year mandate” to see Labour’s plans through. He mentioned child poverty, EU ties and defence, but offered no fresh story or bold goals. The result was a careful, process‑oriented talk that left voters wanting more vision."
