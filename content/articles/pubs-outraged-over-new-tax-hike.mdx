title: "Pubs Outraged Over New Tax Hike"
summary: "New business tax rules are pushing pubs into financial trouble. Rates will jump as venues are re‑valued based on expected profits, not rent, causing some to pay 2‑3 times more. Small pubs can’t easily raise prices, so they risk cutting jobs or closing. Owners have set up campaigns and urged politicians to change the rules. The government says it has a support package, but many feel the relief isn’t enough."
