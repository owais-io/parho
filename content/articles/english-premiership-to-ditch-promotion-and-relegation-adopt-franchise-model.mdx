title: "English Premiership to ditch promotion and relegation, adopt franchise model"
summary: "England’s top rugby competition will stop the old system of teams moving up or down each season. From next year, the Premiership will be a closed league of 10 clubs, with two more added in 2029‑30. New clubs can join only through a points‑based application that looks at stadium quality, player development and women's rugby commitments. The change aims to bring financial stability and attract more investment."
