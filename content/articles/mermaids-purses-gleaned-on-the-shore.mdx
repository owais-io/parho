title: "Mermaid’s Purses Gleaned on the Shore"
summary: "A mother and her 4‑year‑old daughter walk along a rough beach as tide comes in. They spot lots of mermaid’s purses – the tough, egg‑case shells left by rays – scattered on the sand. The family collects them in a bucket and records the find with the Shark Trust app for a marine‑research project. The bright green, shiny cases show the pups are recent hatchlings, and the story is a simple family beach adventure."
