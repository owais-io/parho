title: "Why Irish Stone‑Lifting Boulders Are Rounded: A Letter Debate"
summary: "A letter by Alan Woolley challenges Prof Gray’s claim that the rounded stones used in Ireland’s ancient stone‑lifting sport are glacial erratics. Woolley says rivers and sea currents more likely smooth the rocks. The letter is printed beside a brief update that the Green Party won the Gorton and Denton byelection, pushing Labour to third place. A comment notes voters prefer plumbers to politics professors, and a quiz question about red blood cells ends the piece."
