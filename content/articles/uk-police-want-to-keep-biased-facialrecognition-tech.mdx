title: "UK police want to keep biased facial‑recognition tech"
summary: "Police in the UK decided to keep using a facial‑recognition system that the government says is biased against women, young people and ethnic minorities. A study by the National Physical Laboratory found the tool misidentified Black and Asian people and women far more often than white men. After raising the confidence level to cut bias, forces complained the system produced fewer leads, so the change was undone. The Home Office says a new, less‑biased algorithm will be tested next year."
