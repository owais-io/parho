title: "UK deaths from synthetic opioids may be undercounted"
summary: "Researchers say that deaths from nitazenes, a super‑potent synthetic opioid, may have been counted too low by up to a third. The study looked at how the drug breaks down after death and found only 14% of it can still be detected. Modelling shows an extra 30% of deaths in Birmingham last year, meaning many overdose victims are missed. The findings warn that policy and harm‑reduction plans are based on wrong numbers, risking more preventable deaths."
