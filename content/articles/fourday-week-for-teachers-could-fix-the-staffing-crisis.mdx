title: "Four‑Day Week for Teachers Could Fix the Staffing Crisis"
summary: "Teachers in England are overworked, doing unpaid overtime and missing family time. Many quit, leaving schools short of staff, especially for subjects like physics. A group suggests a four‑day week in the classroom, with a flexible fifth day for grading and prep, so the extra work is built into the paid hours. Schools would stay open five days, so parents need not pay for extra childcare. Trials show happier staff and even better results, and the move could cut costs."
