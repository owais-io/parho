title: "London Police to Test Handheld Facial‑Recognition Cameras"
summary: "London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has green‑lit a six‑month trial in which about 100 Metropolitan Police officers will carry handheld facial‑recognition devices to check people’s identities during stops. The move has sparked worry from civil‑liberties groups and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which warn about false matches and racial bias. The police say the tech can quickly confirm suspects and reduce unnecessary detentions, but critics demand clear rules and independent oversight."
