title: "Jewish groups oppose NSW plan to ban protests after Bondi shooting"
summary: "NSW Premier Chris Minns wants to stop protests when a “terrorism designation” is in place, saying it would hurt community harmony. Two Jewish organisations that support the Palestine movement say the move unfairly targets pro‑Palestine rallies and could silence political debate. They warn that politics and antisemitism should be kept separate and that banning protests could undermine democratic freedoms. Civil‑liberties groups also call the plan too restrictive."
