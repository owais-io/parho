title: "Jupiter Stays Bright in Gemini Tonight"
summary: "Jupiter has stayed in the Gemini constellation for the whole month, making it a reliable point in the evening sky. Its bright glow cuts through city lights, so even in urban areas it can be spotted easily. Jupiter sits between the twin stars Castor and Pollux, outshining them. Unlike stars, it doesn’t twinkle, which helps tell it apart. Its slow drift can be followed night after night, giving a clear sense of the solar system’s motion."
