title: "Insurance Companies Keep Raising Auto‑Renewal Prices"
summary: "A long‑time AA member’s son discovered his premiums had jumped after his dad died. When he tried to move the account to his mother’s name to cut costs, the AA refused. This mirrors a broader problem highlighted by Adrian Chiles: insurers still auto‑renew at higher rates, even though the FCA says existing customers shouldn’t be charged more than new ones. Many readers are urged to check their auto‑renewals and threaten to leave for better deals."
