title: "Trump’s move on Venezuela isn’t about freedom"
summary: "Trump’s actions in Venezuela aren’t about freeing people. He lifted protection for 600,000 Venezuelan refugees and deported many to dangerous countries. He also banned travel from 39 nations, many of which aren’t free. The U.S. wants to keep Maduro in power and support the vice‑president, not a democratic election. The article points out that the U.S. has similar human‑rights problems, like arrests and deaths of migrants. In short, the move is driven by power, not liberty."
