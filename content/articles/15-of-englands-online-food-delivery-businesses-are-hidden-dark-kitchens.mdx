title: "15% of England’s Online Food Delivery Businesses Are Hidden “Dark Kitchens”"
summary: "Study shows one in seven food delivery services in England are “dark kitchens” – restaurants that only cook for delivery and have no storefront. Researchers made the first clear definition and mapped their spread on apps like Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Because they’re invisible, regulators can’t enforce normal food‑safety rules. The report warns that this could increase unhealthy take‑away and allergens, urging stricter rules and clearer labels for consumers."
