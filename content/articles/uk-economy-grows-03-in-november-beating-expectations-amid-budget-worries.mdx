title: "UK economy grows 0.3% in November, beating expectations amid budget worries"
summary: "UK’s economy grew 0.3% in November, better than the 0.1% drop in October and the 0.1% growth forecast. The jump comes after the carmaker Jaguar Land Rover’s cyber‑attack shut production, but its recovery helped lift vehicle output. Services and manufacturing grew, though construction fell. The data give a boost to chancellor Rachel Reeves as she pushes a budget aimed at easing uncertainty and encouraging spending."
