title: "UK backs Ineos plant with £120m – but what about other heavy‑industry sites?"
summary: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK will help places like Grangemouth. He backed the Ineos ethylene plant with £120m, but the article asks whether that means a clear plan for other factories. Other sites – an oil refinery, an ExxonMobil plant, and British Steel – have faced closures or unclear support. The government has mixed policies on energy, carbon taxes and a slow energy‑cost relief plan, so workers aren’t sure what’s next."
