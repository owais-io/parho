title: "Labour Leaders Face a Tough Decision on EU Customs Union"
summary: "Keir Starmer’s Labour Party is being urged to re‑join the EU customs union. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said a customs union would give Labour a clear message to voters—80 % of Labour supporters want it, and 73 % want a full EU return. The government argues it would break existing free‑trade deals with the US and India, and negotiating with Brussels is costly and slow. As the next election nears, Starmer may struggle to resist growing pressure for a closer European tie‑up."
