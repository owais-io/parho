title: "Media Workers of Color Fired Amid Trump‑Era Cuts to Diversity Programs"
summary: "CBS, NBC and Teen Vogue have cut jobs, with people of color fired more often than white staff. The cuts come after Trump’s executive orders that aimed to stop DEI programs. Journalists say white colleagues were kept, while Black, Latino and Asian workers were let go. The layoffs sparked outrage and led to a new black‑owned media group forming. This shows a growing trend of media companies removing diversity voices, prompting employees to create independent outlets."
