title: "Small Ponds in Britain Are Bringing Back Wildlife and Helping the Climate"
summary: "A tiny garden pond I built has attracted frogs, hedgehogs and birds. Ponds like this are important because they give animals a place to live and help keep the weather mild. In Britain, most ponds have disappeared over the last 120 years. Scientists say more than half are gone, making it harder for wildlife. Now people are starting to build more small ponds again. They help cool hot days, slow heavy rain, and recharge groundwater."
