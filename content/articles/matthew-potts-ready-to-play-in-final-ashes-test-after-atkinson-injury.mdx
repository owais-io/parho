title: "Matthew Potts Ready to Play in Final Ashes Test After Atkinson Injury"
summary: "Matthew Potts is likely to play his first Ashes Test in Sydney after England ruled out Gus Atkinson for a hamstring injury. Atkinson’s exit, along with early injuries to Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, leaves Potts as the last unused seamer. If other key players recover, England will keep a similar lineup, with spin option Will Jacks staying on. Potts would earn his 11th Test cap and bring fresh energy to the side."
