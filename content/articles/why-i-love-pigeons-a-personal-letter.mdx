title: "Why I Love Pigeons: A Personal Letter"
summary: "I write about watching two wood pigeons on my windowsill during lockdown. They built a nest, hatched chicks, and kept coming back each year. Watching the family grow made me admire pigeons as hardworking parents. I share facts: they mate for life, can drink water without tilting their heads, and sing with closed beaks. I now make pigeon sculptures that sell well, and I feel proud of these humble city heroes."
