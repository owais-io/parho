title: "Texas Democrats Beat Christian Nationalists in Senate Race"
summary: "Chris Tackett has spent years mapping how Christian‑nationalist donors fund Texas politicians. He and his wife ran a group called See It. Name. Fight It. In Tarrant County, a Democrat named Taylor Rehmet beat a wealthy Republican who had money from those donors. The win was credited to grassroots work and low turnout for the GOP. Data shows many voters who usually back Republicans actually voted for the Democrat. The result shows local organizing can defeat big money in Texas."
