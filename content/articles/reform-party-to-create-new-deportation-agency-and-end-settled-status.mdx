title: "Reform Party to Create New Deportation Agency and End Settled Status"
summary: "Reform party says it will set up a new agency like the U.S. ICE to deport up to 288,000 people a year and scrap the permanent ‘indefinite leave to remain’ status that lets many long‑time residents stay in the UK. It also plans to stop churches turning into mosques, boost stop‑and‑search powers and tighten its counter‑extremism program. Labour says the plans would unfairly target settled families and widen Britain’s divide."
