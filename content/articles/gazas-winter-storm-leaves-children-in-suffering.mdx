title: "Gaza’s Winter Storm Leaves Children in Suffering"
summary: "I’m writing from Gaza, where a heavy winter storm is soaking tents and chilling children. Streets are empty, only the sound of rain and the screams of kids in wet blankets. Two children died when a damaged roof collapsed, and an infant died of the cold. Schools are online from tents, but there’s no heat or electricity. Aid has brought only tarpaulins and blankets—insufficient. The author urges that real, warm shelters be delivered immediately."
