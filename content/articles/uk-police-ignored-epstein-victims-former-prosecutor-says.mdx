title: "UK police ignored Epstein victims, former prosecutor says"
summary: "A former top prosecutor, Nazir Afzal, says British police act fast when state interests are involved but slow or ignore allegations against women, especially in the Jeffrey Epstein case. He highlights that investigations into flights, sexual assault claims, and trafficking have barely begun, and urges a single national investigator, like the NCA, to handle the evidence. While police coordinate, victims feel overlooked and call for a stronger, faster response."
