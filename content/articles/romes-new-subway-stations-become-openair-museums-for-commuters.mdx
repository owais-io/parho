title: "Rome’s new subway stations become open‑air museums for commuters"
summary: "Rome’s Metro C just added two new stations that let passengers see real ancient history while they travel. Colosseo‑Fori Imperiali, near the Colosseum, shows Roman houses, baths, 28 old wells and dozens of pottery pieces behind glass. Porta Metronia, in San Giovanni, uncovered a 2nd‑century military barracks with frescoes and mosaics. The stations open now, but the full museum display will finish early next year. The new stops also extend the line by about 3 km."
