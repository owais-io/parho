title: "Why I’m proud to work for the Guardian"
summary: "During New York election day, a poll worker thanked her when she said she writes for the Guardian. She explains why she loves the paper: it’s fair, accurate, and doesn’t treat Trump like a normal politician. The Guardian’s mission‑driven style, no strict paywall, and diverse voices keep it open to everyone. It’s run by the Scott Trust, not a profit‑driven company, so it stays independent and supports democracy."
