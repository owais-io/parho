summary: "A 19‑year‑old Ukrainian refugee named Kateryna Endeberia left a UK sixth‑form college after teachers pushed her to study Russian, a language she says would hurt her because her father is a soldier. She said she was bullied for her accent and got no extra help. Kateryna has quit the college, is studying from home, and will take A‑levels privately next year while she files a complaint."
