title: "Trump Targets Venezuela, Could Move to Other Countries"
summary: "After seeing Russia declare parts of Ukraine independent, Trump thought about using the same idea against Venezuela. He ordered air strikes to try to oust President Maduro, hoping to install a friend and open the country to U.S. influence and oil. The plan backfired when Venezuela’s vice‑president refused to step down. Trump’s move shows a pattern of quick military hits and a belief that America can dominate the Western Hemisphere. He may soon aim at other countries."
