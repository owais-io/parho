title: "Australian Suburbs at Risk of Huge Wildfires Like Los Angeles"
summary: "A new report says almost 7 million people living on the edges of Australia’s big cities could face deadly wildfires like those that hit Los Angeles in 2025. Many homes are older and not built to modern bushfire rules, and they sit next to forests or grass that can ignite quickly. Strong winds, dry weather, and steep hills add to the danger. Experts say the government must invest more in fire plans, help firefighters, and upgrade houses to survive a blaze."
