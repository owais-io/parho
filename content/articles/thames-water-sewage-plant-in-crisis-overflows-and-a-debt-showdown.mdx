title: "Thames Water Sewage Plant in Crisis: Overflows and a Debt Showdown"
summary: "Maple Lodge, Thames Water’s largest sewage plant, was built in the 1950s and still lacks modern capacity. During heavy rain it has discharged raw sewage into the River Colne, prompting a £104m fine from regulators. An upgrade that should have finished in 2024 is now only scheduled for 2030, with costs rising to £300‑400m. Meanwhile, the company’s debt talks with bondholders and the government could bring a new ownership deal or even nationalisation, affecting water bills and future investment."
