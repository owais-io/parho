summary: "A government plan called Job‑Ready Graduates (JRG) aimed to steer students toward STEM subjects, but it has made it harder for low‑income families to study law and other expensive degrees. Enrolments of low‑socioeconomic students fell by almost 10% between 2020 and 2024, with law degrees dropping 17.7%. Senators and universities now want the scheme scrapped, saying it creates a two‑track system that favours wealthier students."
