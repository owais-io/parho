summary: "The Supreme Court ruled that President Trump had gone beyond his authority by imposing tariffs on imports without congressional approval. The judge said the law Trump used, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, doesn’t give him that power. Trump isn’t giving up—he said he will use another law, the Trade Act of 1974, to keep tariffs in place. Businesses now face uncertainty as the U.S. tries to keep its trade war going."
