title: "Davos leaders admit the old world order is ending, but action is needed"
summary: "Mark Carney told a Davos audience that the world’s rules‑based order is disappearing and can’t be reversed. He said that the system that relied on international bodies, agreed‑upon norms and liberal ideals has been undermined by the U.S. and its allies, especially after the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Gaza conflict. Carney calls for new ways to replace the old structure, but notes that many of the same power rules still exist."
