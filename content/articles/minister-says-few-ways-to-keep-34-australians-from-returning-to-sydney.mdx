title: "Minister Says Few Ways to Keep 34 Australians from Returning to Sydney"
summary: "Australian Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said he has little power to stop 34 Australian women and children who live in a Syrian detention camp from returning to the country. He can only use temporary exclusion orders, which one woman has already received. Burke warned that comments from politician Pauline Hanson could spark violence and that opposition leaders are not using the law decisively. Meanwhile the camp’s conditions are worsening and may close."
