title: "Microshifting: Working in Short Blocks to Fit Your Life"
summary: "Microshifting is a new way to work in short, separate blocks so you can fit jobs and life together. It lets you work for an hour, then do whatever you need—like exercise or childcare—then work again later. About 30% of hybrid workers have side gigs, and 51% already slot personal tasks into regular hours. Gen Z does it more (61%). Workers say they’d trade a bit of pay for more flexibility, and it might even boost productivity. Employers should adapt."
