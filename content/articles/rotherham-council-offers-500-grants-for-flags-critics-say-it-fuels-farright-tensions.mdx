summary: "Rotherham’s Labour‑led council announced a £500 grant to help community groups put up Union Jack or St George’s flag poles, saying it would promote unity and keep national symbols from extremist control. The move has sparked backlash from activists who call it “flag terror” and fear it gives far‑right groups a platform.
