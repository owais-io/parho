title: "Google's AI Health Summaries Could Mislead Patients"
summary: "Google added a new feature that shows short AI‑generated summaries above search results. It can answer health questions, but the answers sometimes give wrong or harmful advice. For example, it told people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high‑fat foods and gave false liver‑test info. Experts say the summaries rely on unreliable sources like YouTube and can make users stop looking for real doctors. Google has pulled some answers but worries remain."
