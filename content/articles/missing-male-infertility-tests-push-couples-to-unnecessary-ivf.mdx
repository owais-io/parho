title: "Missing Male Infertility Tests Push Couples to Unnecessary IVF"
summary: "Many couples are going through IVF even though the problem is on the male side. In the UK doctors rarely test men for simple, treatable causes like a varicocele, and the NHS has few specialists. This oversight means men wait years for a diagnosis while women get quick fertility tests. Experts say better training, more men’s health research, and early testing could cut costs and ease the mental strain of infertility."
