title: "Plaid Cymru Upsets Reform in Caerphilly Byelection"
summary: "Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, beat Reform UK in the Caerphilly byelection, even though they spent half as much money as the big parties. The win surprised everyone and shows that Labour’s support in Wales is slipping. New polls suggest Plaid could win a lot more seats in the May Senedd elections, and a coalition with the Greens could bring Welsh independence back into the debate."
