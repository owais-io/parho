title: "France's Restaurants Are Closing Fast"
summary: "France’s restaurants are in trouble. Every day about 25 close because food costs are high, people eat less out, and delivery services like Uber Eats dominate. The pandemic hurt too – fewer workers in offices, more lunchboxes, and taxes that favor take‑away over dining in. Fast‑food chains survive, but small cafés and bars struggle with staff shortages and higher prices. The government has helped, but the crisis keeps growing."
