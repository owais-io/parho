title: "Did Trump’s Trade Wars Hurt or Help Australia?"
summary: "One year after Trump’s trade wars, Australia has surprised many. Economists warned the tariffs would hurt growth, but exports—especially beef and gold—doubled, lifting the economy. The global market has bent, not broken, with other countries finding new buyers. Inflation is climbing and the RBA may raise rates, but growth remains positive. The future is shaky with AI risks, trade tensions and policy uncertainty."
