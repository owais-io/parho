summary: "Met Police ordered over 300 officers and staff to tell bosses if they belong to groups like the Freemasons. About 316 people have said yes. Freemason groups sued to stop the policy, saying it discriminates against them and violates rights. A judge said there is no urgent need to pause the policy and that no punishments will come for those who refuse to declare.
