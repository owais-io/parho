title: "Why Monogamy Is Cracking: What Animals Teach Us"
summary: "More people are choosing open or non‑monogamous relationships, and surveys show that a big chunk of young adults think strict monogamy isn’t realistic. A Cambridge study ranked human pair‑bonding among the top mammals, but it isn’t the most monogamous. The research suggests humans are naturally flexible, and our changing relationships are just another step in how we evolve socially."
