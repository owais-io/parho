title: "Train derails in Switzerland as deadly Alpine avalanches spread across the Alps"
summary: "Heavy snow in the Alps has caused deadly avalanches, injuring people and killing skiers in France, Italy and Switzerland. A train near Goppenstein derailed after an avalanche, injuring five. Over the past week, 13 off‑piste skiers and hikers died in the Italian Alps alone. The risk level is at its highest (grade 5) because of recent storms, wind‑driven snow and a weak snowpack. Authorities warn that even a single skier can trigger an avalanche."
