title: "Iran Protesters Need Support, Not Western Bombing"
summary: "Iran’s people are protesting a brutal theocratic regime that has killed hundreds and jailed thousands. The government cut off the internet to control the news, but human‑rights groups say at least 544 people died and 10,000+ were arrested. The protests were sparked partly by economic hardship from sanctions, but many Iranians simply want freedom from a dictatorship. Western powers—especially the United States—have a long record of interfering in the Middle East, often with disastrous results. Instead of bombing Iran, we should support the Iranians’ right to self‑determination."
