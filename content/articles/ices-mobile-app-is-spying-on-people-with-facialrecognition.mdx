title: "ICE’s Mobile App Is Spying on People with Facial‑Recognition"
summary: "ICE’s new Mobile Fortify app uses facial‑recognition and “contactless fingerprints” to scan anyone in the street. Since May 2025 it’s been used over 100,000 times – even on children – and feeds data into a database of 200 million images. Agents treat a match as proof someone isn’t a U.S. citizen, ignoring birth certificates. The app keeps every photo for 15 years and has shown bias, misidentifying people of colour. Critics say it turns the U.S. into a mass‑surveillance state, erasing privacy."
