title: "House approves Trump‑backed voting bill that would tighten rules"
summary: "The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the Save America Act, a Trump‑backed voting‑law bill that would tighten election rules. The bill requires proof of citizenship for voter registration, adds a strict photo‑ID requirement, and would curb mail‑in voting. It passed 218‑213, with only one Democrat joining Republicans. Critics say the rules could shut out millions of voters, especially people of color and the poor, and may face Senate and court hurdles."
