title: "**Labour Unveils Plan to Lift 550,000 Children Out of Poverty by 2030**"
summary: "Labour says it will lift about 550,000 kids out of poverty by 2030, mainly by ending the two‑child benefit cap that costs £3 bn. It also adds an £8 m pilot to move families out of temporary housing and requires councils to tell schools and doctors when a child is in temporary accommodation. Charities welcome the step but want tighter targets; Conservatives say the cost is too high."
