title: "Trump’s Stop Order Against Offshore Wind Projects Is Overruled"
summary: "Construction on four offshore wind projects has resumed after federal judges overruled President Trump’s stop order. Trump had halted five projects in December, citing national‑security concerns that critics say are a pretext. The projects will add almost 5 gigawatts of clean power, enough for 3.5 million homes, and are key for the northeast’s energy needs. The wind industry remains hopeful but faces a tough political climate."
