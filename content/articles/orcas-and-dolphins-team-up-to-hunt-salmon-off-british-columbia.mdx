title: "Orcas and dolphins team up to hunt salmon off British Columbia"
summary: "Scientists watching whales and dolphins in British Columbia found the two species work together to catch salmon. Dolphins fly ahead, spotting fish, while killer whales follow. When the whales bite the salmon they split the meal, and the dolphins get the scraps. Researchers used drones, underwater cameras and tags to watch the interactions. The study suggests the animals might help each other, not just use each other for food."
