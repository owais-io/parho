title: "Why Politicians Aren't Opposing Data Centers"
summary: "Michigan voters and groups from across the political spectrum joined forces to stop more than a dozen data‑center projects. A state bill to remove tax breaks for these sites has almost no co‑sponsors, so most plans still look set to go ahead. Big tech, fossil‑fuel firms, utilities and even some unions back data centers, while many lawmakers don’t fully grasp the local costs. Grassroots activists call for a pause or stricter rules, hoping the issue will gain traction in 2026."
