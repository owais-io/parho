summary: "More than a dozen environmental and public‑health groups have sued the Trump‑era EPA after it scrapped the “endangerment finding” that lets the agency limit greenhouse gas emissions. The lawsuit, filed in Washington DC court, argues the rollback hurts public health and violates the Clean Air Act.
