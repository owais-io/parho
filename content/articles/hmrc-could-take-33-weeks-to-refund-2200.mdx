title: "HMRC Could Take 33 Weeks to Refund £2,200"
summary: "A NHS worker who paid too much National Insurance says HMRC owes him £2,200 but could take 33 weeks to pay it back. The refund system has slowed after Covid, and the government says it is hiring more staff to clear backlogs. While some refunds now take months, the worker’s own money arrived in just a week after a quick phone call. The long wait is raising questions about whether this delay is becoming the new normal."
