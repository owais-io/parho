title: "Trump’s plans for Venezuela break international law"
summary: "The letter says Donald Trump’s promises to run Venezuela, stay until a new government is chosen, and let US oil firms run the country are illegal under international law. The writer explains that using force to change a government is forbidden unless a UN Security Council says so, which isn’t the case. The letter warns that ignoring this rule could undermine laws that keep countries from invading each other, like the Russia‑Ukraine war. It calls on Europe and other nations to unite and oppose such unlawful actions."
