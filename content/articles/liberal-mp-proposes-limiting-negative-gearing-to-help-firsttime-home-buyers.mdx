title: "Liberal MP Proposes Limiting Negative Gearing to Help First‑Time Home Buyers"
summary: "Former Liberal MP Keith Wolahan suggests capping negative gearing to one existing rental property and five new builds. He says this would free up more houses for young renters, like a 32‑year‑old university graduate in Melbourne, and help the party win back voters it lost to Labor. The idea is to grandfather existing investors, but experts argue it would barely change the market."
