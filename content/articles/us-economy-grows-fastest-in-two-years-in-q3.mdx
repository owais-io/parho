title: "US Economy Grows Fastest in Two Years in Q3"
summary: "The U.S. economy grew 4.3% annualized in the third quarter, the fastest rate in two years, driven by higher consumer spending, exports and government spending, though investment fell. Economists had expected a slower 3.2% growth. While consumer confidence slipped, the strong GDP data complicates the Fed’s next rate move – it must balance high inflation against a weak job market. The numbers were delayed by a government shutdown, and trade tariffs still loom."
