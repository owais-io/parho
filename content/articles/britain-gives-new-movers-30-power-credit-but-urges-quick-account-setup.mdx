title: "Britain gives new movers £30 power credit but urges quick account set‑up"
summary: "When you move to a new home in Britain, the regulator will give you a £30 credit that covers about two weeks of power. After that you must open a new energy account or your power will be cut off. The move is meant to speed up account set‑ups and cut Britain’s huge energy debt. If you’ve moved recently, check if you’re owed a refund from a closed account."
