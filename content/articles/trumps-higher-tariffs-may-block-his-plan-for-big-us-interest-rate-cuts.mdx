summary: "Trump lifted US tariffs to 15% after the Supreme Court blocked his earlier plan, raising import costs and keeping inflation high. He wants the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but the new Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, faces pressure to keep rates steady or even raise them to tame inflation. The higher tariffs and supply‑chain strains make it harder for the Fed to cut rates, hurting Trump’s economic agenda."
