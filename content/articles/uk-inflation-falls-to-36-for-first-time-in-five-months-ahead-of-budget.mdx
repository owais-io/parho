title: "UK inflation falls to 3.6% for first time in five months ahead of budget"
summary: "UK inflation fell to 3.6% in October, the lowest level in five months, easing the Bank of England’s chances of cutting rates. The drop was driven by slower rises in gas, electricity and hotel prices, but food inflation climbed to 4.9%. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will use next week’s budget to try to lower living costs, possibly cutting energy VAT and reviewing dental costs. Markets now see a high chance of a rate cut in December."
