title: "Nighttime Badger Fight Outside My Home"
summary: "I woke at 2 a.m. to loud screams. I thought someone was being attacked, but it turned out to be two badgers battling near my house. They ran back and forth, then fought again, and finally fled into the woods. Badgers are especially active in February when cubs are born, so their quarrel was normal for the season. I even called down to them, asking if they mind, and they froze, looked up, and then vanished into the trees."
