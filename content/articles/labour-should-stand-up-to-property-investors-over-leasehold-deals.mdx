title: "Labour Should Stand Up to Property Investors Over Leasehold Deals"
summary: "Ground rents in England and Wales are rising steeply, hurting about 1 million leaseholders. The government has promised a ban on new leasehold flats and a cap of £250 on existing ground rents, but the measures are slow and many problems remain, like unfair freeholder prices and the threat of forfeiture. Labour has been cautious, but voters expect the party to push harder for reform."
