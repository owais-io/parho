title: "Labour names Prof Brian Bell as Treasury chief economic adviser to tackle skills shortage and low pay"
summary: "Labour has appointed Professor Brian Bell, head of the Migration Advisory Committee, as the Treasury’s chief economic adviser. Bell wants to fix the UK’s skills shortage by improving pay and working conditions, especially in social care, so fewer jobs are filled by migrants. He argues that the sharp drop in net migration is because employers pay too little and work is too hard. His role comes as the government plans to raise wages and reduce migration."
