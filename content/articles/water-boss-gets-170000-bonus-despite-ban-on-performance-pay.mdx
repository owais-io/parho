title: "Water boss gets £170,000 bonus despite ban on performance pay"
summary: "Wessex Water’s former chief executive, Colin Skellett, got a £170,000 bonus from its parent company YTL even though the government has banned bonuses for water bosses after a criminal conviction over a sewage spill that killed fish. Skellett’s total pay from YTL was over £700,000, and he kept a large salary after leaving Wessex. The bonus was allowed because it was linked to a different part of YTL’s business. Critics say this shows the ban isn’t strong enough."
