title: "Tories Seek Release of Peter Mandelson’s US Ambassador Vetting Papers"
summary: "Conservatives want the UK government to hand over all documents that were checked before Peter Mandelson was named ambassador to the US. They will use a rare parliamentary tool called a humble address to force the release of emails, text messages and other papers that show whether his links to Jeffrey Epstein were known. Labour MPs are not ready to vote against the move, while police investigate possible leaks. Mandelson has already stepped down from the House of Lords."
