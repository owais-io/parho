title: "Greenland’s Futsal Team Aims for International Recognition in Croatia"
summary: "Greenland’s futsal squad has travelled to Croatia for a week‑long tournament called Futsal Week, where they can play teams that usually outshine them. Because Greenland isn’t recognised by the main football bodies, the team can’t enter official competitions, so each match is a chance to prove themselves. They beat Romania in the first game but eventually fell 8‑4, showing both promise and frustration. Their coach says the experience helps build confidence and global respect for the tiny nation."
