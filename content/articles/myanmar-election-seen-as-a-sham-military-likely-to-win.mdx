summary: "After the polls closed, most voters in Myanmar felt the election was a sham. The military junta has banned the main opposition party, arrested critics, and used force in the streets. People voted mainly out of fear, and turnout was low. The ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party is set to win, while international bodies say the vote lacks legitimacy. The country remains in conflict, with many displaced and prices rising."
