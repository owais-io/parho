title: "Ryder Cup 2023: A Wild Mix of Politics, Fans, and a Losing US Team"
summary: "During the 2023 Ryder Cup at Bethpage, the author felt a chaotic mix of politics and fan drama. Slogans on shirts, heckling, and strange encounters—like a woman shouting about Trump and a driver scolding a fan—made the event feel more like a protest than a golf match. Meanwhile, the US team underperformed, leaving fans disappointed. The day was filled with security, odd incidents, and a sense that the sport was lost in the noise."
