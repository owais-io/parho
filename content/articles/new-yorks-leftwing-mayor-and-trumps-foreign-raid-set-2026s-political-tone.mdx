title: "New York’s left‑wing mayor and Trump’s foreign raid set 2026’s political tone"
summary: "On Jan 1, New York elected its first democratic‑socialist mayor, Zohran Mamdani, who promised rent freezes, free bus rides and universal childcare. A day later, former President Trump announced a secret raid on Venezuela to try to change its government. The two events show a clear split in U.S. politics: the left pushing social programs, the right using military action to boost popularity. Both will influence the 2026 midterm elections."
