title: "UK Banks Are Bringing Branches Back to the High Street"
summary: "After years of cutting branches, UK banks are holding back closures and even opening new ones. HSBC, Nationwide and others promise to keep hundreds of shops open until 2027‑2030, while smaller lenders like Metro Bank add fresh sites. Older customers still prefer face‑to‑face help, and younger people also visit branches to deposit cash or get advice. Banks are turning branches into advisory hubs, focusing on personalized service and using tech to boost efficiency."
