title: "Bronze‑Age Villagers Used Kids’ Skulls to Ward Off Floods"
summary: "Scientists in Basel found children’s skulls around lake villages in what is now Germany and Switzerland. The skulls were buried after death, dug up later, and arranged in a circle. Researchers think this was a symbolic barrier—an apotropaic charm—to protect homes from rising water, not a sacrifice. The villages built other defenses like stilts and stone walls, but the skull circle appears as a last‑ditch spiritual measure before floods."
