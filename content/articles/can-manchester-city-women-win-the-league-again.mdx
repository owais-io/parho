title: "Can Manchester City Women Win the League Again?"
summary: "Manchester City Women are now the clear leaders of the Women’s Super League, with a six‑point cushion after nine straight wins. They beat Leicester 3‑0, thanks to Khadija Shaw’s goals and clever crossing from the wings. The team’s high‑cross, high‑corner style is working, and fresh players are making an impact. With no European matches to worry about, they have a good chance to claim the title, though some key players will miss games for the Asian Cup."
