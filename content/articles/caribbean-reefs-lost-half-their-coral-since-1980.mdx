title: "Caribbean reefs lost half their coral since 1980"
summary: "A study finds Caribbean reefs now have only half the hard coral they had in 1980, a 48% drop. Heatwaves bleach coral by killing the algae that feed it, and storms add damage. When coral dies, seaweed takes over. The reefs support many fish and bring billions of dollars to the region. Researchers found resilient coral in Mexico and created a new protected area, showing reefs can recover if we curb climate change and local threats."
