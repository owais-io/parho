title: "Finnish herders unsure if Russian wolves caused record reindeer deaths"
summary: "Finnish reindeer herders have seen an unprecedented number of animals killed by wolves in 2025, with over 2,100 confirmed deaths. Many believe the surge is due to an influx of Russian wolves moving north after hunting restrictions eased during the Ukraine war, but scientists say the evidence is inconclusive. Finland has lifted its wolf hunting ban and will allow controlled culls to curb population growth. Researchers are still trying to confirm the wolves’ origins with DNA tests."
