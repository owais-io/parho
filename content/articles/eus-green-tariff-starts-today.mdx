title: "EU’s green tariff starts today"
summary: "EU's new green tariff starts today, requiring exporters of high‑carbon goods like steel, cement and aluminium to show their products meet low‑carbon standards or face fines. The rule aims to level the playing field with non‑EU producers and stop ‘carbon leakage.’ Initially it covers iron, steel, aluminium, cement, hydrogen, electricity and fertilisers. UK firms will soon introduce a similar system, but a carbon‑market link with the EU is still pending."
