title: "Treasury Not Fully Aware of Risks from Growing Shadow Banking"
summary: "The UK Treasury is said to barely understand the risks posed by the booming shadow banking sector, a report from the Lords financial services committee says. The unregulated industry, worth about $16 trillion, could threaten the wider financial system, but the Treasury’s data is limited and its response is seen as passive. The report warns that Britain could face the first shocks if the US‑driven private‑credit market falters. Regulators are starting stress tests, while Treasury says it will review the findings."
