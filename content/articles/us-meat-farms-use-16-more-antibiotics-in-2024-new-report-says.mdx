title: "US meat farms use 16% more antibiotics in 2024, new report says"
summary: "Antibiotic use in U.S. meat production rose 16% in 2024, the biggest jump since data began. The spike involves drugs that also treat people, sparking fears of more drug‑resistant bacteria. Chicken and turkey use jumped 80% and 25%, while beef and pork are climbing again after a long dip. Factory farms often favor cheaper antibiotics over better housing, and enforcement is weak. Buying organic or looking for clear labels may help consumers avoid the drugs."
