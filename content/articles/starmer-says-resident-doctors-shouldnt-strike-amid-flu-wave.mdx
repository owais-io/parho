title: "Starmer says resident doctors shouldn’t strike amid flu wave"
summary: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said resident doctors should not strike during this year's flu wave, warning that the strikes would endanger the NHS already overloaded. He criticised the government’s weak offer for doctors’ union BMA, which demands better terms. A flu outbreak is hitting hospitals hard, especially for older people, many of whom aren’t vaccinated. Public opinion is mixed, but most people oppose the strikes planned for Dec 17‑22."
