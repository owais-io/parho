title: "Monterey Park Residents Stop Big Data Center"
summary: "Monterey Park, a small California city, stopped a plan to build a huge data center that would use a lot of power and create noise. A group called No Data Center Monterey Park, with local community groups, organized rallies, made flyers in English, Chinese and Spanish, and gathered almost 5,000 signatures. Their pressure forced the city council to pause the project for 45 days and promise to explore a ban. The victory shows how local action can challenge big‑tech projects."
