title: "HSBC Cuts Mortgage Rates First Among Big UK Banks"
summary: "HSBC is the first major UK lender to lower mortgage rates this year. The change, effective Monday, follows the Bank of England’s December rate cut to 3.75%. The move is likely to prompt other banks to follow, sparking a “rate war” that could bring even lower offers for borrowers. About 1.8 million homeowners may refinance this year, and new fixed‑rate deals could drop below 3.5% before spring."
