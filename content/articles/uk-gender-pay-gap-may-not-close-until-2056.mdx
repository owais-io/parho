title: "UK gender pay gap may not close until 2056"
summary: "A TUC report says the UK's gender pay gap will only close in 2056 if progress stays the same. Women earn £2,548 less per year, meaning they’ve essentially worked for free for the first 1.5 months. The gap widens as women age because of unpaid care work. Sectors vary: some pay more, some pay less. New laws may help, but tougher plans are needed."
