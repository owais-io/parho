title: "US executions rise to 16‑year high in 2025"
summary: "Last year, 47 people were executed in the US, the most in 16 years and twice the 2024 total. President Trump’s new order to bring back the death penalty and a Supreme Court that has refused to halt executions pushed the rise. Four states—Florida, Alabama, Texas, and South Carolina—carried out the bulk of them, using methods like nitrogen gas and a firing squad. Despite this, public opinion is against the death penalty, with more than half of Americans now opposed."
