title: "Teachers say a four‑day week is a must, not a perk"
summary: "Teachers in England work a lot of unpaid overtime, about 26 extra hours a week, which cuts into their pay. They juggle teaching, behaviour management, paperwork, and caring for students, leaving little time for rest or family. The result is high burnout, more sickness, and many teachers leaving the job. A four‑day week would give them a protected day to plan and recover, helping them stay in the profession and improve teaching quality."
