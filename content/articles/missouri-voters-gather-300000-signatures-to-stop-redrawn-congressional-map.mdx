title: "Missouri Voters Gather 300,000 Signatures to Stop Redrawn Congressional Map"
summary: "Missouri voters have collected more than 300,000 signatures to stop a new congressional map that favors Republicans. The group, People Not Politicians, says the signatures far exceed the 100,000 needed to block the map. If the Secretary of State verifies them, the map will be paused and a public vote scheduled for next year. Republicans are fighting the effort, but many voters want fair district lines."
