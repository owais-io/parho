title: "Sicilian Firefighters Save 400 Rare Books From Library Hanging Over Landslide"
summary: "In Niscemi, Sicily, a January landslide left a library perched on a steep drop. Firefighters worked in careful bursts, drilling into the building, moving bookcases, and hauling out about 400 precious books. They used drones, lasers, and sensors to watch the shaky structure. The library holds rare books from before 1830, including a 16th‑century volume. Rescue is still risky as the slope could slide again."
