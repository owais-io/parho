title: "Young Homeless People Lose Too Much When They Earn More"
summary: "Many young people aged 16‑24 who are homeless and living in supported housing get help, but the rules mean they lose a lot of money when they earn extra. For every £1 they earn over a small allowance, their benefit drops by 65p – higher than the 55p drop for people in private rentals. This makes jobs less attractive and could keep them stuck. The government could raise the allowance and cut the taper to level the playing field."
