title: "NHS private ADHD care left a young man untreated"
summary: "Ryan, a bright 23‑year‑old, died by suicide after months of confusion over his ADHD diagnosis. He used the NHS “right‑to‑choose” scheme to see a private clinic, but the clinic and his GP failed to link up, leaving him without medication or support. Doctors say the scheme is poorly regulated, with uneven standards and bad communication. Experts urge stricter rules and better teamwork to protect patients."
