title: "Warner Bros to Reject Paramount’s $108bn Takeover Offer"
summary: "Warner Bros Discovery’s board is expected to tell shareholders to turn down Paramount’s $108 billion hostile bid. Netflix already won the auction for the studio, offering cash and shares for assets like Harry Potter and HBO. Paramount’s all‑cash proposal is seen as less attractive, and its funding comes mainly from foreign sovereign funds, raising regulatory worries. A key investor, Affinity Partners, has pulled its support, leaving Paramount’s offer in doubt."
