title: "Dad’s Studio Holds a Rare Rembrandt Print"
summary: "After my parents died, I inherited their home. While sorting their studio, I found a dusty print. It turned out to be a preparatory work by Rembrandt, the Dutch master. A museum expert confirmed it was made by Rembrandt himself, not just a copy. The print could fetch £10,000‑£20,000 at auction. I’ll share the money with my sister and plan to buy a modern painting, remembering how this discovery brought my dad back to me."
