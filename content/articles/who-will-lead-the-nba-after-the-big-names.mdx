title: "Who Will Lead the NBA After the Big Names?"
summary: "The NBA’s top players—LeBron, Curry, Durant, and others—are getting older. The next generation of stars is coming from Europe and Canada, not just the U.S. Big names like Jokić, Giannis, and Luka Dončić are already stepping into leadership roles. A new American rookie, Cooper Flagg, shows promise by playing both offense and defense well. As the old guard fades, the league is shifting toward a more global, versatile set of leaders."
