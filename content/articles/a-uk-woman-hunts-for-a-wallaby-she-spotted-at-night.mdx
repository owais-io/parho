title: "A UK Woman Hunts for a Wallaby She Spotted at Night"
summary: "Late November, Molly Laird saw a hopping animal on a country road and filmed it, thinking it was a kangaroo. Friends and experts checked the video and said it was a red‑necked wallaby, a non‑native marsupial that can escape from zoos or farms. Researchers explained wallabies live in the UK’s mild climate, but their impact is still unclear. A farmer had one in his yard; the escaped wallaby was found and returned to its pen."
