title: "UK changes special‑needs education: parents hopeful but still worried"
summary: "UK ministers have announced reforms to special‑needs education, aiming to improve inclusion in mainstream schools and reduce the number of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs). Parents like Becky and May say the changes feel less disruptive and offer hope, but worry that kids with complex needs will still struggle. From 2030, many EHCPs will become new Individual Support Plans, limiting school choice and appeal options. Experts fear the plan lacks clear evidence and enough money."
