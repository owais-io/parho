title: "World Cup will use realistic player avatars to improve offside calls"
summary: "FIFA is giving every World Cup player a digital 3‑D copy of themselves. The copies, made from a quick scan, will be used by VAR to spot offside positions more accurately. The system can track each player’s exact height and shape, so taller or shorter players won’t be judged unfairly. The new tech will also speed up decisions and will be shared with all teams through a new data platform."
