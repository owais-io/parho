title: "Flu Cases Spike in December – Get Vaccinated Now"
summary: "Flu cases in the U.S. jumped sharply in December, after last year’s worst flu season since 2018. More than 3,100 people died from the virus last year, with 279 child deaths. The CDC reports about 7.5 million cases and 81,000 hospitalizations by mid‑December, a 25% rise over the previous week. A new flu strain, subclade K, is circulating. Fewer people are getting vaccines this year, so doctors urge anyone who hasn’t had a shot yet to do so, especially kids and seniors. They also suggest buying an at‑home test and getting treatment quickly if you test positive."
