title: "Trump's EPA Cancels Climate‑Risk Rule, Helping Big Polluters"
summary: "Trump’s EPA has scrapped a key rule that said greenhouse gases endanger health. That means the agency can’t set limits on cars, trucks or power plants. The move is seen as a win for oil and gas companies and a loss for the environment. California’s governor and many green groups warn the rollback will bring more heat waves, wildfires and higher health costs. The EPA says it will save money, but scientists warn it will add pollution and future expenses."
