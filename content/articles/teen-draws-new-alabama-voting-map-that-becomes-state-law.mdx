title: "Teen draws new Alabama voting map that becomes state law"
summary: "An 18‑year‑old from Alabama, Daniel DiDonato, drew a new state senate map that a federal judge picked over a special master’s plan. The judge had to fix a Voting Rights Act violation that weakened Black voters near Montgomery. DiDonato used free mapping software, changed just two districts, and met the court’s “minimal changes” rule. His map was adopted as state law, showing how tech lets anyone help shape elections."
