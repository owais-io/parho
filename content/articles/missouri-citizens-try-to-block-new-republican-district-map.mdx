title: "Missouri citizens try to block new Republican district map"
summary: "A Missouri resident, Jill Imbler, is leading a grassroots drive to stop a new congressional map made by Republicans after Trump pushed for redrawing districts. Missouri law lets citizens block laws with enough signatures. Imbler and volunteers have already gathered 200,000 signatures and aim for 106,000 by December. If they succeed, the map will be paused until voters decide in a 2026 referendum. The effort is part of a national fight over redistricting."
