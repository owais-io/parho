title: "Fiji’s HIV Epidemic Threatens Babies and Children"
summary: "Fiji is experiencing a rapid rise in HIV cases, especially among young people and drug users. The virus is spreading through shared needles and unprotected sex, and many families are unaware that HIV can be passed from mother to baby. Stigma and limited medical access make it hard for people to get tested or treated. Some hope is growing with new treatment programs and community support, but the crisis still endangers many children."
