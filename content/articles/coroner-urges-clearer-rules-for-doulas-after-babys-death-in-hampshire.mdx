title: "Coroner urges clearer rules for doulas after baby's death in Hampshire"
summary: "A coroner in Hampshire said more rules are needed for home‑birth assistants after a baby girl died from a brain injury. The inquest found the baby’s mother was kept at home too long while a doula, not a medical staff member, encouraged her to stay despite signs of distress. The report urges the NHS and health regulators to set clearer guidelines, so doulas and midwives can work safely together."
