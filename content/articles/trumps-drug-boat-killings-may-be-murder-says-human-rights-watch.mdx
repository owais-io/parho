title: "Trump’s drug boat killings may be murder, says Human Rights Watch"
summary: "Trump ordered the US military to shoot suspected drug smugglers off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. A November report exposed a double‑tap strike that killed two survivors who posed no threat. Congress, led by Democrats, is now demanding an investigation. Human Rights Watch argues that because the US isn’t at war with drug cartels, these killings amount to murder, not lawful combat. The case could set a dangerous precedent."
