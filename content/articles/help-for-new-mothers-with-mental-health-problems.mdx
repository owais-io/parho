title: "Help for New Mothers with Mental Health Problems"
summary: "Many new mothers in the UK are silently suffering from post‑birth depression. Research shows that 7 out of 10 feel overwhelmed, and last year up to 85,000 mums experienced postnatal depression. Untreated, this can lead to suicide, the biggest cause of death for women 6 weeks to a year after birth. It also harms babies, raising the risk of premature birth and attachment problems. Support, professional help and helplines can save lives."
