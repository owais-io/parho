title: "WPP drops out of the FTSE 100 after 30 years"
summary: "WPP, once the world’s biggest ad group, was removed from the FTSE 100 after almost 30 years. Its value fell from about £24 bn in 2017 to just £3.1 bn, and shares dropped two‑thirds this year. The drop comes as clients leave and rivals get ahead with AI and data tools. New CEO Cindy Rose says the company needs to act faster, and some say it could split up or be sold."
