title: "Manchester City’s poor second halves hurt their title bid"
summary: "Manchester City have been losing points in the second half of games, which is hurting their chances to win the Premier League title. While Arsenal have only dropped a few points, City have dropped more than anyone else in the top half of the table. The problems come from fatigue caused by a packed schedule and a new, high‑pressing style from new coach Pep Lijnders. If City could keep their form in the second half, they would lead the race."
