title: "Melting Under Antarctica’s Ice Could Raise Sea Levels"
summary: "Scientists studied melting under Antarctica’s ice shelves, finding they lose about 843 billion tonnes of ice each year from warm ocean water. This could raise global sea levels by several metres if the shelves become unstable and let the huge ice sheet rush into the sea. Researchers used models and float devices to track the cold, hidden water below the ice, but data are sparse. The exact speed of the loss remains uncertain, which could mean big impacts on coastlines."
