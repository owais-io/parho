summary: "Since 2024, the UK government has spent more than half a million pounds on 215 social media influencers to push its messages about the environment, welfare, and other topics. The Department for Education alone spent £350,000 and used 53 influencers this year. Other ministries, like the Home Office and the Department for Work and Pensions, also hired influencers to reach younger audiences and replace traditional press briefings.
