title: "Elon Musk’s new encyclopedia spreads white‑nationalist ideas and racist pseudo‑science"
summary: "Elon Musk launched an online encyclopedia called Grokipedia, saying it would clean up Wikipedia’s fake news. A Guardian investigation shows it is actually filled with entries that praise white supremacists, deny the Holocaust and spread racist concepts. The site presents these figures positively, tries to justify racism with “scientific” arguments, even supports eugenics, and experts warn it is a tool for spreading hate."
