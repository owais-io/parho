title: "Canada’s Population Falls as the Government Cuts International Student Visas"
summary: "Canada’s population slipped by 0.2 % in the third quarter, its first quarterly decline since 2020, largely because Ottawa tightened the number of study permits it gives out. The move is part of a plan to cut the share of non‑permanent residents to 5 % by 2027, halving new student visas and slowly boosting permanent‑resident intake. Analysts say the drop may ease housing costs and slow inflation, but it also means fewer people to drive growth."
