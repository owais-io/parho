title: "UK driving test wait times won’t reach seven weeks until 2027"
summary: "An audit found that the UK won’t cut driving test waiting time to seven weeks until November 2027. Only 83 new examiners have been hired, while 1.1 million slots are still unfilled. On average, people wait 22 weeks for a test, and many centres are booked out 24 weeks in advance. Bots and resellers drive up costs. The government will add military examiners and limit slot swaps, but progress will be slow."
