title: "Australia’s Labor Must Act Now to Re‑introduce Carbon Pricing"
summary: "Australia’s Labor party faces a decision on carbon pricing. While coal use in China and India fell last year and renewables grew, the U.S. saw coal rise under Trump. Clean energy now powers about half of electricity. Australia’s grid is shifting to solar, yet fossil‑fuel exports stay high. Experts say a carbon tax or trading scheme would be the cheapest way to cut emissions, but politicians fear cost backlash. The next year will decide if the government pushes polluters harder."
