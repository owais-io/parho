title: "Labour promises to rebuild North England railways – will the plan work?"
summary: "Labour’s chancellor has announced a £45bn plan to revive the stalled Northern Powerhouse Rail and other north‑west connections. The money is meant to build new lines, stations, and modern trains, but only a small portion is funded now and much work will start in the 2030s. Many locals and MPs hope the upgrade will close the gap with London’s transport, but critics fear the project will be delayed or abandoned again."
