title: "UK to spend £4bn on special education for children with SEND"
summary: "Britain’s government is launching a £4 billion plan to change how schools help children with special educational needs (SEND). The plan gives extra money for specialist teachers, speech‑language therapists and 60,000 new special school places, and pushes schools to include more children in mainstream classes. It also tightens rules for getting legal support plans (EHCPs). The move aims to improve support, cut the “postcode lottery” and keep local councils in check."
