title: "Amazon says my phone is lost and wants me to return it"
summary: "I bought a £544 phone from Amazon, but the tracker said it might be lost. I asked for a refund, and Amazon made me wait and asked for an incident report from my account email, which was rejected. They marked my order as a return I never made and have already taken two instalments. After a week, they finally refunded me and offered a £50 voucher. Anyone in a similar situation can try a chargeback."
