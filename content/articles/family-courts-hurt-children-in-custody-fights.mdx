title: "Family courts hurt children in custody fights"
summary: "In the UK, the way courts decide who gets to look after kids after a split can make things worse for families. The current system treats parents like opponents, making them fight over who gets the kids. Experts say we should instead start with a rule that both parents share time unless there’s violence, which would keep children closer to both parents and lower conflict. But the laws haven’t changed yet because of political resistance."
