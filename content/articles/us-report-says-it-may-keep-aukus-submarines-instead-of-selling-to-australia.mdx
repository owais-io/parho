title: "US Report Says It May Keep Aukus Submarines Instead of Selling to Australia"
summary: "A new U.S. congressional report says Washington might stop selling the Virginia‑class nuclear submarines promised to Australia under the Aukus deal. It argues keeping the boats under U.S. command would let the U.S. use them in a potential China‑Taiwan conflict, while Australia has said it would not guarantee support. The paper also points to shipyard limits, cyber‑security worries and Australia’s nuclear‑non‑proliferation rules. The report ultimately recommends sticking with the current plan to strengthen deterrence."
