title: "Cloudflare Outage Takes Down Major Websites Like LinkedIn and Zoom"
summary: "Cloudflare's network glitch knocked out many popular sites, including LinkedIn, X, Zoom and Canva, for a few minutes. The problem happened after a security fix changed how Cloudflare’s firewall handled requests, not a cyber attack. Experts say the outage shows how risky it is to rely on just a few global providers. Businesses should use multi‑region setups and be ready to switch quickly if a single provider goes down."
