title: "Iceland Hits Record 19.8 °C on Christmas Eve"
summary: "Iceland saw its warmest Christmas Eve ever, with temperatures climbing to 19.8 °C in the east town of Seyðisfjörður. That beats the previous 19.7 °C record set in 2019. Weather officials say a big high‑pressure system brought hot, tropical air across the country and kept colder air out. The record is part of a bigger trend of rising temperatures, heatwaves in May, new mosquitoes appearing, glaciers shrinking, and even warm‑water fish arriving."
