title: "Physics Helped Me Recover From Burnout"
summary: "I studied physics and thought hard work always paid off. But after losing my first job during the dot‑com crash, I hit burnout and felt the universe had betrayed me. Using ideas like chaotic systems, the three‑body problem, and phase‑change heat, I realized tiny stresses can explode into crisis. In the UK most adults face high stress yet work at 100 % with no spare capacity. Building “surge” time in our days is key to resilience."
