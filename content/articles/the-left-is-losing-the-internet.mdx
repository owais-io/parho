title: "The Left Is Losing the Internet"
summary: "Left politics has been hit hard by changes to social media. Algorithms now push emotional, polarising content, which right‑wing groups use to spread hate and conspiracy ideas. The left still relies on old media and small online outlets, but they’re split and lack a big, united platform. Meanwhile, right‑wing sites have built a clear, easy‑to‑follow world of memes and rallies. This has made it harder for left voices to get noticed."
