title: "Hotel Beds Should Not Have Decorative Cushions"
summary: "She says hotel rooms look tidy but the decorative cushions and throws on beds feel dirty. The author argues they collect dust and are rarely washed, making them unhygienic. Removing them is hard and they often come back the next day, forcing her to repeat the cleanup. She thinks the décor is pointless and harmful, and urges hotels to stop using them so guests can feel truly clean."
