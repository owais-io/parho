title: "England’s bowlers miss a big chance in Australia Test"
summary: "England's bowlers had a bad day, missing the right spots and letting Australia score runs quickly. Jofra Archer's first balls went off the bat or in the wrong directions, and the rest of the bowling attack kept bowling too wide or too short. Australia took advantage, making many runs and putting pressure on England's batsmen. The England team looked frustrated and needed time to regroup, but the damage was done."
