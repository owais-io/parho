title: "How Magpies Build Their Nest: Watching Persistence in Action"
summary: "I spent two weeks watching a pair of magpies build a nest in a Norway maple. They start in winter and keep adding thick hazel sticks, even hammering them into place with their bills and dropping some over the edge. The author notes their persistence over finesse and mentions another pair making a protective cover on an alder tree. Nearby, other birds like long‑tailed tits are building smaller moss domes, showing a busy spring for the woodland."
