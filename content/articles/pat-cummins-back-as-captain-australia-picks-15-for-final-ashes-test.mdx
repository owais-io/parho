title: "Pat Cummins Back as Captain, Australia Picks 15 for Final Ashes Test"
summary: "Pat Cummins is returning as Australia’s captain for the last Ashes Test in Adelaide. Usman Khawaja, who missed the second match with a back injury, is now in the squad, but his chances as an opener are slim because Travis Head and Jake Weatherald are batting at the top. The team still has some uncertainty over middle‑order spots and bowling options, especially with potential injuries to other players. Australia aims to finish the series strong and keep the Ashes title."
