title: "Stakeknife Report Brings Relief to Families of IRA Victims"
summary: "Police released Operation Kenova, a 160‑page report that confirms Freddie Scappaticci, the MI5 agent called Stakeknife, ran a squad that killed suspected IRA informers. The news has brought relief to families who had lived with shame and fear, because their loved ones were branded traitors. The report gave them answers and helped them stand up, but some say it still falls short, not naming the agent or fully explaining how he was allowed to act."
