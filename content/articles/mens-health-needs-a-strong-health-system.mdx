title: "Men’s Health Needs a Strong Health System"
summary: "The new Men’s Health Strategy in England aims to tackle men’s problems, from higher suicide rates to prostate cancer. It gives £300 m for community projects and plans campaigns to get men walking, running, and using peer‑support groups. But the plan will only help if the NHS gets more funding for the hardest‑hit areas and can clear the huge waiting lists that already affect everyone. Without that, the strategy may not make a real difference."
