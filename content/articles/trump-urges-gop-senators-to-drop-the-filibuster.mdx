title: "Trump urges GOP senators to drop the filibuster"
summary: "Donald Trump has asked Republican senators to end the filibuster, a rule that lets a minority block bills. He says removing it would stop government shutdowns and let the GOP push its agenda before the 2026 election. Republicans hold a 53‑47 majority, so dropping the rule could make it easier to pass legislation. Trump wants this change to help lower prices and boost the economy."
