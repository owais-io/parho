title: "Cookie Game: Three Friends Split Ten Cookies"
summary: "Three friends—Andy, Bea, and Celine—take turns grabbing any number of cookies from a jar of ten. They don't want to finish with the most or the least cookies, but they want as many as possible. Thinking ahead, Andy first takes four cookies so nobody ends up on the extremes. Bea then takes the remaining six, leaving Celine with none. That split satisfies both rules."
