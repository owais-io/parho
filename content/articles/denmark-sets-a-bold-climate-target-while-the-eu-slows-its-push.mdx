title: "Denmark sets a bold climate target while the EU slows its push"
summary: "Denmark has set a record‑breaking climate goal, pledging to cut greenhouse‑gas emissions by 82 % from 1990 levels by 2035. That’s higher than the UK’s 81 % target and ahead of the EU’s 66‑72 % range. Meanwhile, European leaders have been loosening green rules, easing a corporate‑sustainability law and allowing use of foreign carbon credits. The EU still plans a 90 % cut by 2040, but its approach is less ambitious than Denmark’s."
