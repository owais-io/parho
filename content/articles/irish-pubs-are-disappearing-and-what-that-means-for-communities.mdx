title: "Irish pubs are disappearing and what that means for communities"
summary: "Since 2005, Ireland has lost over 2,100 pubs—about 112 each year—leaving many rural towns without a local meeting spot. Reasons include high alcohol taxes, strict drink‑driving laws, rising rents, and lower drinking habits. New housing plans often skip pubs, which could hurt social cohesion and increase loneliness. Researchers say pubs keep people of all backgrounds together, offering a safe place to share feelings and simple conversations. Losing them would strip communities of an essential social hub."
