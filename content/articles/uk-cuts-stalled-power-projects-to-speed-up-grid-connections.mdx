title: "UK Cuts Stalled Power Projects to Speed Up Grid Connections"
summary: "The UK’s energy system operator, Neso, is clearing a huge backlog of stalled “zombie” power projects to fast‑track new clean energy. About 50% of the 700 GW of projects in the queue will be dropped, leaving around £40 bn of ready‑to‑build solar, battery and wind schemes. New projects will be split between fast‑track connections by 2030 and others by 2035, with only 3% gas. This move should help the country hit its zero‑carbon goal."
