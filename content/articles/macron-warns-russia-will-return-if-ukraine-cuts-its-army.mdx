summary: "At a G20 summit, French President Emmanuel Macron said Russia would “betray” its promises and come back if Ukraine were forced to reduce its forces, as Donald Trump’s peace plan proposes. He and other European leaders pushed back against the one‑sided plan, which would give up territory, limit Ukraine’s army and deny NATO membership. Ukraine’s officials say they’re ready to negotiate, but stress that any deal must guarantee security and keep borders unchanged."
