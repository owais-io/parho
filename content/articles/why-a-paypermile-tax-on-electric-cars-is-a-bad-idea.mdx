title: "Why a pay‑per‑mile tax on electric cars is a bad idea"
summary: "The article argues that charging electric cars a tax based on how many miles they drive is a bad plan. It says the rules would be confusing, cost more to run, and unfair to hybrids. Instead, it suggests scrapping the old road tax for a toll system that uses cameras or tiny chips in cars to track travel. The tax should be based on car size, not a flat 3p per mile, and the existing electricity VAT already acts as a fuel tax."
