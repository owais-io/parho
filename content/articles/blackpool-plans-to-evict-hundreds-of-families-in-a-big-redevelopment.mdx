title: "Blackpool plans to evict hundreds of families in a big redevelopment"
summary: "Blackpool council plans to tear down about 400 homes this summer and replace them with 230 new houses, a move that will force around 300 families to leave. The plan, funded by £90m from the government, is meant to create safer, energy‑efficient homes, but critics say it will worsen the town’s housing shortage and displace some of the most vulnerable residents. Residents and MPs have warned that the demolition could leave many without affordable housing."
