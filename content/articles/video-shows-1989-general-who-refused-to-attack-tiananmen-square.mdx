summary: "A six‑hour video of a 1989 court‑martial has surfaced, showing General Xu Qinxian refuse orders to lead 15,000 troops into Tiananmen Square. He said he didn’t want to become “a sinner in history” and argued the protest should be handled politically. The footage confirms a long‑held story about dissent inside the army.
