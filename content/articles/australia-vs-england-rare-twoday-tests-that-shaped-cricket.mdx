title: "Australia vs England: Rare Two‑Day Tests That Shaped Cricket"
summary: "Two‑day Test matches are very rare—only about 1 % of all Tests finish in just two days. Most early games happened when pitches were poor or the opposition was weak. A famous 1882 game in Melbourne sparked the Ashes, and in 1921 a fast‑bowling pair changed how England bowled. Modern two‑day Tests still occur, usually on very hard or bad pitches."
