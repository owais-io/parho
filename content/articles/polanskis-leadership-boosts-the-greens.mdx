title: "Polanski’s Leadership Boosts the Greens"
summary: "Polanski’s leadership has helped the Greens gain poll support, rising about four points since he took charge. Their latest average is around 13.5%, five points behind Labour. Young voters, especially 18‑24‑year‑olds, are driving this jump. Main concerns are cost of living, NHS, and the economy. While the party’s favorability is low, they could win several urban seats in the next election, especially where Labour is slipping."
