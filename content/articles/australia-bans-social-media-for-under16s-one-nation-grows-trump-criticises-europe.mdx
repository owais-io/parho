title: "Australia Bans Social Media for Under‑16s, One Nation Grows, Trump Criticises Europe"
summary: "Australia’s new law now stops Facebook, Instagram, X and YouTube from letting anyone under 16 access the platforms, a move that could cost the sites up to $50 million in fines if they don’t comply. The change, led by eSafety chief Julia Inman‑Grant, has drawn praise from some and criticism from others, including Elon Musk and far‑right groups. A recent poll shows the right‑wing One Nation party now has 17 % support, a record high. Meanwhile, former U.S. President Donald Trump called Europe “decaying” and said he might cut support for Ukraine."
