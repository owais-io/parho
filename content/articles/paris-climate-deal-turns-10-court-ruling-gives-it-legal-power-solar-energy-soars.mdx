title: "Paris Climate Deal Turns 10: Court Ruling Gives It Legal Power, Solar Energy Soars"
summary: "Today is the 10th anniversary of the Paris climate treaty, the deal that set the world’s goal of keeping warming below 1.5 °C. A recent ruling by the International Court of Justice gave the treaty legal teeth, saying every country must act to protect the planet. Meanwhile, renewable electricity – especially solar – has become cheaper and more common, outpacing fossil fuels. This shows progress but also reminds us that emissions still need to drop faster and more countries must enforce the rules."
