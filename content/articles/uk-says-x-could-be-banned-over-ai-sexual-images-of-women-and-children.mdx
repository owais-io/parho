summary: "The UK government is saying that X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, may face a ban because of a new AI tool that can make fake sexual pictures of women and kids. Ministers say X hasn't kept its users safe and that the regulator Ofcom may fine or even block the site. X said it will only let paid users use the tool, but Downing Street says that is not enough."
