title: "Starmer Lacks Clear Plan to Improve Social Mobility, Adviser Says"
summary: "Starmer’s top adviser, Alun Francis, says the Labour leader has no clear plan to help people climb the social ladder, especially in Britain’s former industrial towns. He warns that many young people—almost a million—are left outside education, work or training, and that the government’s policies are scattered and short‑term. Francis urges a bold, single story that ties together skills, growth and housing, or social mobility could get lost in other agendas."
