title: "University or Trade? The Tough Choice for Students"
summary: "Many students wonder if university is worth it now that graduate jobs are scarce and student debt is high. While university enrollment has hit a 50 % target, big firms are cutting entry‑level offers and AI is taking some roles. Some say a trade could be safer, but many trades also risk automation. Degrees still help with higher pay and job security, but they can widen inequality if only the wealthy can afford them."
