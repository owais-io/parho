title: "Airbus Fixes Software Glitch but Finds New Panel Problem, Shares Fall"
summary: "Airbus has fixed most of a software glitch that had grounded thousands of its A320 jets, but a new problem with metal panels on some planes was found. The company ordered repairs for about 6,000 aircraft, and airlines cancelled flights over Thanksgiving. Only a few dozen planes still need the software update, and some older ones may need a hardware change. The panel issue caused Airbus shares to drop about 6%, even though the company remains up 20% this year."
