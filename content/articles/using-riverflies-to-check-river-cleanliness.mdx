summary: "Scientists kneel beside the River Forth in Belfast to collect tiny riverfly larvae that live only in clean water. They scoop the riverbed with a net and hand‑search, then count and identify the species. The mix and number of these insects give the Environment Agency a clear score of the river’s health. It shows how everyday people can help monitor water quality."
