title: "Hope for Scotland’s Rare Capercaillie Bird"
summary: "After decades of decline, the rare capercaillie in Scotland’s Highlands is showing hope. At RSPB Abernethy, male counts rose 50 % from 20 in 2020 to 30 in 2025, part of a national effort. Conservationists use remote mowers to clear heather, plant blaeberry, and manage cattle grazing to protect nesting sites. These actions help chicks survive and keep the bird’s future bright."
