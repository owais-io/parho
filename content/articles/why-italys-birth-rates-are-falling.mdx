title: "Why Italy’s Birth Rates are Falling"
summary: "Italy’s birth rate has dropped because fewer people are starting families, not because men can’t produce sperm. A 2024 Pew survey of people over 50 who never had children found that 31% didn’t want children, 39% said it never happened, and 33% couldn’t find a partner. Since 1980 Italy’s maternity rate fell from 77% to 60%, causing most of the country’s fertility decline. Henan in China may affect sperm, but that isn’t the main reason for Italy’s demographic winter."
