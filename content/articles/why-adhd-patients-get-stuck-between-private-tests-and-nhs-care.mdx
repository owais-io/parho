title: "Why ADHD Patients Get Stuck Between Private Tests and NHS Care"
summary: "UK doctors and parents are caught between private ADHD tests and NHS services, causing long waits and wasted money. The NHS spends about £164 million each year on ADHD, yet private assessments often get rejected for not following NICE guidelines. Patients then face delays, with waiting times up to years, especially in Greater Manchester where referrals have quadrupled. The government is testing a new triage system to cut unnecessary tests and help people sooner."
