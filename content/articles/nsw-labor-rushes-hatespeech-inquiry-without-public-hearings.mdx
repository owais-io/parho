title: "NSW Labor Rushes Hate‑Speech Inquiry Without Public Hearings"
summary: "NSW Labor has hurried a hate‑speech inquiry that will ban phrases like “globalise the intifada” after the Bondi shooting. The committee has only three weeks to get submissions and will not hold public hearings, a move critics say cuts out community voices. Labor says the rush is urgent and will report by the end of January. Jewish groups welcome the effort, while pro‑Palestine activists warn it may backfire."
