title: "Waymo’s Robot Cars Could Be Safer Than Human Drivers"
summary: "The Super Bowl weekend is a test for Waymo’s robot taxis, which are getting a big cash boost to spread worldwide. I’ve taken a few rides and found them quiet and safe, but I still worry about jobs and data privacy. The article compares robot cars with regular taxis that are regulated, unionized, and have fewer safety risks. It questions whether we should keep human drivers instead of fully adopting driverless tech."
