summary: "Healthwatch says people with sudden tooth pain in England are being denied NHS urgent appointments. Some have to drive over 100 miles, pay for private care or even travel abroad. Others resort to pulling teeth or taking unprescribed antibiotics. NHS 111 calls about dental problems have jumped 20%. The government plans 700,000 extra urgent slots and dental contract changes, but the problem is still big and patients' pain continues."
