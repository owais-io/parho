title: "After Eating 3,000 Meals, I Made My Own List of London’s Best Restaurants"
summary: "The article explains how the author, Jonathan Nunn, spent years eating about 3,000 meals across London to pick 99 restaurants for his own list. He talks about how restaurant lists, like Michelin or The World’s 50 Best, have become a huge trend but often lack real meaning. Nunn argues that “best” is personal and can’t be judged by a single standard, and that true lists spark our own opinions rather than give a final verdict."
