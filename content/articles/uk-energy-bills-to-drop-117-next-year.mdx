title: "UK Energy Bills to Drop £117 Next Year"
summary: "Last month, chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government will cut green‑subsidy charges from household bills. That move will lower the energy price cap from £1,758 to about £1,641 a year, giving households a saving of £117 next year. The cut still leaves bills roughly £425 higher than before the Ukraine crisis, because gas import and network‑upgrade costs stay high. Experts say the savings are good, but keeping them will need ongoing investment and clear communication."
