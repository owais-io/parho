title: "Short UK paternity leave blamed for rising family breakups"
summary: "A new survey says more than one‑third of separated parents think the UK’s two‑week paternity leave made their relationships harder to keep together. The leave pays just £187 a week, less than half the minimum wage, and many dads can’t afford to take it. Campaign groups say the short break keeps fathers from sharing childcare, which hurts gender equality and increases divorces. MPs want to extend the leave to six weeks and include self‑employed workers next year."
