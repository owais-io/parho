title: "UK Departments Clash Over Cuts to School Physical Education Funding"
summary: "UK departments have clashed after the Health Ministry said it would cut its £60 m contribution to school physical education. The Education Ministry is also planning a £60 m cut, threatening the minimum two‑hour a week that the government wants to guarantee. The move could reduce PE time for millions of children, who are already facing high obesity rates. Ministers will meet to resolve the row before new rules roll out."
