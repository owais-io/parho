title: "A Wren Makes My Old Greenhouse Home"
summary: "The writer pushes open a frost‑tight greenhouse door and spots a mouse, then a wren that has been nesting there for weeks. The wren, a common but quiet bird, flies out through a broken pane when the door opens. It will stay in the greenhouse over winter, while the author cleans out dead leaves and plant labels. In spring, the wren will return to sing and the writer will sow sweet peas again."
