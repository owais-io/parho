title: "Venezuela Lets Private Oil Companies In After US Pressure"
summary: "Venezuela's acting president signed a new oil law that lets private companies manage and sell oil, while the state still controls production. The move comes after US pressure and a call from former President Trump who promised more investment. Analysts say the law is a step forward but still vague and unlikely to bring big capital until a democratic transition. Venezuela’s oil output has fallen sharply in recent years."
