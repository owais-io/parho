title: "Scientists Show How Snowman‑Shaped Kuiper Belt Rocks Formed"
summary: "Scientists used computer models to show that gentle collisions in the early solar system could make snowman‑shaped rocks like Arrokoth in the Kuiper belt. Simulations of tiny pebbles falling together produced double‑lobed “contact binaries” that match the space probe’s findings. The study confirms that many of these objects formed slowly, supporting the idea that the Kuiper belt is a relic of the Sun’s birth cloud."
