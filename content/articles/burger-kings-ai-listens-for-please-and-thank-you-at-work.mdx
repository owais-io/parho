title: "Burger King’s AI Listens for “Please” and “Thank You” at Work"
summary: "Burger King has launched an AI headset called “Patty” that listens to staff when they talk to customers. The system checks if they use polite words like “please,” “thank you,” and “welcome.” It is meant to give managers quick feedback on service quality, not to score employees. Other features include menu updates, ingredient info, and cleanliness alerts. The pilot is running in 500 US restaurants and will roll out to all locations by 2026."
