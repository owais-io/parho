title: "Energy Bills Will Drop £10 a Month From April"
summary: "From April, Britain's average energy bill will fall by about £10 a month because Ofgem lowered the price cap by 7%. The cut comes from the government scrapping or moving green levies, especially the energy company obligation scheme. The new cap means most households – even those on fixed contracts – will pay less. However, the drop isn’t the full £150 promised, and future revisions could push prices up again."
