summary: "Four Chagossians landed on Île du Coin, a remote island in the Chagos archipelago, to set up tents and claim the land as their home. They hope to stop the UK’s plan to hand the islands over to Mauritius in 2025, except for a 99‑year lease of Diego Garcia for a US‑UK military base. Mauritius says the move is a publicity stunt, while the UN warns the deal could keep past injustices alive."
