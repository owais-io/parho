title: "Sheffield Wednesday takeover stalled while league checks bidders’ gambling links"
summary: "The English Football League is slowing the sale of Sheffield Wednesday because the preferred buyers come from gambling and crypto‑betting backgrounds. The takeover group, led by poker pro James Bord and casino owner Felix Roemer, has paid a multimillion‑pound deposit and says it can fund the £30 million purchase and running costs, but the league and an independent regulator are reviewing their money sources and whether they meet owner‑and‑director rules."
