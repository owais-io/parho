title: "China’s cheap kimchi is pushing Korean makers out of the market"
summary: "Kimchi, Korea’s national food, is now being sold at much lower prices by Chinese factories. Local producers, who make their own kimchi in small workshops, are losing business because restaurants choose the cheaper imports. The rise of single‑person homes means less homemade kimchi and more ready‑made versions, so the market depends on bulk sales. Climate changes and high cabbage costs add pressure. The industry is trying vouchers and government help to keep Korean kimchi alive."
