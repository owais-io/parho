title: "EU imports of Russian LNG help fund Putin’s war"
summary: "EU's huge imports of Russian LNG keep the Kremlin wealthy while it fights Ukraine. Last year, Russia made about €7.2 bn from LNG sent to EU ports, mainly from the Yamal field in Siberia. Even though Brussels plans a 2027 ban, more than 15 million tonnes still flowed into Europe in 2025, with France taking the most. Shipping firms like Seapeak and Dynagas help move the gas, making the EU an essential part of the supply chain."
