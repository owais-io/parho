title: "Why are low‑alcohol drinks almost as pricey as regular ones in Australia?"
summary: "Non‑alcoholic beers, wines and spirits in Australia are almost as pricey as their regular‑strength cousins, even though they don’t pay the heavy alcohol excise. The reason is a mix of higher production costs for small brands, marketing tricks like price anchoring, and the fact that people who drink low‑alcohol drinks are less price‑sensitive. The market is growing fast, so manufacturers can set higher prices, but many still use soft drinks instead."
