title: "England’s Ashes loss shakes coach McCullum’s credibility, new coach needed"
summary: "England’s poor Ashes performance shows the team’s weak basics and a broken coaching structure. Critics say head coach Brendon McCullum and manager Rob Key failed to prepare the squad, keep players on track, and their captain Ben Stokes feels misaligned. The best performers—Root, Bethell, Stokes—did well, but not under McCullum’s plan. The piece argues the job is not fit and calls for a fresh, experienced coach, like Alec Stewart, to reset the team’s culture and plans."
