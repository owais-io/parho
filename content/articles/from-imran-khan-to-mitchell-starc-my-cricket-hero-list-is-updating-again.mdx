title: "From Imran Khan to Mitchell Starc: My Cricket Hero List Is Updating Again"
summary: "I grew up calling my cousins “Imran Khan” and later “Wasim Akram” because of the cricket legends I loved. Now, watching Mitchell Starc take his 415th Test wicket and become the highest‑wicket left‑arm bowler, I feel like my hero list is updating again. Starc’s record is even more impressive because it’s set in an era where batting dominates, so each wicket matters a lot. Cricket is still my bedtime story and my way to feel connected."
