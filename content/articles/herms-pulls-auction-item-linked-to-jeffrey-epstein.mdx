title: "Hermès pulls auction item linked to Jeffrey Epstein"
summary: "In 2016 Hermès withdrew a donated item from a charity auction after it turned out Jeffrey Epstein had bought it. New US justice files show French cultural leader Jack Lang and his daughter Caroline used Epstein’s money for private jets, cars and a company in the US Virgin Islands, and were named in tax‑fraud investigations. The documents highlight how French elites have relied on Epstein’s wealth for political and cultural influence, not just his sexual abuse."
