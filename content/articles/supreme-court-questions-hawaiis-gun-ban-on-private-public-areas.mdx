title: "Supreme Court Questions Hawaii’s Gun Ban on Private Public Areas"
summary: "Three Maui residents and a gun group are taking Hawaii’s new gun law to the U.S. Supreme Court. The law says people can’t bring guns onto private property that’s open to the public unless the owner says it’s OK. The Court is hearing whether that rule hurts the Second Amendment. Judges on the conservative‑leaning court seemed doubtful, while a liberal justice questioned the right to carry on private property."
