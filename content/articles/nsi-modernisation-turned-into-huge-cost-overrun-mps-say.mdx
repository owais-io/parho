title: "NS&I Modernisation Turned into Huge Cost Overrun, MPs Say"
summary: "The UK’s state‑owned savings bank, NS&I, has turned its £3 billion upgrade plan into a disaster. MPs find the project has cost far more than expected, with little progress. The plan originally aimed to cut costs and replace a long‑time IT partner, but now may need to keep the old contractor longer. The Treasury is still willing to fund more money, but the bank has not shown how it will finish the work."
