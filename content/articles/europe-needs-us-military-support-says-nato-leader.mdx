summary: "Mark Rutte, NATO’s secretary‑general, said Europe can’t defend itself without the U.S. He warned that building a European army would need double the money and years to get ready. Other leaders want a stronger European defence, but experts point out Europe still depends on U.S. systems like intelligence, missiles, and airlift. The debate shows Europe is still figuring out how to be truly independent."
