title: "Rubio’s Munich Speech Promises Friendship, but Only if Europe Shares White Christian Values"
summary: "At the Munich Security Conference, US Senator Marco Rubio gave a speech that initially calmed European leaders, who praised his more friendly tone. But his words still echoed Trump‑style right‑wing ideas: a focus on white, Christian heritage, anti‑immigration, and distrust of global institutions. He followed the speech with trips to Slovakia’s and Hungary’s leaders, who are pro‑Russian and anti‑EU. European officials stressed their commitment to democracy, climate goals, and free trade, showing they will not easily accept this rhetoric."
