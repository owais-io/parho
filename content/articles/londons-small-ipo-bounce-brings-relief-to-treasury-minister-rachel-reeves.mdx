title: "London’s small IPO bounce brings relief to Treasury minister Rachel Reeves"
summary: "London’s IPO market was weak in early 2025 because of U.S. tariffs, but it picked up in the second half. Still, listings are far below the 2021 peak. Big names like the data‑centre group Fermi, food‑maker Princes, and lender Shawbrook added capital. The LSE says more companies plan London debuts in 2026, such as software firm Visma. Treasury minister Rachel Reeves has promised a three‑year stamp‑duty break to encourage more listings."
