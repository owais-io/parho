title: "Trump Keeps War with Venezuela on the Table"
summary: "Trump says he may still go to war with Venezuela, and his aides back that stance. They are hitting oil tankers and drug‑related boats, and the U.S. Navy is blocking many sanctioned vessels to cut the Maduro government’s income. With 15,000 troops near the border, the U.S. is ready for a strike. Officials say they’re pressing Maduro because his regime is intolerable, but some critics see it as a push for regime change."
