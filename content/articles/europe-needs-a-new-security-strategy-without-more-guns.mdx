title: "Europe Needs a New Security Strategy Without More Guns"
summary: "Europe faces pressure from Trump, Putin, and a growing split in NATO. Some think a new, EU‑led defense could work, but that might create more danger. Others suggest Europe adopt a neutral, human‑security model like Switzerland, Ireland, or Austria. They argue for transparent, civilian‑led deterrence and solidarity, not more weapons or nuclear threats. The debate is about choosing long‑term safety over short‑term military power."
