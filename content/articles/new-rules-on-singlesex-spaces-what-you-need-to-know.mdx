title: "New Rules on Single‑Sex Spaces: What You Need to Know"
summary: "The UK’s Equality Commission is waiting to publish new rules that say single‑sex bathrooms, locker rooms and other private spaces should only be used by people whose sex at birth matches the space’s label. That means transgender people might not be able to use a bathroom that matches their gender identity. The EHRC chair urges businesses to keep good signs and offer alternatives. Some activists worry the guidance could bar trans people from public life."
