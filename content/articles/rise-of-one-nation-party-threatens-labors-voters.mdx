title: "Rise of One Nation Party Threatens Labor’s Voters"
summary: "A recent poll shows one‑fifth of Australians who usually back Labor could vote for One Nation, the right‑wing party led by Pauline Hanson. The spike is partly because many are unhappy with the government’s handling of costs, jobs and housing. Labor is trying to win back voters by stressing everyday policies and jobs, while warning that One Nation’s anti‑immigration stance and lack of policy will hurt its credibility."
