title: "Europe Feels Trump Is a Threat – Will Leaders Stand Up?"
summary: "Almost half of Europeans think Donald Trump is an enemy. A new U.S. security plan says the EU is a target and could help far‑right groups that want less immigration. It also claims the U.S. will try to boost these groups to power. European leaders have been quiet, but experts say they must act now, support Ukraine, and build an independent security plan to stop Trump’s influence. Europe could turn the tables if it steps up."
