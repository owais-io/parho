title: "MAGA Fans Outrage Over Pink Men’s Sweater"
summary: "A pink wool sweater from J Crew has sparked a frenzy among some MAGA‑leaning Americans. Social‑media posts say men shouldn’t wear pink, calling it unmanly or even “gay.” Politicians and followers posted jokes and even photoshopped a politician onto the sweater. While pink is common in fashion and worn by many men, the backlash shows how the color can become a flashpoint in debates about masculinity and identity, even though the sweater itself is ordinary."
