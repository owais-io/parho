title: "Lords blocking assisted‑dying law threatens democracy"
summary: "The House of Lords, an unelected chamber, is stopping a law on assisted dying that the elected Commons passed by a clear majority. MPs say the Lords’ delay breaks the rule that the Commons’ decisions win. They urge the Lords to let the law pass or, if it rejects it, the Commons’ choice must still prevail. Obstruction could set a bad precedent and push for major reforms of the Lords."

The House of Lords, an unelected chamber, is stopping a law on assisted dying that the elected Commons passed by a clear majority. MPs say the Lords’ delay breaks the rule that the Commons’ decisions win. They urge the Lords to let the law pass or, if it rejects it, the Commons’ choice must still prevail. Obstruction could set a bad precedent and push for major reforms of the Lords.
