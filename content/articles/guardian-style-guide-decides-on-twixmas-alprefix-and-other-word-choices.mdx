title: "Guardian Style Guide Decides on Twixmas, Al‑Prefix and Other Word Choices"
summary: "The Guardian’s style editors had to answer weird questions: should it be “Twixmas” or “Twixtmas”? Do we drop the “al‑” from Arabic names? Should space use kilometres or miles? They chose the common “Twixmas” and keep the “al‑” to avoid bias. They keep British English rules but allow some American terms, use metric for science, and aim for clear, fair language that reflects how people actually speak."
