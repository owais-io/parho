title: "UK Economy Might Fall 3.6% if Migration Stops"
summary: "A research group called NIESR says that if the UK stops taking in new migrants, the economy could shrink 3.6% by 2040. The country’s population would level off at about 70 million, and an ageing workforce would slow job growth. While wages might rise a bit, weaker output would cut tax revenue, forcing the government to borrow more. Without higher birth rates or new migrants, the plan is not financially sustainable."
