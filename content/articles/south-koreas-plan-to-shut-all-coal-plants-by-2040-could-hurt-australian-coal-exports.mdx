title: "South Korea’s plan to shut all coal plants by 2040 could hurt Australian coal exports"
summary: "South Korea, which imports a lot of Australian coal, announced it will shut all of its coal power plants by 2040. That could lead to a sharp drop in coal exports to the country and forces Australia to rethink its coal‑based economy. Experts warn that Australia’s fossil‑fuel revenue could fall by half in five years. They suggest shifting focus to green minerals and clean‑energy exports instead."
