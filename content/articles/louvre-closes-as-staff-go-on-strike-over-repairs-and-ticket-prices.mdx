title: "Louvre Closes as Staff Go on Strike Over Repairs and Ticket Prices"
summary: "The Louvre shut its doors after workers began a strike demanding better security, more staff and urgent building fixes. They also protested a 45% ticket price hike for non‑EU visitors, saying it unfairly penalises tourists from the UK, US and China. The action comes after a jewel robbery, a water leak, and concerns over safety in the museum’s ancient Greek room. Unions fear the strike could keep the museum closed for days during its busiest season."
