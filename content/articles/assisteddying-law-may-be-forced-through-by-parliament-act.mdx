title: "Assisted‑Dying Law May Be Forced Through by Parliament Act"
summary: "Assisted‑dying supporters plan to use the old 1911 Parliament Act to force the bill past a blocked Lords. If the Lords keep delaying it, the bill will fail unless the Commons uses this rarely‑used rule, which lets the lower house override the upper house. Backers see it as a last‑ditch move, while opponents say it’s a political stunt and that the bill needs more scrutiny. The move could spark a big political backlash."
