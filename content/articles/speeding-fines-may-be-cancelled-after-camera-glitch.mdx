title: "Speeding fines may be cancelled after camera glitch"
summary: "A software glitch caused some speed cameras in England to record drivers as speeding even after the speed limit had risen, leading to about 2,650 incorrect fines since 2021. National Highways says the problem affected only a tiny fraction of all camera checks. They’re fixing the bug and will reach out to anyone wrongly fined, refunding money and dropping any points. Police have paused issuing new variable‑camera fines until the issue is solved."
