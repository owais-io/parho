summary: "Ovo Energy tried to help homes stay warm during the 2022 crisis, but a silly suggestion like “do star jumps” offended many people and hurt the company’s reputation. Now the supplier is in trouble: it must cut about 200 jobs, raise hundreds of millions to meet new regulator rules, and investors are hesitant to put money in. The firm also pays large royalties to its founder’s company, adding to its financial strain."
