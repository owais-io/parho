title: "Abortion Losing Ground With Democrats Ahead of 2026 Elections"
summary: "Polls show fewer Democrats see abortion as a key voting issue—down from 55% in 2024 to 36% this October. Republicans still rate it high. While abortion was the Democrats’ top message in 2024, the 2026 midterms focus more on the economy, affordability, and the health of democracy. State ballot measures keep the debate alive, but funding for abortion‑rights groups is shrinking, making it harder to support those who need care."
