title: "The Beach’s Bran‑Stick Shells: Tiny Tubes Made by Sand‑Mason Worms"
summary: "Every time I walk on this beach, the sand shifts, leaving behind new treasures. One of the most striking are tiny, bran‑stick‑like shells. They’re actually tubes built by sand‑mason worms (Lanice conchilega) from bits of shell and rock. The worms use these tubes to stay safe, catch food, and survive the waves. Birds later scoop them up, making the beach a lively, ever‑changing ecosystem."
