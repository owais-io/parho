title: "Newsom fights California’s billionaire tax plan"
summary: "California Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting a proposed 5% one‑time tax on residents worth more than $1 billion. He says the measure would push billionaires like Sergey Brin and Larry Page out of the state and hurt tech jobs. The plan is backed by unions that say the money would fund health care and schools, but business groups and the billionaires themselves are campaigning against it. The measure still needs 900,000 signatures to reach voters."
