title: "New Pill Could Help Diabetes Patients Lose Up to 8% of Weight"
summary: "Scientists tested a new daily pill called orforglipron, which targets the same receptors as popular diabetes drugs. In a phase‑3 study, people with type 2 diabetes lost 6‑8% of their body weight—more than the 4‑5% seen with the current oral drug, semaglutide. The pill also lowered blood sugar, but more patients stopped it because of stomach and bowel side‑effects. The drug isn’t yet approved, and doctors say more safety data are needed."
