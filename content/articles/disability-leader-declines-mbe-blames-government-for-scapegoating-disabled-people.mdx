title: "Disability Leader Declines MBE, Blames Government for Scapegoating Disabled People"
summary: "Tressa Burke, head of Glasgow Disability Alliance, turned down an MBE that was offered to her for helping disabled people in Scotland. She said she would not accept the award because the UK government’s policies and the recent budget are harming disabled people, calling them “scapegoated” and “demonised”. Burke points out cuts to benefits and schemes, and fears that the honours system gives a bad message. She remains proud of her community’s support and wants real policy change."
