title: "UK Arrests of Peter Mandelson and Another in Epstein Investigation"
summary: "Two high‑profile men, former UK minister Peter Mandelson and another unnamed politician, were arrested in Britain as part of the ongoing probe into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes. The arrests were a small step for a case that has seen few charges, especially in the US, where no other alleged accomplices have been taken into custody. The column criticises the lack of action against other suspects and the slow pace of the investigation."
