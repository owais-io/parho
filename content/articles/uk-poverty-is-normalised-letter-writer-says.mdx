title: "UK Poverty Is Normalised, Letter Writer Says"
summary: "Letter writer Liam Purcell argues that UK austerity has turned poverty into everyday reality, with many communities losing shared spaces and support. He notes that few low‑income people have a say in policy, and that small‑scale local projects have helped but aren’t enough. Purcell calls for stronger social security and more involvement from those who use it. The letter highlights rising food‑bank use, recent benefits changes, and the need to rebuild national resilience."
