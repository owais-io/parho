title: "Lords Push for an Under‑16 Social Media Ban"
summary: "The House of Lords voted 261‑to‑150 to ban social media for people under 16. The move pressures Prime Minister Keir Starmer to act, but he says he will wait for more evidence, like Australia’s recent ban. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and many Labour MPs, parents and campaigners are urging a quick ban to protect children’s mental health and focus at school. The bill will now go to the Commons, where it may not pass."
