title: "Genes May Explain About Half of Why Some People Live Long"
summary: "Scientists have found that genetics might explain about half of why some people live long. By correcting earlier studies that mixed up death from accidents or disease with natural ageing, researchers used twin data and a new model. They discovered that around 50 % of lifespan variation is genetic, while the rest comes from lifestyle and environment. The finding could guide future treatments to slow ageing."
