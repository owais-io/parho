title: "Steam Fails to Stop Hate and Harassment"
summary: "Steam, the world’s biggest PC game shop, lets hateful comments and big‑raced reviews stay online. Developers say their titles, especially those with LGBTQ+ characters, get slammed by bad reviews and “curators” who push politics. Moderators often ignore or remove only a few posts, and Valve rarely responds. The result is harassment, hurt sales and a sense that developers must fight to keep their games safe."
