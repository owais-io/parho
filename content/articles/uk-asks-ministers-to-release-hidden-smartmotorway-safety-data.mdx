summary: "Campaigners and motoring groups want the UK government to publish safety reports on smart motorways that have been kept secret since 2022. These ‘pope’ reports show how the roads, where the hard shoulder is turned into a live lane, have performed in terms of accidents, deaths and economic gains. After a series of breakdowns, critics say the data may reveal problems. The Department for Transport says the reports will appear soon, but the AA and want the hard shoulder back."
