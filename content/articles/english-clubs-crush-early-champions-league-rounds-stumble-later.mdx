title: "English clubs crush early Champions League rounds, stumble later"
summary: "English Premier League clubs have a knack for crushing opponents in the Champions League group stage, thanks to big budgets and strong squads. But they often get tired before the knockout rounds. The heavy schedule, extra matches and lack of fresh rivals mean they can't match the energy of clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern or PSG in later stages. That’s why only three English teams have won the trophy in the last decade."
