summary: "In 2025, sports were full of cheating stories—from a 19‑year‑old Go player using AI, to controversial rule changes that let a Chinese player win by accident. Norway’s ski‑jumpers tampered with suits, pool players tried to wax balls, and stone‑skimming competitors doctored their stones. Even curling teams were caught manipulating stones, and rugby players faced bans for biting and eye‑gouging. The year was a nonstop list of sports scandals."
