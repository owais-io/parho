title: "Football clubs to vote on expanding playoffs to six teams"
summary: "Football clubs will vote next month on expanding the Championship playoffs to six teams. The plan adds a first‑round eliminator, letting the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th places compete before the usual semi‑finals. The Premier League worries about lower‑ranking teams moving up, but Sky Sports likes the extra drama. If passed, the format could later be used in lower leagues."
