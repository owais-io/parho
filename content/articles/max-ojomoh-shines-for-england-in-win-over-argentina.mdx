title: "Max Ojomoh Shines for England in Win Over Argentina"
summary: "England won every match in November without any new players, and Max Ojomoh made a big splash in his second appearance against Argentina. He scored a try, set up two others, and showed he can run, pass, and kick. The result has made coach Steve Borthwick rethink the centre pairings, and Ojomoh looks likely to stay in the side as England heads into the Six Nations and prepares for the World Cup."
