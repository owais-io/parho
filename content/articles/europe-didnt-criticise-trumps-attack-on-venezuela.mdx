title: "Europe Didn't Criticise Trump’s Attack on Venezuela"
summary: "European leaders were slow to condemn Trump’s illegal military intervention in Venezuela, instead calling for a negotiated, Venezuelan‑led solution. Trump said he was in charge and warned more force if Maduro’s regime didn’t obey Washington. Britain’s Keir Starmer, France’s Macron and others were quiet, partly to keep the U.S. as a partner for Ukraine. The article says Europe must speak out against U.S. unilateralism, build its own military strength and defend its values. It also notes Denmark’s warning over Trump’s claim to Greenland and calls for Europe to develop hard power to counter such moves."
