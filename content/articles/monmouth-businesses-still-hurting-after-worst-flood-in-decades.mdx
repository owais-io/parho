title: "Monmouth businesses still hurting after worst flood in decades"
summary: "Heavy rains hit Monmouth last month, sending the River Monnow to flood the town. Almost 200 homes and 120 shops were hit, and many small businesses lost equipment, food and customers. The owners say insurance didn’t cover the damage, and some shops have not reopened yet. The council offers small grants and rate cuts, but the cost of repairs is still huge. People worry that more flooding will come as the climate changes."
