title: "Philadelphia Sues U.S. Over Slavery Exhibit Removal"
summary: "Philadelphia filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Interior Department, saying the Trump administration removed a slavery‑related exhibit from Independence National Historical Park. The display, located at President House, had panels that honored enslaved people who lived and worked there. City lawyers argue the removal erases history and violates a 2006 agreement. Pennsylvania’s governor blasted the move as white‑washing, and the case seeks the exhibit’s return. The suit also cites a 2003 congressional push to formally recognize enslaved people at the site."
