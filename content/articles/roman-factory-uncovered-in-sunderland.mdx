summary: "Archaeologists in Sunderland found a huge Roman factory that made whetstones, the tools used to sharpen weapons. Over 800 broken stone bars were uncovered, plus many more hidden in the riverbank – the biggest collection in north‑west Europe. The Offerton site was a production and trading hub where stone was cut and shipped by river to the rest of Britain and beyond. This discovery shows Sunderland was part of the Roman industrial network and could reshape our view of Roman Britain."
