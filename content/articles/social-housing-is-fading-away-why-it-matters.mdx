title: "Social Housing Is Fading Away – Why It Matters"
summary: "After World Wars, the UK built council estates for working people. The government thought private landlords were bad, so it kept homes in public hands. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher sold many of them, and they often fell into bad condition. Today, very few social‑rent homes exist, and reports say low‑income people are being denied them. Shelters warn that homelessness is rising. The future may need a new, government‑run system managed by local communities."
