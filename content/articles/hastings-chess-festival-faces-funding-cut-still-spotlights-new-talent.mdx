title: "Hastings Chess Festival Faces Funding Cut, Still Spotlights New Talent"
summary: "The Hastings Chess Festival, a historic event that has run since 1895, missed many of the world’s top grandmasters this year because the local council stopped funding it. With only £10,000 in prizes, the tournament still spotted new talent – 22‑year‑old Alex Golding won joint first place with Ukrainian GM Alexander Kovchan. Organisers say the next 100th‑anniversary edition will need a new sponsor and will rely on entry fees to cover costs."
