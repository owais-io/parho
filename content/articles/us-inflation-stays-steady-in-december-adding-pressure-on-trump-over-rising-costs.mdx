title: "US inflation stays steady in December, adding pressure on Trump over rising costs"
summary: "Inflation in the U.S. rose 2.7% in the year to December, staying steady and still above the Fed’s 2% goal. Food and housing prices pushed the figure up. Trump says costs are falling and blames the previous administration, but many Americans hold him responsible for rising bills. He’s promised new rules, such as capping credit‑card interest and banning big investors from buying houses. The Fed is at odds with Trump over rate cuts and his attacks on the central bank."
