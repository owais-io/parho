title: "Elites Deny Knowing Jeffrey Epstein After New Emails Surface"
summary: "After new emails from Jeffrey Epstein were released, many well‑known figures say they didn’t really know him. Even after he was convicted for sex‑related crimes, people like Deepak Chopra, Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos and others claim they were unaware of his illegal activities. The pattern is the same: they were invited to parties or had email exchanges, then deny knowledge. The releases have made it risky for anyone who even met Epstein, so denials are common."
