title: "I found a new surfing stream that keeps me hooked"
summary: "I usually watch top World Surf League races, but after the main tour finished, I started watching the Challenger Series. Later, I discovered the Qualifying Series (QS) – the third‑tier competition. Its live streams, even from remote spots with no internet, let fans see upcoming surfers and new surf locations. The streams help small events attract tourists, and fans can follow surfers from the bottom up, making the sport feel more accessible."
