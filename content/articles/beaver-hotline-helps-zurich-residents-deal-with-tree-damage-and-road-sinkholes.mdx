title: "Beaver Hotline Helps Zurich Residents Deal With Tree Damage and Road Sinkholes"
summary: "In Zurich, a growing number of beavers are chewing trees and creating sinkholes, so the city set up a hotline where ecologists give advice, help fix damage, and decide if residents should get compensation. The service calms angry people and keeps beavers under control. Switzerland spends a lot on managing beaver damage, but it also gains big ecological benefits. The plan shows how people can live with wildlife if they get help and guidance."
