title: "Spain’s high‑speed trains crash: 45 dead, sparking safety debate"
summary: "Spain’s high‑speed trains are a national pride, linking its biggest cities quickly and cheaply. But this month, two serious crashes—one derailing near Adamuz, killing 45, and another caused by a collapsed wall that killed a driver—shook the system. Investigations point to old track and weak maintenance, sparking a heated political fight over whether the government is spending enough on repairs versus new lines. Spain still relies heavily on trains, but safety and upkeep need urgent attention."
