title: "UK police set up national team to investigate Epstein allegations"
summary: "British police have created a national task force to handle new allegations that Jeffrey Epstein’s sex‑trafficking network involved UK officials and locations. Three forces – Thames Valley, Surrey and the Met – are reviewing claims against people like Prince Andrew, former minister Peter Mandelson and even airports. The group, led by former Met commander Louisa Rolfe, coordinates investigations and requests full US documents so each force doesn’t duplicate work. Police expect many more accusations as the Epstein files are examined."
