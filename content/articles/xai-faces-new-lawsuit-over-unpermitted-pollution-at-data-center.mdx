summary: "xAI, Elon Musk’s AI firm, is under fire again. The NAACP has filed a second lawsuit claiming the company’s massive data centers in Southaven, Mississippi, are emitting toxic fumes from unpermitted portable methane generators.

A prior case in Memphis was dropped after permits were obtained, but regulators say the turbines still need approval. xAI has not responded."
