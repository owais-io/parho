title: "Hidden War Planes in Stockton’s Wood"
summary: "Speke Hall is famous, but next door is Stockton’s Wood, a quiet forest full of old trees and fungi. It’s also a wartime secret: during World War II the nearby Speke Airport turned into RAF Speke, and planes like P‑51 Mustangs and Halifax bombers were hidden in this wood. The trees were even planted in the 1800s for hunting. Today the wood is a peaceful, biodiversity hotspot that still keeps the memory of hidden aircraft."
