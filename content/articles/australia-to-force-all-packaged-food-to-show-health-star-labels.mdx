title: "Australia to Force All Packaged Food to Show Health Star Labels"
summary: "In Australia, the government has decided that every packaged food must display a Health Star Rating label, because the voluntary system has not been widely used. The rating shows how healthy a product is from half a star to five stars, based on nutrients. Only 37% of foods had labels, so ministers voted to make it mandatory. Health groups say it will help consumers choose better and reduce diet‑related health problems."
