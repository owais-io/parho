title: "What Is Colorectal Cancer and Can You Stop It?"
summary: "Colorectal cancer is a cancer of the colon and rectum. It’s the third most common cancer worldwide, and while overall rates are falling, it’s on the rise in people under 50. Early symptoms—like blood in stool, pain, or weight loss—should prompt a doctor visit. Healthy habits (good diet, regular exercise, no smoking or heavy alcohol) can lower risk. If you have a family history, see a genetic counselor and start screening at age 45 or earlier."
