title: "Trump’s new security plan and why EU leaders are keeping quiet"
summary: "Donald Trump’s latest national‑security plan has a sneaky anti‑European tone, calling migrants “criminals” and suggesting Europe is under threat from a “great replacement”. EU leaders reacted politely but didn’t challenge the racist logic. Meanwhile the EU is tightening asylum rules, speeding deportations and empowering border guards, while still needing workers in many jobs. Many European‑born people of colour face discrimination, but the continent’s leaders rarely speak out. The article calls for a louder defence of diversity."
