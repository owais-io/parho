title: "Australia Day: Time to Question the U.S. Alliance"
summary: "Australia Day is a time for celebrations, but some critics say the nation’s history of colonising First Nations people and its current heavy reliance on the United States, especially under Trump, should be questioned. The author argues that Australia’s self‑image of rugged independence masks deep ties to Britain and America, which may harm its democracy and global standing. The piece calls on Australians to rethink their partnership with Washington and seek more reliable, multilateral cooperation."
