title: "UK to Return Chagos Islands to Mauritius – Trump Criticizes Deal"
summary: "The UK is handing back the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to Mauritius, ending a long‑standing British claim. The move follows a 2019 court ruling that the islands should have been returned when Mauritius became independent. Trump slammed the deal on social media, while UK politicians split over the cost and strategic value. Mauritius will own the islands but the UK keeps a 99‑year lease on Diego Garcia for its military base."
