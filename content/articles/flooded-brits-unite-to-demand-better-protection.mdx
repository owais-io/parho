title: "Flooded Brits Unite to Demand Better Protection"
summary: "People across the UK keep flooding every year, and the damage goes beyond water— it hurts their health and families. Families like Darren Ridley in Folkestone wake at night to check for rising water, suffer sewage spills, and struggle to clean up. Studies show many survivors get no professional help and end up in debt. A new group, Flooded People UK, lets victims speak together to push local councils and national policy for better drains, defenses and support."
