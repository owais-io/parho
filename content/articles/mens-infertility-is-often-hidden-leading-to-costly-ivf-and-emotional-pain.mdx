title: "Men’s infertility is often hidden, leading to costly IVF and emotional pain"
summary: "Men’s infertility is often missed by doctors, forcing couples into expensive IVF and emotional pain. Toby Trice spent six years and two IVF rounds before a private clinic diagnosed a varicocele—treatment that led to a natural pregnancy. Others, like Martin Bowers and Sean Farrell, were misdiagnosed or ignored by NHS GPs and had to seek private help for DNA problems or azoospermia. Experts say more routine tests could save money and heartache."
