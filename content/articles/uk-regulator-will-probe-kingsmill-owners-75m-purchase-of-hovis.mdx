title: "UK regulator will probe Kingsmill owner’s £75m purchase of Hovis"
summary: "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has started a deeper look into a £75m deal that would let Associated British Foods (ABF), owners of Kingsmill and Primark, buy Hovis. The merger would merge the UK's second‑ and third‑biggest sliced‑bread brands, raising worries that fewer choices could mean higher prices. The CMA’s review will run until at least June, and ABF’s stock fell after a profit warning. The deal could take until 2026 to finish."
