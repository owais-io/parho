title: "Drax to Turn Part of Its North Yorkshire Plant into Data Centre"
summary: "Drax is planning to convert a section of its North Yorkshire power plant into a 100‑megawatt data centre by 2027. It will use the plant’s land, cooling, and transformers and will get power from the national grid, though it could use the plant’s own electricity later. The move comes as demand for AI computing rises. Meanwhile, the company faces criticism for burning old‑growth timber for biomass and for relying on government subsidies. Investigations are underway into its sourcing practices."
