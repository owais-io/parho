title: "Britain Needs a New Attitude to Restart Manufacturing"
summary: "The letter argues that Britain can’t get its factories back to life unless people stop thinking of manual work as less important than high‑tech jobs. It says schools should let students choose engineering and craft courses as top options, not afterthoughts. Small makers need more government help—loans, training and support to grow. The writer compares this to France’s “Made in France” push, urging urgent policy change."
