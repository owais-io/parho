title: "People in England’s poorest areas face higher emergency hospital visits for lung problems"
summary: "People living in England’s poorest areas are much more likely to end up in the emergency department for lung problems. They’re 56 % more likely to be admitted and 62 % more likely to come back within 39 days, raising the risk of death. Rates of COPD admissions are almost double in deprived towns such as Blackpool and Manchester. Experts say the gap is avoidable and call for better access to testing, smoking help, clean air and more local services."
