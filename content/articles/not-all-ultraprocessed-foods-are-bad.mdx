title: "Not All Ultra‑Processed Foods Are Bad"
summary: "Ultra‑processed foods (UPFs) aren’t all the same. New research and health groups say animal‑based UPFs like chicken nuggets raise heart disease, diabetes and cancer risk, but plant‑based UPFs such as cereals, canned beans and veggie burgers can actually protect health. Studies show plant UPFs lower diabetes risk and cut heart‑disease death rates, while animal UPFs increase risk. Doctors now say the real issue is too much meat and dairy; picking a veggie burger, even if processed, is usually healthier."
