title: "Trump’s Plan Blames Open Borders, but the Reality Shows Closed Borders Cause Problems"
summary: "Trump’s new National Security Strategy says the U.S. must end migration, claiming unchecked immigration will ruin society and even threaten Europe’s identity. The paper blames open borders for crime, economic strain, and social tension. But the writer, a history professor, points out that most countries in the Americas welcomed immigrants and that the U.S. was largely open for 150 years. He argues the real problems—crime, labor market distortions, and social divides—arise from tight, punitive border policies, not from open borders."
