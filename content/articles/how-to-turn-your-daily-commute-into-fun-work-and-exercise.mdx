title: "How to Turn Your Daily Commute Into Fun, Work, and Exercise"
summary: "Your commute can feel like a stress‑filled grind, but it also gives you five hours a week to use. Start by timing it and adding quick habits—bike part of the way, practice a language, or meditate. Turn travel time into mini “deep work” sessions to brainstorm ideas, and use delays to enjoy extra podcasts. For remote workers, create a small “pretend commute” with a walk or a change in clothes to separate home from work."
