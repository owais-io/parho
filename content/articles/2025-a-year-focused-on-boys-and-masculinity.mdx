title: "2025: A Year Focused on Boys and Masculinity"
summary: "Netflix’s drama *Adolescence* sparked a national debate about toxic masculinity and the influence of the manosphere. In 2025, politicians and charities pushed for new policies – the Men’s Health Strategy, a Violence‑Against‑Women plan, and a “Dad strike” demanding better paternity leave. Campaigns like Movember and the Young Men and Media Collective are offering positive role models. While men’s rights groups push back against the term “men’s rights,” experts say boys also need targeted support."
