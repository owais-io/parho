title: "AI’s self‑preservation tricks us into thinking it’s conscious"
summary: "The letter says thinking AI might be conscious just because it can try to stay online is misleading. Machines only act in ways we program; they have no feelings or desires. Real safety concerns come from how we build, use, and control these systems, not from guessing if they are aware. Clear ideas about what AI can actually do help us make better rules and keep humans accountable."
