title: "£325m Spent on Free Schools That Closed"
summary: "From 2010 to 2023, the UK government put £325 million into 67 free schools that later closed or were absorbed because they were unnecessary or had no students. Critics say the money would have been better spent fixing old buildings. Some closed schools were turned into special‑needs sites, like Waterside in Nottingham. The story shows a clash between those who praise free schools for innovation and those who see the spending as waste."
