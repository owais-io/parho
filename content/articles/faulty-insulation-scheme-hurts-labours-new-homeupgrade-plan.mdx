title: "Faulty insulation scheme hurts Labour’s new home‑upgrade plan"
summary: "Tens of thousands of UK homes were hit by badly installed insulation from the former Conservative Eco scheme, causing huge repair bills and health risks. The new Labour‑run Warm Homes Plan plans to spend £15 bn on clean‑energy upgrades, but experts worry it favours solar panels and heat pumps over proper insulation. The plan could help vulnerable households, but how much will go to insulation is still unclear. The sector is losing jobs and needs better quality control."
