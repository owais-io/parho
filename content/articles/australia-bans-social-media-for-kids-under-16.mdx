title: "Australia Bans Social Media for Kids Under 16"
summary: "Australia has made the first law that stops people under 16 from using big social‑media apps like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. From this week, the sites must delete under‑16 accounts and block new sign‑ups. Firms that ignore the rule could face fines of up to $49.5 million. Some kids still get past age checks, and parents are split – some see it as protection, others worry kids will find ways around it. The ban is being closely watched and studied."
