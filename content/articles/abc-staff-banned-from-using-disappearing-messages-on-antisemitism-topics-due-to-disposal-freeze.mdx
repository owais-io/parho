title: "ABC staff banned from using disappearing messages on antisemitism topics due to disposal freeze"
summary: "ABC journalists covering antisemitism, extremism and related topics can’t use disappearing‑message apps like Signal because a disposal‑freeze order from the National Archives says all communications on those subjects must be kept intact. The order also stops deleting emails on the same subjects. It applies to ABC and other Commonwealth agencies. The notice is similar to one the ABC received in 2020. ABC also issued a correction after wrongly attributing quotes about Israel’s president in a radio bulletin."
