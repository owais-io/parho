title: "In 2019, President Trump was unhappy with how U.S. museums, especially the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., talked about American history. He said they were “woke” and that museums should show a more positive view of America."
summary: "Trump issued an executive order that forced museums to change any words he found divisive. He asked Smithsonian staff to give him a lot of information about their exhibits and then told them to change everything that didn’t fit his idea of “American greatness.”   The Smithsonian’s director, Lonnie Bunch, and other museum leaders had to decide how to respond. Some museums kept showing stories about slavery, racism and other tough topics. Others tried to stay neutral or add more voices from people of colour and women.   The threat from Trump was that if museums didn’t comply, they could lose federal funding. Bunch wrote to his staff that the Smithsonian still makes its own decisions and that it has always been independent.   Even museums far from Washington, like the Milwaukee Art Museum or Chicago’s Art Institute, saw less pressure. But in D.C., museum leaders were preparing for possible hearings and demands from the White House.   So, in short: Trump tried to make U.S. museums show only the good side of American history. Some museums fought back, while others had to play along. The article shows how much pressure museums were under in 2019‑2020."
