title: "Supreme Court's TikTok Ban Decision Sparks Free Speech Debate"
summary: "Supreme Court said TikTok could be banned for national security, even though critics said it would hurt free speech. The ban, aimed at preventing China from accessing U.S. data, was passed by Congress in 2023. The court didn’t question lawmakers’ motives or the evidence. President Trump kept suspending the ban, so TikTok is still on the market. This ruling may influence future cases where national security is used to limit speech."
