title: "Scientists show how a tiny protein injection could make older eggs better for IVF"
summary: "Researchers have found that giving older women's eggs a tiny dose of a protein called Shugoshin 1 can cut chromosome errors in half. The treatment was tested on donated eggs and reduced the defect from 53% to 29% in general, and from 65% to 44% in women over 35. If the method works in larger trials, it could mean older women may need fewer IVF cycles and lower miscarriage rates."
