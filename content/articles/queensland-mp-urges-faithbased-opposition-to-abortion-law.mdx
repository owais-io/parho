title: "Queensland MP urges faith‑based opposition to abortion law"
summary: "Mackay MP Nigel Dalton, a member of Queensland’s Liberal National Party, broke ranks with his party over the state’s abortion laws. He urged fellow MPs to “put on the full armour of God” and speak out, saying he regretted voting for a gag on the issue in the election. Dalton crossed the floor to vote against a motion that would have let the cross‑bench call for a review of the law. The premier said the party’s stance remains unchanged."
