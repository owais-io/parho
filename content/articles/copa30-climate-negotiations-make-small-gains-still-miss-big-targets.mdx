title: "Copa30: Climate Negotiations Make Small Gains, Still Miss Big Targets"
summary: "The world’s climate conference in Brazil saw a narrow, voluntary deal that keeps the promise to move away from fossil fuels, but it isn’t a hard rule. Rich countries will give developing nations $120 bn a year for climate adaptation, but the money starts in 2035, not 2030. A plan to stop deforestation was left out, and many countries say the finance promised by richer nations is still missing. While the talks ended, many still expect more decisive action."
