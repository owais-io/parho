title: "Australia’s Budget Update: Slight Savings, Higher Inflation, and Rate‑Hike Outlook"
summary: "Australia’s budget shows a small improvement in the deficit thanks to higher commodity prices and new savings. But the deficit is still $36.8 bn, bigger than last year, and debt stays near $1 tn. The government added $233 m for CSIRO, $98 m to train 6,000 tradespeople, and $1.1 bn for free mental‑health services. Inflation is expected to stay above 3.5 % until 2026, so the Reserve Bank may raise rates soon, which could hurt wages."
