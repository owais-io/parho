title: "Europe’s Night Train Revival Is Stalling – Why It Matters"
summary: "Europe’s big push to cut emissions made night trains look promising—they use far less energy than planes and could bring fresh jobs. But the revival is stalling because governments pulled money and the trains are still too expensive. Even though many people want night travel, high taxes and track fees make it costly. Without new funding and cheaper access, the dream of a modern, green rail network is slipping away."
