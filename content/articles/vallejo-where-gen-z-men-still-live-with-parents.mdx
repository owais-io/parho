title: "**Vallejo: Where Gen Z Men Still Live with Parents**"
summary: "In Vallejo, California, about one‑third of young adults still live with their parents – the highest rate in the country. Men stay home because of safety, family ties, and job uncertainty, and many are single and focused on work. The trend shows a wider Gen Z shift that delays the usual steps of adulthood, like moving out or getting married. It also changes dating: people avoid apps and casual sex and put stability first."
