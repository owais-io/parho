title: "Trump Cuts EPA Climate Rules, Lets More Pollution Slip Through"
summary: "The Trump administration has removed a key EPA rule that says climate‑changing gases endanger public health. Without that rule, the EPA can’t force cars, trucks and factories to reduce heat‑trapping emissions. The decision is seen as a win for oil, gas and big polluters and a threat to health, with California and many environmental groups planning lawsuits. Experts warn it could lead to more wildfires, heat deaths and flooding."
