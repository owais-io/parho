title: "UK Services Firms Keep Cutting Jobs by Relying on Automation"
summary: "UK services firms are still trimming staff, turning to automation instead of hiring new workers, the latest PMI survey shows. Employment fell in January, marking the longest stretch of job cuts in 16 years, and the sector is also not filling voluntary departures. Rising wages, taxes and energy costs are squeezing margins. Despite this, activity is back to growth, with the PMI hitting a five‑month high and overall business activity up after the budget."
