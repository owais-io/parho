title: "Labour Leader Should Listen to Party Critics, Says Letter"
summary: "The letter says Labour has done some good things but Keir Starmer’s slow, back‑and‑forth style is hurting the party. The writer warns that the leader’s lack of clear direction makes people think he is weak and keeps critics angry inside the party. He suggests Starmer should listen more to his opponents or even step aside so a new leader can unite Labour and keep the far right out of power."
