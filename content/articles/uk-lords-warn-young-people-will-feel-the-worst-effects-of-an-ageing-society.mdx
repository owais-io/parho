title: "UK Lords warn: Young people will feel the worst effects of an ageing society"
summary: "A House of Lords report says the UK's growing older population will hurt public finances and everyday life, and that young people and future generations will bear the biggest burden. The report criticises governments for ignoring the adult social‑care crisis and says simply raising the pension age, encouraging more immigration or higher birth rates won’t solve the problem. Instead, it recommends keeping people in their 50s and 60s working longer and fixing the care system to ease pressure on the economy."
