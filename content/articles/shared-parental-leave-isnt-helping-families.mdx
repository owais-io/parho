title: "Shared Parental Leave Isn’t Helping Families"
summary: "Shared parental leave, introduced in 2015, is barely used—only a few percent of dads and even fewer moms take it. Most fathers don’t even know it exists, and the money they can earn is too low to make sense, especially for lower‑income families. Companies rarely pay more for dads, so many skip the benefit. A new review is underway and activists want more paid days for dads. If both parents take leave, families and the economy benefit."
