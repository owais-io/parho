title: "Phillips 66 buys collapsed Lindsey refinery, plans to merge with Humber plant"
summary: "Phillips 66, a U.S. energy company, bought the collapsed Prax Lindsey refinery in north Lincolnshire. Instead of restarting the site as a separate refinery, the company will combine its operations with the nearby Humber refinery it already owns. The move keeps most of the remaining staff employed until March, but the future of the Lindsey site is uncertain. The sale is seen as the best option for creditors and a boost to UK fuel supply."
