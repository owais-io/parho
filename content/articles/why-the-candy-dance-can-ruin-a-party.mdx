title: "Why the “Candy” dance can ruin a party"
summary: "The article talks about the popular “Candy” dance, which started as the electric slide and became famous in the UK after a 1999 film. The writer hates it because it tires people out, forces them to leave early, and makes the DJ look bad. It also only works for one style of dancing, so those who can’t keep up feel left out. Overall, the author thinks the dance ruins parties."
