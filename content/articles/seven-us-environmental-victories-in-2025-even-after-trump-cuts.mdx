summary: "Despite 2024 rollbacks, U.S. conservationists had seven wins in 2025. California’s methane‑tracking satellite spotted and shut 10 big leaks, cutting emissions like 18,000 cars a year. Hawaii scientists found fungi that eat plastic, boosting cleanup. A study linked bee losses to virus‑carrying mites. Long Island’s dead‑zone shrank to 18 sq mi. San Diego’s Snap‑X gel speeds coral settlement, and New Mexico invested $50 m in wildlife crossings. Arizona’s solar nets cut sea‑turtle bycatch by 63 %."
