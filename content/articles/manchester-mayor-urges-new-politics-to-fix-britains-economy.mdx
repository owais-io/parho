title: "Manchester Mayor Urges New Politics to Fix Britain’s Economy"
summary: "Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, blames Britain’s troubles on the 1980s deindustrialisation, privatisation, austerity and Brexit. He praises Manchester’s “Manchesterism” – a local model that restores public services, builds council housing, re‑industrialises the region and offers new jobs and learning paths. He says the country should copy this approach, push for electoral reform and move away from Westminster’s top‑down politics to revive growth and curb costs."
