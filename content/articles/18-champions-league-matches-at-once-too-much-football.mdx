title: "18 Champions League Matches at Once: Too Much Football"
summary: "I tried to watch 18 Champions League group‑stage matches at the same time. The flood of TV screens and stats made it hard to keep up, but a few moments—like a goalkeeper scoring and sudden table shifts—kept me hooked. The writer says such marathons can be fun but also overwhelming and may become a one‑off event rather than a regular habit. Fans may prefer a simpler, slower pace."
