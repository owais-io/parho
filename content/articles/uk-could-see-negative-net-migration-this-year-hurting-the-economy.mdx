title: "UK could see negative net migration this year, hurting the economy"
summary: "UK immigration rules have tightened, cutting foreign student applications and the number of skilled workers entering the country. Universities and industries now struggle to fill jobs, and the Treasury could lose billions in tax revenue. Official data suggests net migration could fall below zero this year – the first time since 1993 – which experts say could shrink national income by up to 4% by 2040. Some economists argue the dip is temporary and may recover later in the decade."
