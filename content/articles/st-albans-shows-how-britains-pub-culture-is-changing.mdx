title: "St Albans Shows How Britain’s Pub Culture Is Changing"
summary: "In 2024, more than 400 pubs shut across England and Wales. St Albans, close to London, still has many pubs because it was a coaching hub and the Beerhouse Act let people open pubs cheaply. The town’s pubs survive thanks to a tight‑knit owner network, a local campaign, and a steady flow of locals and tourists. Young drinkers are now drinking less, the pandemic has shifted habits, and rising taxes and costs keep pubs fighting to stay open."
