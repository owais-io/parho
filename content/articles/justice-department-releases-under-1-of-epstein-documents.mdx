title: "Justice Department Releases Under 1% of Epstein Documents"
summary: "The U.S. Justice Department has only released a tiny fraction of the documents related to Jeffrey Epstein—less than 1% of the 2 million files. Critics say the department is slow because it wants to keep victims’ identities private. Democrats are pushing for a faster release and threatening legal action. So far, the documents posted are heavily redacted and don’t reveal new details about Epstein’s co‑conspirators."
