title: "US‑Israel Attack on Iran Undermines Trump‑Iran Talks"
summary: "In July, the US and Israel launched a 10‑day strike on Iranian sites just days before scheduled talks, showing Washington was not ready to negotiate. The attack undermines any hope Tehran would take a deal seriously. While the US claimed a nuclear agreement could allow no high‑enriched uranium and full IAEA oversight, the strike signals a preference for force over diplomacy. Iran and allies see it as proof the US will never fully trust the regime."
