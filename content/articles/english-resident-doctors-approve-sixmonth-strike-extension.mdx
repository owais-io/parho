title: "English resident doctors approve six‑month strike extension"
summary: "Resident doctors in England voted to keep striking for another six months, with 93% of the 26,700 who took part supporting the move. They want a 26% pay rise and more training spots for junior doctors—governments promise more posts but still fall short. The strikes have already cost the NHS about £250 m and disrupted services, and a deal is still needed to end further walkouts."
