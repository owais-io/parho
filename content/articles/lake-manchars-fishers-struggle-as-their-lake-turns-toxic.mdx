title: "Lake Manchar’s Fishers Struggle as Their Lake Turns Toxic"
summary: "Lake Manchar in Pakistan used to be a thriving water‑world with 200 fish species and many birds. But a canal from the 1990s now dumps farm chemicals, sewage and industrial waste into the lake. Coupled with less rain and two dams on the Indus, the water has become salty and oxygen‑poor, killing fish and birds. The Mohana people, who once lived on boats, now live on shore and hunt birds for food, but their homes and the wildlife are vanishing."
