title: "BBC in Trouble Without Big Funding Changes, Says Ex-Director"
summary: "Tim Davie, the BBC’s former chief, warned that the broadcaster could be in serious trouble if it doesn’t overhaul its licence‑fee system. He said the fee should be made more progressive and not just raised, and that the BBC must stay free from advertising or subscription models. Davie also pushed for stronger governance and independence after a series of editorial crises. He’s now looking for a new director who can negotiate the next charter."
