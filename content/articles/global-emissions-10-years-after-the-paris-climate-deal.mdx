title: "Global emissions 10 years after the Paris climate deal"
summary: "A decade after the Paris climate agreement, the world has made big gains in clean energy, with renewables growing 15% and investing over $2 trillion. Electric cars now make up a fifth of new cars, and low‑carbon power tops half of China and India’s output. But the US has pulled back, and China’s coal use has jumped again, showing the deal still needs stronger commitments and fair money for poorer nations."
