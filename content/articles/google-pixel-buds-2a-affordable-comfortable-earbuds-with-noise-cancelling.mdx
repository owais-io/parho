title: "Google Pixel Buds 2a: Affordable, Comfortable Earbuds with Noise Cancelling"
summary: "Google’s new Pixel Buds 2a are tiny, light, and comfy. They come with noise‑cancelling, a replace‑able case battery, and touch controls. At £109 (about $129), they beat rivals in price. The buds fit snugly without a long stalk and hold in place with a silicone ring. Battery life is about seven hours with ANC, and the case gives a total of 20 hours. Sound is clear, though some extra features like voice‑control gestures are missing."
