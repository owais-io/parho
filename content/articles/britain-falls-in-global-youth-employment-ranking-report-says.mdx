title: "Britain Falls in Global Youth Employment Ranking, Report Says"
summary: "PwC’s study says Britain’s youth employment ranking fell to 27th out of 38 OECD countries, showing young people are struggling more than ever. Youth unemployment is 15.3%, over three times the overall rate, and almost a million 16‑to‑24‑year‑olds are not studying or working. The government has pledged a “youth guarantee” and 350,000 training spots, but employers warn costs are too high. If the hardest‑hit areas catch up, the economy could gain up to £26bn."
