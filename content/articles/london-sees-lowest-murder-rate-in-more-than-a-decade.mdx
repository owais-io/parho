title: "London sees lowest murder rate in more than a decade"
summary: "London had just 97 murders in 2025, the fewest in more than a decade. That's a homicide rate of 1.07 per 100,000 people, down from 1.11 in 2014. Fewer young people were killed and stab injuries fell 29% over five years. Police say better data and preventive work, like youth workers in custody centres, helped. Some politicians still claim London is unsafe, but the numbers show violence is falling."
