title: "Rainy walk lets me spot spoonbill birds"
summary: "I walked on a rainy saltmarsh track in the UK, and the heavy weather made it hard to move but rewarded me with a close look at spoonbill birds. The article describes the quiet, wet scene and the return of spoonbills after centuries of decline. Conservation work and milder winters have helped the species come back to a few places. Watching them sleep and search in the water shows how fragile and hopeful their habitat is."
