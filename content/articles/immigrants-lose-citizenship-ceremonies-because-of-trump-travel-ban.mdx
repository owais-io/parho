title: "Immigrants Lose Citizenship Ceremonies Because of Trump Travel Ban"
summary: "In Boston, hopeful new citizens were cut off from their oath ceremony because of a Trump travel‑ban list. USCIS told applicants from 19 countries to wait, citing a memo after a National Guard shooting. The move has cancelled or delayed ceremonies in cities across the country and stalled green‑card and interview processes for people from Iran, Haiti, Sudan, Afghanistan and others. Many feel cheated and fear future raids, while advocates warn the policy is part of a broader anti‑immigrant push."
