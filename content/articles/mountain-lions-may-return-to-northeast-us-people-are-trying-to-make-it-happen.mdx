title: "Mountain Lions May Return to Northeast U.S. – People Are Trying to Make It Happen"
summary: "A wildlife photographer in Vermont last summer claimed to see a mountain lion, a species that disappeared from the area in 1881. An organization called Mighty Earth is pushing for the predator’s return, arguing that it would help control deer, improve forests and reduce Lyme disease. Most Vermonters support the idea, but worries about livestock and safety remain. If the plan succeeds, the state could start a bigger rewilding effort with other big animals."
