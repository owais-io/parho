title: "California farms used millions of pounds of toxic PFAS chemicals on major crops"
summary: "From 2018‑2023, California farmers sprayed about 15 million pounds of PFAS‑containing pesticides on crops like almonds, pistachios, grapes, alfalfa and tomatoes. PFAS are called “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down and can build up in food and water. The study warns that water‑rich produce may take up more PFAS, and the chemicals also threaten farmworkers and water supplies. The Environmental Working Group led the review, and the EU has already banned many of the PFAS used in U.S. pesticides."
