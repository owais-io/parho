title: "Gail’s to open 40 new bakeries after sales jump"
summary: "Gail’s, a popular UK bakery, saw sales jump 20% last year to £278 m, but the company still lost money because it spent £51 m on opening 36 new shops. The chain now has 185 sites and plans to add 40 more. Most sales come from its retail cafés, while it also supplies supermarkets like Waitrose. Growth has drawn protests in some towns, and investors are looking for more expansion."
