title: "UK should raise the age for criminal responsibility to at least 14"
summary: "Letter writers argue the UK should raise the age at which children can be tried for crimes from 10 to at least 14, like most European countries. They say that setting the age low actually increases reoffending and ignores research. They cite Norway’s welfare‑focused handling of two six‑year‑olds who killed a five‑year‑old, which led to rehabilitation instead of harsh punishment. The writers warn that Labour must act, otherwise it will face shame."
