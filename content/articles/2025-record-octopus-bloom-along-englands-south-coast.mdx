title: "2025: Record Octopus Bloom Along England’s South Coast"
summary: "Record numbers of octopuses along England’s south coast in 2025 sparked a “bloom” that saw 233,000 caught—about 13 times normal. A mild winter and warm spring helped more larvae survive, and the sea also saw rare sightings of sea slugs and Mediterranean fish. The Wildlife Trusts also noted record seal and puffin numbers, but faced tanker wrecks and bio‑bead spills."
