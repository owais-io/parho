title: "China is the real power behind Myanmar's upcoming election"
summary: "China is helping Myanmar’s military win back territory and push ahead with a controversial election starting Sunday. Beijing closed borders, supplied new drones, and pressured rebel groups to back down. The junta, led by Min Aung Hlaing, will run the vote with little opposition and will probably keep the military in charge. China wants stability and has sent observers, but it could pull support if the army fails to meet its promises."
