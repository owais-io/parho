title: "Bor’s New Water Plant Turns Flood Damage into Clean Water"
summary: "After a huge flood in 2020, the town of Bor in South Sudan struggled to get clean water. A new water plant built with Dutch and Korean money now uses solar power and pumps clean water to 80% of residents. It also helps schools, farmers and women who run local kiosks. The project shows how a town can turn flood damage into a stronger, cleaner water system, but more help is still needed across the country."
