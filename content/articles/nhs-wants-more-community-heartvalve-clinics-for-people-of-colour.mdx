title: "NHS wants more community heart‑valve clinics for people of colour"
summary: "A small pilot in south London found that many people of colour have undiagnosed heart‑valve problems, and they’re less likely to get treatment than white patients. The NHS wants to roll out community clinics that quickly screen and treat valve disease. Six months of the pilot saw 168 patients, 55 % from minority groups, and 35 % needing serious treatment. Expanding the scheme could reduce health gaps and save money."
