title: "Rare Winter Owl Sighting in Somerset"
summary: "A person driving across Somerset thought he saw a gatepost, but it turned out to be a short‑earred owl, a species that used to visit the area in winter but has become rarer. The owl was quick, flying away as soon as it was spotted. The observer's kids also saw owls recently, and they’re starting to enjoy birdwatching. The sighting shows owls are still present but less common."
