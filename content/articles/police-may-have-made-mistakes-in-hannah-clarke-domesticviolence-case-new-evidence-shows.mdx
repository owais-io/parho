Officers didn’t flag the danger or open criminal complaints, so the family wasn’t protected. A whistle‑blower says the coronial inquest ignored these earlier police mistakes. Detectives later questioned the truth of Clarke’s claims, which could have saved lives. The case highlights gaps in how police handle domestic‑violence reports and the need for better training."
