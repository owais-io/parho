title: "UK Rejoins Erasmus: How It Works and Who Can Benefit"
summary: "The UK will re‑join the EU’s Erasmus+ programme in 2027‑28, after five years out of the system. A new UK agency will run it, with applications opening in mid‑2026. Students, apprentices, teachers and schools can apply through their institutions, not directly. The first year costs £570 m, a 30 % discount, and the government will monitor the impact on young people. The move has earned support from Liberal Democrats and criticism from some Conservatives."
