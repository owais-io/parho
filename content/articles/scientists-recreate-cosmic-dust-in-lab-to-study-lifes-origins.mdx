title: "Scientists Recreate Cosmic Dust in Lab to Study Life’s Origins"
summary: "A PhD student at the University of Sydney made a tiny version of space dust in a glass tube. By mixing gases that float around dying stars and blasting them with high voltage, she produced particles that look like real meteorite dust. Studying these helps scientists learn how the building blocks of life may have traveled to Earth. The technique could also help future experiments on how life first appeared."
