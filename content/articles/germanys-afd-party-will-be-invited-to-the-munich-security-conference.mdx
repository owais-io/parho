summary: "The Munich Security Conference (MSC) has decided to invite members of Germany’s far‑right AfD to its 2026 event after keeping them out for two years. The change came after US Vice‑President Mike Pence criticized the exclusion, saying it stifles free speech. MSC organizers said they invite all Bundestag MPs on foreign‑affairs and defence committees, but some German politicians worry it could give the AfD access to sensitive discussions."
