title: "Labour fears wipeout after Lancashire election timetable reversal"
summary: "The government reversed its plan to postpone local elections in Lancashire, forcing seven councils to vote in May instead of next year. Labour officials worry the sudden timetable will leave them almost wiped out, as Reform UK and independents are expected to win many seats. Some council leaders support the move, but it will cost over £100,000 to run the polls and disrupt local services. The changes are part of a re‑organisation that will merge councils by 2028."
