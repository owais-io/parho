title: "Democrats Open Investigation After EPA Removes Air Pollution Benefit Rule"
summary: "More than 30 Democratic senators are asking the EPA to explain why it stopped giving a dollar value to the health benefits of cleaner air, like fewer asthma attacks and deaths. The change removes the legal footing that let the EPA control greenhouse gases. Senators led by Sheldon Whitehouse want the agency to show how it made the decision and whether it consulted experts. They say the move weakens the Clean Air Act and supports fossil‑fuel interests."
