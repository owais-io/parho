title: "Black contestants may be unfairly targeted on The Traitors reality show"
summary: "The article argues that Black contestants are often kicked out early on The Traitors because of racial bias. It compares the show’s treatment to real‑life examples where Black people are unfairly suspected or judged. The writer says that stereotypes and unconscious prejudice make Black participants appear “suspicious” or “angry” when they are simply being confident. Reality TV, the author says, mirrors everyday racism and shows that being Black can still bring unfair treatment."
