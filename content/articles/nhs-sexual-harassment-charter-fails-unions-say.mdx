title: "NHS Sexual Harassment Charter Fails, Unions Say"
summary: "An NHS plan to stop sexual harassment has not worked, unions say. The Safety Charter launched in September 2023 promised zero‑tolerance for unwanted behaviour, but the number of NHS workers calling for help has jumped from 11% to 22% of the charity’s callers. Trusts report only a handful of incidents, while a staff survey says almost 4% have faced harassment. Unions call for clearer rules and real action."
