title: "US diet rules call for more meat, could destroy forests"
summary: "The Trump administration has issued new diet rules that tell Americans to eat more meat and dairy. If people follow them, the US would need about 100 million extra acres of farmland each year—roughly the size of California—to raise the animals. That would clear forests, boost greenhouse‑gas emissions, and hurt the planet. Experts say we can get protein from plants instead, which is much kinder to the environment."
