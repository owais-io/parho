title: "Papua New Guinea Faces HIV Crisis as U.S. Aid Cuts Leave Clinics Struggling"
summary: "Papua New Guinea says HIV is a national crisis after new infections doubled since 2010. In 2024, 11,000 people got the virus, almost half are children or under 25, and many mothers didn’t know they were infected. The country depends on U.S. aid for clinics, but a Trump‑era cut shut down hundreds of centers and cut staff pay. While Australia is stepping in, leaders say the nation must find its own funding to fight the spread."
