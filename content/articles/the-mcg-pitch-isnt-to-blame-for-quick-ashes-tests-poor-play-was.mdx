title: "The MCG pitch isn’t to blame for quick Ashes tests – poor play was"
summary: "The MCG curator had to explain why the recent Ashes matches finished in only a couple of days. Some people point to the pitch, but the real issue was sloppy cricket. Australian bowlers and batters made many mistakes, and England’s players adopted a “play the ball, not yourself” mindset. The pitch itself was not the worst it had ever been, and good technique could have changed the results."
