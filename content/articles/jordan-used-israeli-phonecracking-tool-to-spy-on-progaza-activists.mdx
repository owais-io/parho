title: "Jordan used Israeli phone‑cracking tool to spy on pro‑Gaza activists"
summary: "A Citizen Lab study says Jordan’s security forces have used an Israeli phone‑analysis tool called Cellebrite to dig into the phones of people who support Gaza. Between 2024 and 2025 the agency seized devices from activists, students, and a human‑rights defender, getting photos, chats, passwords and more. The report says this likely breaches Jordan’s human‑rights commitments. Jordan didn’t reply, and Cellebrite says it only sells tools for lawful use."
