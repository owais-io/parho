title: "Chile's Presidential Runoff: Right‑wing Candidate Kast Favored to Win"
summary: "Chile is holding a presidential runoff on Sunday. The front‑runner is José Antonio Kast, a right‑wing, Trump‑style candidate who wants to build walls and deport undocumented migrants. He faces Jeannette Jara, the left‑wing former labour minister. Compulsory voting could change results, as many new voters are skeptical of politics. Kast’s supporters cite security fears, while Jara promises prisons and new immigration rules. Polls show Kast ahead, but the outcome remains uncertain."
