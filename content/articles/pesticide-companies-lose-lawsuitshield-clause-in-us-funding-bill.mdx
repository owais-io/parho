title: "Pesticide companies lose lawsuit‑shield clause in US funding bill"
summary: "A new US funding bill has been cleared of a clause that would have let pesticide makers like Bayer avoid lawsuits. The rider, pushed by Bayer, would have stopped states from warning people about chemical dangers and made it harder to sue if the EPA’s rules were outdated. Representative Chellie Pingree fought the language and got it removed, thanks to support from health‑advocacy groups. The move means farmers and consumers can still challenge pesticide companies."
