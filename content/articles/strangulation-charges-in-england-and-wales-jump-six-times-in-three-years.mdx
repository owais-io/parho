title: "Strangulation charges in England and Wales jump six times in three years"
summary: "Since a 2022 law made strangulation a separate crime, the number of people charged rose from 1,483 last year to 8,545 this year – a six‑fold jump. The new offence lets judges give up to five years in prison, up from six months for common assault. More victims are coming forward, police spot abuse better, and prosecutors are using the law more, leading to longer sentences."
