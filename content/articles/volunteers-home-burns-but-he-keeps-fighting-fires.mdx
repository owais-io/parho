title: "Volunteer’s Home Burns, But He Keeps Fighting Fires"
summary: "The weekend blaze in Longwood, Victoria, destroyed Simon Crisp’s home, leaving only a chimney and a bathtub. Though he’s exhausted and without a place to stay, he patched his blisters at the command centre and returned to the fire truck to help other crews. The fire, driven by 46 °C heat and strong winds, forced more than 700 firefighters to tackle 40 fires, and community hubs like the White Hart hotel stepped up to supply water, food and shelter to residents."
