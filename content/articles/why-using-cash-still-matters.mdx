title: "Why Using Cash Still Matters"
summary: "The letter argues that many rural residents still need cash for everyday purchases and community events. Using cash encourages face‑to‑face interaction and helps people see how much things cost. The writer warns that digital payments can create a “digital apartheid,” pointing out that in London an Oyster card costs £10, a high fee for a cheap card. In other cities like Athens the card is free. Those who only use cash are often turned away from shops and venues."
