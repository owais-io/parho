title: "Keir Starmer’s dull committee meeting leaves no new information"
summary: "Keir Starmer sat down with a parliamentary committee that ran on a dull, slow pace. The session felt more like a formality than a real discussion, with no new information. Committee members asked trivial questions, and Starmer mainly defended routine government actions. The meeting ended with few concrete outcomes, leaving everyone frustrated and questioning the purpose of the gathering. Observers noted the meeting highlighted the routine nature of politics more than substantive debate."
