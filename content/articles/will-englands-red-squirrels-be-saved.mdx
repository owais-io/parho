title: "Will England’s Red Squirrels Be Saved?"
summary: "England’s red squirrels, once numbering 3.4 million, are now down to about 287,000, mainly in Scotland. The non‑native grey squirrel, brought from America in the 19th century, outcompetes reds and carries a deadly disease. The government’s new plan aims to build more woodland, remove greys from key areas, and test a contraceptive vaccine and pine martens to help red squirrels recover. Volunteers like farmer Sam Beaumont are already working on the ground."
