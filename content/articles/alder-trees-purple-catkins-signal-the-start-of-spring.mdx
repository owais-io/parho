title: "Alder Trees’ Purple Catkins Signal the Start of Spring"
summary: "After wet weeks, I’m trudging through soggy fields in my leaky boots, but a line of alder trees keeps me going. Their branches show bright purple catkins that are starting to open, hinting that spring is coming. These early flowers give bees pollen, while the trees also produce green seed cones that finches eat. Alders are hardy, clean up soil, and even helped build places like Venice, so they’re both pretty and useful."
