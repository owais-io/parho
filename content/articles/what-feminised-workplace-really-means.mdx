title: "What ‘feminised workplace’ really means"
summary: "Researchers explain that the phrase is often misused. Some conservative writers say a workplace is bad when many women work there. The real meaning is about how gender shapes jobs, like the shift from heavy industry to service jobs and how women’s pay and hours show inequality. It’s not about stereotypes, but about linking gender and work conditions so all can get fair treatment."
