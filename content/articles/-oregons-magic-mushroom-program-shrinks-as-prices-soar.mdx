title: "** Oregon’s Magic Mushroom Program Shrinks as Prices Soar"
summary: "** Oregon’s 2020 vote made it the first U.S. state to legalise supervised psilocybin therapy. But five years later, the industry is shrinking: licensed centres and facilitators have dropped a third, and most sessions cost nearly $3,000—a price most people can’t afford. Insurance doesn’t cover it, and most clients are white, over 44 and earning more than $95,000, leaving many groups under‑served. The state is reviewing rules and hoping policy changes will broaden access."
