title: "How Orchard Life Depends on Connections"
summary: "While trimming a black Worcester pear, I think about how orchards rely on many links. From the word ‘acre’ meaning a space for feeding pigs to the name Hogshaw, history shows land and animals were linked. Today, trees depend on people who planted and prune them, and on 19 species of pollinating bees. I plant flowers to feed insects, turning scrubland into a thriving habitat that many call a forgotten paradise."
