title: "Coles Facing Court Over Misleading Discount Tactics"
summary: "The Australian regulator ACCC has taken Coles to court, saying the supermarket tricked shoppers with fake discounts. Coles would raise a product’s price, then drop it a little and call it a sale, making the “was” price higher than the real one. The case looks at 245 items and could hurt Coles and Woolworths, which own most grocery stores. The court hearing began in Melbourne and will run for ten days. If found guilty, Coles could face fines and community work."
