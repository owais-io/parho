title: "New Bird‑watching App Turns Spotting Birds Into a Game"
summary: "A new free app called Birdex lets users collect digital cards for UK birds whenever they spot them. Each sighting earns points – rarer birds give more points. Users can add friends, compete, and track their progress. The app uses AI‑generated bird art, which has drawn criticism. Developers say the game encourages kids to get outside and learn about nature, and the data could help science groups. Some worry it might prompt people to hunt protected species."
