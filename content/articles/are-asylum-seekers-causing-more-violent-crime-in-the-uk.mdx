title: "Are asylum seekers causing more violent crime in the UK?"
summary: "The article looks at claims that asylum seekers bring a wave of violent crime to the UK. It explains that the news often focuses on a few shocking cases and paints all migrants as dangerous, but official data shows that foreign‑national crime rates are about the same as those of British citizens. The numbers are hard to compare because the government doesn’t record crimes by immigration status, and many other factors—age, trauma, poverty—also matter."
