title: "Europe Should Follow Mark Carney and Reduce US Dependence"
summary: "European leaders are urged to take Mark Carney’s advice from the World Economic Forum seriously. He says the EU must stop relying on the US and instead build strong trade ties with other countries, diversify supply chains, and stand together against coercive moves such as Trump’s threats over Greenland or tariffs. Unity and new trade deals with nations like Canada, Japan, and Brazil could protect Europe’s rules‑based order and strengthen its global standing."
