title: "Starmer's TikToks Are Surprisingly Okay"
summary: "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has started a TikTok account, hoping to connect with younger voters. His clips show him in casual moments—saying hello, asking about a cat, greeting President Zelensky—intended to look real. But many feel the shots are carefully staged, giving a polished but detached vibe. Fans complain the videos add nothing new, and comments stay generic. While some views show interest, critics say he needs more authenticity."
