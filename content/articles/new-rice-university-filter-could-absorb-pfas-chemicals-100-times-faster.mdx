title: "New Rice University filter could absorb PFAS chemicals 100 times faster"
summary: "Rice University scientists have made a filter that can soak up PFAS, the nasty “forever chemicals”, about 100 times faster than current filters. The new material uses copper‑aluminum layers to pull in the long‑chain PFAS and then can heat them to 400‑500 °C, breaking the chemicals into harmless calcium‑fluoride that can be safely dumped. If it works on a big scale, it could give water plants a cheap, easy upgrade."
