title: "Free medical services for young people leaving care in England"
summary: "England’s government will give young people who leave the care system free prescriptions, dental and eye care until they turn 25. It will also test paid NHS internships and a guarantee that care leavers get NHS job interviews. A three‑year pilot will improve mental‑health help for kids in care. Doctors will be warned if a patient is a care leaver, and information can be shared fast across services. These steps aim to cut health gaps for care leavers."
