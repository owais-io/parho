title: "Afghan Women Keep Secret Book Club to Defy Taliban Rules"
summary: "Five Afghan women meet every Thursday to read books that help them understand life and resist the Taliban’s restrictions. They discuss classics like Orwell’s Animal Farm, Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, and novels about oppression. Some join by phone because of weak internet. Reading gives them hope, teaches them about rights, and keeps their spirits alive despite schools being closed for women. They call their group 'Women with Books and Imagination' and meet in homes to stay hidden."
