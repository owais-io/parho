title: "Social media ban will cut young Australians off from news and politics"
summary: "Australia’s new ban on social‑media accounts for under‑16s will stop teens from seeing clips, games and even news. Leo Puglisi says the main worry is that the ban cuts off young people’s main news source—short videos on TikTok and Instagram—making it harder for them to stay informed. He argues that parents, privacy and political engagement are key, and that teens should still get news on the platforms they use."
