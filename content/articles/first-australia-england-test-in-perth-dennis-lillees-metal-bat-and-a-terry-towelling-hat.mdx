title: "First Australia-England Test in Perth: Dennis Lillee’s Metal Bat and a Terry Towelling Hat"
summary: "In 1979, a 12‑year‑old fan watches Australia play England at Perth’s WACA Ground. The series was a quick deal with TV tycoon Kerry Packer, so no Ashes were contested and the teams wore plain uniforms. Dennis Lillee shocked the crowd by using a shiny aluminium bat, which caused a brawl before he returned to bowl and dismissed England’s openers. Australia won by 138 runs, and the writer keeps looking forward to future Tests at the new Optus Stadium."
