title: "Warming Oceans Slow Births of Southern Right Whales"
summary: "Scientists tracking southern right whales in Australia have found that the animals are now having babies less often. Since 2017, the typical three‑year birth cycle has stretched to four or five years. The change matches the warming of Southern Ocean waters, loss of sea ice, and more marine heatwaves, which reduce krill food supplies. The findings warn that climate change is hurting these long‑lived whales and other cold‑water species."
