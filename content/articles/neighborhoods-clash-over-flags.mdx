title: "Neighborhoods Clash Over Flags"
summary: "In Birmingham’s Stirchley and other towns, a group called Raise The Colours has hung thousands of St George and Union flags on street lights, claiming they show patriotism. Local residents say the flags mark territory for far‑right groups and have sparked harassment, vandalism, and even physical attacks. With little council help, some locals secretly remove flags at night. A poll shows most ethnic‑minority adults see the St George flag as racist, and the city is hesitant to intervene for safety reasons."
