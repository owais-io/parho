summary: "Many young Britons are struggling to find work. In 2025, 18‑24‑year‑olds hit a five‑year high in unemployment, and overall youth unemployment is above the EU average. People like 22‑year‑old Poppy Blackman apply to dozens of jobs every month but rarely hear back. Rising employer costs, a slow economy and tech‑driven hiring add to the problem, leaving a generation at risk of long‑term unemployment."
