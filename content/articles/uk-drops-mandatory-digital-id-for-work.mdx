title: "UK drops mandatory digital ID for work"
summary: "UK officials have scrapped the plan to make digital ID mandatory for anyone who wants to work. People can still use a digital ID if they choose, but employers will no longer need to check it. The change comes as the government talks to the public before finalising the system. Critics say it’s just a political tweak, while supporters say it will help stop illegal working."
