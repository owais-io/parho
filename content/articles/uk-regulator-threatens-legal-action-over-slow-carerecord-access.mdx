title: "UK regulator threatens legal action over slow care‑record access"
summary: "The Information Commissioner (ICO) says people who grew up in care often wait years, sometimes up to 16, to get their own care records. Requests are delayed, pages are cut out, and some files are even destroyed. The ICO has warned local councils it will take legal action if they don’t comply. The regulator wants better record‑keeping and faster, kinder service, so people can understand their past and hold authorities accountable."
