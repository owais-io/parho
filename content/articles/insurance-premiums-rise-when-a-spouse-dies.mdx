title: "Insurance premiums rise when a spouse dies"
summary: "When a spouse dies, some insurers increase home and car premiums – a practice known as the bereavement penalty. In a handful of cases, customers saw their costs jump 10‑15 %. Companies say the change reflects a higher risk for single policyholders, but many find it unfair and hard to explain. A few insurers have refunded extra charges, but the issue points to a lack of transparency in pricing."
