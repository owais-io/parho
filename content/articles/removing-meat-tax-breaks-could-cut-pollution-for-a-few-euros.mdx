title: "Removing Meat Tax Breaks Could Cut Pollution for a Few Euros"
summary: "Scientists say that raising the tax on meat to the same level as other foods could cut climate change, biodiversity loss, and water use by 3‑6%. In many EU countries meat gets a lower VAT, hiding its true environmental cost. If that tax break is removed, households would pay only about €26 a year if the extra money is returned to them, while the planet would benefit from less greenhouse gas and pollution."
