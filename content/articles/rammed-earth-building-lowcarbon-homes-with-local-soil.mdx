title: "Rammed Earth: Building Low‑Carbon Homes with Local Soil"
summary: "Architects are turning to rammed earth—compact soil mixed on site—to create low‑carbon homes. The Wiltshire Rammed Earth House shows how using local clay can cut waste and energy. In Britain, rain and cold can damage raw earth walls, so designers sometimes add lime or use prefabricated blocks from nearby factories. Despite challenges, the material offers good insulation, a natural look, and fits into a circular building process."
