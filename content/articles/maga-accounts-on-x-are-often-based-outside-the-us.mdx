title: "MAGA Accounts on X Are Often Based Outside the US"
summary: "A new feature on X lets anyone see where a profile is located. When it went live, users found many big “Make America Great Again” accounts were actually run from other countries – like Russia, Nigeria, India, eastern Europe, and Thailand. Examples include MAGANationX, IvankaNews, Dark Maga and others. Users say this shows foreign influence and fuels worries about misinformation bots that have grown since Elon Musk bought the platform."
