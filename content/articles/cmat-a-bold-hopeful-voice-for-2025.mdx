title: "CMAT: A Bold, Hopeful Voice for 2025"
summary: "In 2025 people feel constant conflict, high living costs, and a sense of loss. Young folks feel stuck and anxious. Music shows this, too. Irish singer‑songwriter CMAT released her album *Euro‑Country*, singing about loneliness, the housing crisis and online hate, while still playing upbeat love songs. Her stage shows are flashy and fun, but her lyrics keep the focus on hope and defiance. CMAT is the music that captures our time."
