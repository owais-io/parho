title: "Pat Cummins keeps the Ashes – can his team win again?"
summary: "Australia won the Ashes for the third straight series, with captain Pat Cummins holding the trophy for a record‑tying run. He shares the win with former skipper Steve Smith, who led the first two victories while Cummins was out. The side has dominated England this time, but has never won a full series there. With several senior players aging and injuries piling up, fans wonder if the “Dad’s Army” can keep the urn for another year or two."
