summary: "After the Bondi beach attack, people poured money into online fundraisers, raising millions for victims and first responders. Crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe make it easy to give quickly, and have raised over $40 billion worldwide. But the system is uneven: only a few campaigns hit their goals, and some causes get more attention than others. Critics say the money can be misdirected or replace official aid, and donors often lose privacy."
