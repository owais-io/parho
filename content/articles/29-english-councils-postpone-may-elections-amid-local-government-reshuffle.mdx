title: "29 English councils postpone May elections amid local government reshuffle"
summary: "More than 4 million voters in 29 council areas will miss the 7 May polls because the government is reshaping local councils. While most elections stay on schedule, places like Lincoln, Exeter, Norwich, and several districts will vote later, some in 2025 or 2026. Reform UK has launched a court challenge, calling the move a denial of democracy. The government says it’s a practical step toward single‑tier unitary councils and new elections in 2027."
