title: "Logitech MX Master 4: The Best Work Mouse"
summary: "Logitech’s MX Master 4 is a high‑end work mouse that’s still comfortable for long hours. It has eight easy‑to‑reach buttons, a silent magnetic scroll wheel, and a new haptic button that shows quick‑access rings for things like volume or photo tools. It can switch between three devices via Bluetooth or a Logi Bolt dongle and lasts up to 70 days on one charge. At £120 it’s pricey, and the extra haptics need extra app support."
