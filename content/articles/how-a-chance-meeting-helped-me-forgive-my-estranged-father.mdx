title: "How a Chance Meeting Helped Me Forgive My Estranged Father"
summary: "While waiting on an escalator at Berlin Brandenburg Airport, I unexpectedly saw my father, who’d left me years ago. The simple sight made him feel like just another traveler, not a source of hurt. I began to practice “active love,” a technique that lets you send compassion to someone who wronged you. A few weeks later, I met him for lunch, talked openly, and we started texting regularly. The experience showed me that forgiveness is a daily practice, not a one‑time event."
