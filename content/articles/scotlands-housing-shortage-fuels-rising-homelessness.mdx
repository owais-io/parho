title: "Scotland’s Housing Shortage Fuels Rising Homelessness"
summary: "Rough sleeping in Scotland has doubled in three years, with thousands of children in temporary homes. The government promised 110,000 affordable homes by 2032 but has built far fewer. Social housing has not kept up with demand, forcing people into hotels and B&Bs that they can’t afford to leave. A new national housing agency has been announced to try and speed up construction, but the gap remains huge."
