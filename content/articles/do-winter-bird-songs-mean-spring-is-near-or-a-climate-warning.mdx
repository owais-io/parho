title: "Do Winter Bird Songs Mean Spring Is Near or a Climate Warning?"
summary: "During a surprisingly warm December, I heard many birds, like robins, wrens, and song thrushes, sing—birds that usually stay quiet in winter even let loose short songs. A record in 2015 had seven species singing on a sunny day. While this might hint that spring is near, it also raises questions about how warming weather is affecting birds and the planet."
