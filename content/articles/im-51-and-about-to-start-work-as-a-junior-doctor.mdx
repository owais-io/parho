title: "I’m 51 and about to start work as a junior doctor"
summary: "I started medical school at 47 after leaving journalism, and now at 51 I’m ready to begin work as a junior doctor. The past four years have been a mix of fear, awkward exams, and amazing moments with patients. From learning to pull a vein to watching a baby’s seizure, every lesson has felt like a step toward real help. I’m nervous but thrilled to finally be part of the healing team."
