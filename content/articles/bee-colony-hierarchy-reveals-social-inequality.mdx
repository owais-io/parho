title: "Bee Colony Hierarchy Reveals Social Inequality"
summary: "Letters sent to the Guardian cover a mix of odd and serious subjects. One piece paints a beehive as a ruthless hierarchy: worker bees live only weeks, drones die after mating, and the queen enjoys a longer life. Other replies touch on a billionaire’s remarks about immigration, a humorous dream about a marshmallow, a call to avoid political names in Valentine’s letters, and a note about love‑talk. The letters show the range of everyday concerns readers bring to the paper."
