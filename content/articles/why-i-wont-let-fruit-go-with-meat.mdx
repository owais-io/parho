title: "Why I Won’t Let Fruit Go With Meat"
summary: "I’ve written a silly rant about not putting fruit on a meat dish. I’m famous for saying that turkey with cranberry sauce and other fruit‑meat combos are wrong. I love meat, especially with gravy, but I only want fruit as dessert or a side. I’m still a bit strict about this rule, but I’ll happily eat fruit alone or with vegetables. That’s my stand."
