summary: "Court has ruled that the UK unlawfully kept more than 60 Tamil asylum seekers on the remote island of Diego Garcia for three years. The judges said the conditions were like a prison, with rat‑infested tents and constant guard presence. The appeal from the island’s commissioner was rejected, meaning the UK may have to pay millions in damages. The decision confirms earlier findings that the detention was illegal and caused great suffering."
