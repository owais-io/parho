title: "Pubs Get 15% Rate Cut, But Business Rates Still a Mess"
summary: "The chancellor has given pubs a 15% discount on business rates and a two‑year freeze, but the rest of hospitality – restaurants, cafés and hotels – gets no extra help. The move won’t stop rising costs that could hit jobs and closures. Critics say the government only cares about a handful of ‘high‑growth’ sectors, and Labour’s pledge to overhaul the whole rates system still feels unrealised. A bigger reform is needed."
