title: "EU Ready to Respond with Tariffs if Trump Threatens Greenland Trade"
summary: "The European Union is warning that it will use its anti‑coercion law and could hit back with tariffs on about €93 billion of U.S. goods if President Trump follows through on his threat to tax imports from eight countries because of Greenland. EU leaders said the move would protect the bloc’s sovereignty and keep trans‑Atlantic relations from falling apart. They also want to keep the dialogue open, but warn the U.S. that any tariff will hurt both sides."
