title: "Wales Munitions Factory Delay Hangs Up UK Ammo Plans"
summary: "A new munitions plant in Glascoed, Wales, meant to boost Britain’s artillery shell production 16‑fold, hasn’t started yet, even six months after its launch date. BAE Systems said the delay came from a decision to double the plant’s output during construction, which pushed back the schedule. The hold‑up worries the UK army, Ukraine aid and the government’s broader defence spending plans, which already face budget gaps."
