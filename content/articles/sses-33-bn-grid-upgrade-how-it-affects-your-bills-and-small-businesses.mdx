title: "SSE’s £33 bn Grid Upgrade: How It Affects Your Bills and Small Businesses"
summary: "SSE announced a £33 bn investment to modernise the UK grid over the next five years, which sent its shares up 17%. The upgrade aims to fix under‑investment, cut wasted costs and support more renewable energy. Ofgem’s price‑control rules could add higher network charges to electricity bills, with estimates of a 20 % overall rise and even a 70 % jump for small businesses. SSE says it will raise dividends while keeping new equity low, but consumers and SMEs worry about the impact on their bills."
