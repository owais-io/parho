title: "Venezuela Welcomes Trump‑Aligned US TV Network After Maduro Capture"
summary: "After US special forces seized Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela let reporters from the Trump‑aligned Newsmax network travel to Caracas.

The visit was seen as a strategic move by both sides: Venezuela signals it can stay in power, while Trump’s base gets a pro‑US propaganda piece. Opposition groups outraged, and analysts note the odd partnership between an anti‑imperialist regime and a Trump ally."
