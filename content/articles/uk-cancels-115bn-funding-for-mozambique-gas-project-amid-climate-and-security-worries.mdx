title: "UK cancels $1.15bn funding for Mozambique gas project amid climate and security worries"
summary: "The UK has decided to stop a £870m ($1.15bn) loan for a big gas project in Mozambique. The move comes after worries about climate damage, human rights abuses, and attacks by an Islamist group that killed over 800 people in 2021. The French company TotalEnergies wants to restart the project, but UK officials say the risks have grown. Green groups say the money should help clean energy instead."
