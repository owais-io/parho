title: "Cornish youth choose fishing over low‑pay jobs"
summary: "Cornwall’s young people are turning to fishing instead of low‑pay jobs like supermarkets. At a Newlyn taster day, teens learned that a deckhand can earn £22,000‑£30,000 a year, and experienced fishermen say some can make up to £50,000 quickly. The industry supports 7,800 jobs and gives locals a sense of identity. A new network of 70+ young fishers keeps the tradition alive and offers steady work."
