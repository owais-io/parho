title: "Labour’s Vote Crumbles in Manchester’s Gorton and Denton Byelection"
summary: "In a Manchester byelection, many voters are losing faith in Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer. People say he breaks promises, and the party’s once‑strong coalition is splitting: some are turning to the Green Party, others to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. The split shows a mix of anger about immigration, housing and a sense that the government is dishonest. Labour’s grassroots are weak, and many residents feel disconnected and may skip voting altogether."
