title: "EU Lets Member States Use Funds to Help Women Get Safe Abortions"
summary: "The EU has decided that member states can use existing social‑service money to pay for travel and care so women in places like Malta and Poland can get legal abortions elsewhere. The move followed a campaign that gathered 1.2 million signatures and was backed by most parliamentarians. The aim is to cut the 500,000 unsafe abortions that happen in Europe every year. While supporters say it’s a win for women, some national groups say it infringes on their laws."
