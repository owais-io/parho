title: "UK Parliament says prosecutors mishandled China spy case"
summary: "The security committee slammed the Crown Prosecution Service for dropping charges against two men accused of spying for China, calling the handling “shambolic.” The report says confusion and poor communication between the government and the CPS caused the trial to collapse. It found no evidence that politicians interfered, but said the government’s procedures were weak and that senior officials didn’t give enough support. MPs now call for clearer rules and better teamwork between the government and prosecutors."
