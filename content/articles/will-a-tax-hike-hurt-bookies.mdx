title: "Will a tax hike hurt bookies?"
summary: "Chancellery minister Rachel Reeves is likely to raise the taxes bookies and casinos pay. The new duties could cost the industry £1‑3 billion a year. Some say the tax is fair and could help the government, while bookies warn it will cut jobs and push gamblers to illegal sites. Think‑tanks want online gambling taxes to reach 50%, but the industry claims this could lose 40,000 jobs. The government may settle on a middle‑ground hike that adds about £1‑2 billion in revenue."
