title: "NHS spends £164m over budget on ADHD as private clinics grow"
summary: "The NHS is spending £164 million more each year on ADHD services than the budget allows. Much of the extra money goes to private clinics that aren’t strictly regulated. These clinics often give poor or unsafe assessments, and patients can get lost when care moves between private and NHS doctors. Demand for ADHD tests has surged, leaving half a million people waiting. The government is reviewing the system to protect patients."
