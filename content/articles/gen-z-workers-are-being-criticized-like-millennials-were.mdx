title: "Gen Z Workers Are Being Criticized Like Millennials Were"
summary: "Gen Z workers are being called lazy, entitled, and even unemployable – a criticism that echoes what millennials faced years ago. Older bosses often compare the young to their own past, but Gen Z values flexibility, purpose and a healthy work‑life balance more than long hours. They use tools like AI to work smarter and want fair pay. If companies ignore this shift, they risk losing talent and hurting performance. Working together could help both sides learn from each other."
