title: "UK Play Sand Found Contaminated with Asbestos"
summary: "A parent found asbestos in colored play sand sold by Hobbycraft. After testing, three of five colors tested positive, so the retailer pulled the product but hasn't issued an official recall. UK law has no safe asbestos level and, after Brexit, the government can’t order recalls without proof of harm. Safety groups are calling for stronger rules so dangerous items can be removed quickly."
