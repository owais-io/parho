title: "Women’s Rights Are Threatened, but Hope Is Growing in Unexpected Places"
summary: "Across the globe, women face new limits on abortion, freedom, and safety. Yet activists are fighting back: In El Salvador, all 72 women jailed for “abortion” were freed; Russian feminists wear blue‑yellow ribbons to show anti‑war solidarity; Iceland’s strong unions and a historic 1975 strike helped it become a gender‑equal leader. Even in war‑torn Syria’s Rojava region, women run a grassroots, gender‑balanced government that bans child marriage, polygamy and “honour” killings. These stories show that resistance, not just struggle, is shaping a better future."
