title: "Democrats Pull Back Funding for Immigration Agency After Two ICE Deaths"
summary: "After ICE agents killed two unarmed people, some Democrats stopped giving money to the Department of Homeland Security. They now want big changes to how ICE and the border patrol operate, like stopping mass arrests and requiring court orders before searches. A big government budget fight could lead to a shutdown, which would hurt federal workers and people who rely on aid."
