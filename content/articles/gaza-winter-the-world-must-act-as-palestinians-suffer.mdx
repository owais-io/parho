title: "Gaza Winter: The World Must Act as Palestinians Suffer"
summary: "Gaza’s winter is the worst ever, with kids freezing, drowning, and families cooking in unsafe tents. Almost all homes are gone and 1.6 million people can’t get enough food. Israel has stopped 37 aid groups and wants their staff details, claiming Hamas is inside them. It also blocks life‑saving supplies, even though it lets traders bring them in. The UN, U.S., and other countries warn the crisis is catastrophic, but Israel says it’s for security. Global help is urgently needed."
