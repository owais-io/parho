title: "Ask the Guardian Your Questions About the Budget"
summary: "Rachel Reeves released the new budget. She removed the cap on two‑child families, added a tax on very expensive homes, and raised rates for income from savings, dividends and property. Income‑tax limits will stay the same until 2030‑31, and basic rates of tax, VAT and national insurance won't increase, keeping Labour’s promise not to raise taxes on workers. Guardian experts can answer general questions, but won't give personal advice."
