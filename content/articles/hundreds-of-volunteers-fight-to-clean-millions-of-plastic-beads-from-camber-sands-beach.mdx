title: "Hundreds of volunteers fight to clean millions of plastic beads from Camber Sands beach"
summary: "A mechanical failure at a wastewater plant in Eastbourne released millions of tiny black plastic beads onto Camber Sands. Volunteers, families, and a cleanup team have spent days hand‑picking and vacuuming the sand, but the sheer volume makes the task feel impossible. The beads can harm wildlife and food chains, and the local council says more debris will keep arriving. Southern Water has apologized, and MPs want a full investigation and more funding for clean‑ups."
