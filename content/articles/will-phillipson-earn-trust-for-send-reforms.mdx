summary: "Bridget Phillipson, newly appointed education minister, spent her first week trying to win the confidence of new Labour MPs on special educational needs (SEND). The bill that changes academy trusts met fierce criticism, and the government’s previous welfare cuts left MPs wary. Phillipson’s key challenge is building trust: explaining the £4 bn funding, better teacher training and new specialist staff. Many parents and MPs still doubt that the reforms will improve the system."
