title: "Outdated furniture fire rules risk our safety, MP says"
summary: "An MP says Britain still uses fire‑safety rules for furniture that are over 30 years old. The rules let toxic flame‑retardant chemicals stay in sofas, mattresses and chairs, and when those items burn they release dangerous fumes. Even second‑hand furniture can hide these chemicals. The MP wants new tests and clearer rules so we know what chemicals are in our furniture and how they behave in a fire."
