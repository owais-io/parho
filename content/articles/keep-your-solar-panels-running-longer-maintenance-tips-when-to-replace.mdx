title: "Keep Your Solar Panels Running Longer: Maintenance Tips & When to Replace"
summary: "Australia’s homes are full of solar panels, but new research shows 1 in 5 fail earlier than expected, losing up to 45% of power by 25 years. Simple habits can help: install at the right angle, keep panels clean, check wiring and mounts, and schedule service every 2–3 years. If a panel or inverter breaks, you can replace just that part; older systems may be worth a full upgrade."
