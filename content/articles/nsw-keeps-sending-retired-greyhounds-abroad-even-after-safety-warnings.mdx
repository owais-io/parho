title: "NSW keeps sending retired greyhounds abroad, even after safety warnings"
summary: "The New South Wales government says greyhounds that finish racing will still be sent overseas for rehoming, even though an independent review found the practice can be distressing and sometimes deadly. Six dogs died in transport or at U.S. arrival, and the review urged a halt to exporting dogs. The government will add more oversight but won’t stop the program, while track standards still fall short of new rules."
