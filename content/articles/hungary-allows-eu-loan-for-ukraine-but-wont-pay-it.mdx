title: "Hungary Allows EU Loan for Ukraine, but Won’t Pay It"
summary: "Hungary has agreed not to block a €210 bn interest‑free loan from the EU for Ukraine, but only if the loan is guaranteed by other EU members and not by Hungary, Slovakia or the Czech Republic. The deal leaves those three countries off the financial obligations. German leaders said the loan could be repaid using frozen Russian assets, but using those assets is still politically difficult. It is aimed at supporting Ukraine’s military and economic needs for two years."
