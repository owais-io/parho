title: "Health Secretary Boosts Training Slots to Avoid Doctors’ Strike"
summary: "UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has offered to double the number of specialist training places for resident doctors, hoping to stop a planned five‑day strike that could hurt NHS services during a flu surge. The offer adds 4,000 spots in England, but it does not raise salaries. The doctors’ union, the BMA, will let doctors vote on the deal and could cancel the strike if the majority agrees. NHS leaders fear the strike would worsen the busy winter season."
