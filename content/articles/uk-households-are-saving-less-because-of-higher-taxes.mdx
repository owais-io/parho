title: "UK households are saving less because of higher taxes"
summary: "In the third quarter, UK families saved only 9.5% of their disposable income – the lowest level in more than a year – as taxes on wages and wealth rose. Real disposable income fell 0.8%, and economic growth slowed to just 0.1%. The government will keep personal tax thresholds frozen for three years, pushing more workers into higher tax brackets. Though the Bank cut rates, inflation remains above target, and some hope that spending may pick up after the tax‑hike plans were dropped."
