title: "ICE Buys Huge Warehouses to Detain Immigrants in Poor Conditions"
summary: "ICE is buying huge warehouses across the U.S. to turn them into large detention camps for immigrants. The buildings are not meant for people, and reports say conditions are cold, dirty, and overcrowded. The move follows a Trump‑era push to hold more migrants in bigger facilities. Local governments and politicians—both Democrats and some Republicans—are protesting and trying to block the camps, citing human rights and local costs."
