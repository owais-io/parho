title: "Your Party Holds Its First Conference and Chooses Collective Leadership"
summary: "The new left‑wing group built around Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana had its first conference in Liverpool. The event was chaotic, with early squabbles over funding and membership. The party chose a collective leadership model instead of a single boss, and allowed members to keep ties to other parties. While it has about 12% support, it still faces internal divisions and stiff competition from the Greens."
