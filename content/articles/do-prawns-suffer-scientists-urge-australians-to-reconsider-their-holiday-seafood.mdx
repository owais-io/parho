title: "Do Prawns Suffer? Scientists Urge Australians to Reconsider Their Holiday Seafood"
summary: "Around 18.5 million kilos of prawns and 150,000 lobsters are eaten in Australia every Christmas, but new research shows these shellfish can feel fear and pain. Scientists point out that they can learn, remember and even form relationships. Yet many are boiled alive or tied up while still conscious. Some laws protect them, others don’t. Consumers can help by choosing crustaceans that’re killed quickly or flash‑frozen, and by asking how they’re handled."
