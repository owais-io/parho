title: "Learning a Long‑Lost Language at Boobera Lagoon"
summary: "I’ve spent 34 years searching for my Kamilaroi roots, finally heading to Boobera Lagoon where my people have gathered for centuries. With elder Carl McGrady, I learn simple words, taste the salt‑bush, and touch headstones at an old mission. The visit shows how language, land, and stories are tied together, and reminds me that to truly speak our tongue, I must walk its country and feel its water."
