title: "Germany scrubs renewable heating law, lets gas and oil again"
summary: "Germany’s ruling coalition has thrown out a law that pushed new home heating systems to use at least 65 % renewable energy, letting owners choose oil or gas again. The move has angered the Green party, which sees it as a betrayal of climate goals, and has sparked fights between the Greens, the Social Democrats and the cabinet. The change keeps subsidies for heat pumps but lifts the renewable‑only requirement, while the government says it gives people more choice."
