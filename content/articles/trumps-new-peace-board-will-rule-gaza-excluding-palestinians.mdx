title: "Trump’s New ‘Peace Board’ Will Rule Gaza, Excluding Palestinians"
summary: "Trump is setting up a ‘Peace Board’ to govern Gaza, but no Palestinian will sit on it. The board will include former leaders like Tony Blair, property developers, and even Viktor Orbán, with each country asked to pay $1 billion to join. Trump also wants to sell Gaza’s land and move its people. Critics say the plan is a form of neocolonialism and could turn Gaza into a profit‑making project."
