title: "Russia’s Oil Exports Stay Higher Than Pre‑War, Despite Sanctions"
summary: "Russia is still shipping more oil than it did before it invaded Ukraine, a Finnish think‑tank report says, even though Western sanctions aim to choke its trade. Oil exports are 6 % above pre‑war levels, but Russia has to lower prices to keep buyers, so revenue has fallen. Most of the crude heads to China, India and Turkey. Meanwhile Ukraine’s president says Russia failed to win the war and Europe is debating tougher sanctions, with Hungary blocking new measures."
