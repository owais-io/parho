title: "UK plans to make asylum support optional, not automatic"
summary: "UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will roll out a package that makes help for asylum seekers optional rather than guaranteed. The government says it can stop giving money or housing to people who can work or already own assets. Most current support will stay the same, but the new rules could cut costs and let the Home Office deny aid to rule‑breakers. The changes are part of a plan to curb illegal boat crossings and compare to Denmark’s system."
