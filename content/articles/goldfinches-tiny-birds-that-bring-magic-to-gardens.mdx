title: "Goldfinches: Tiny Birds That Bring Magic to Gardens"
summary: "When the author cleared old teasels from the garden, the seeds still attracted goldfinches, so they planted a grove and set up a hide. The birds, with their bright yellow wings and red faces, were a sight to see. Goldfinches have been symbols of hope in medieval art and folk belief, thought to heal the sick. Today, people pay big money for their seed, and the UK’s wild‑bird‑food market is worth £380 million. Goldfinches keep enchanting us from their perches."
