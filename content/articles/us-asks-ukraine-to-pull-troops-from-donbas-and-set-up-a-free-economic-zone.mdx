title: "US asks Ukraine to pull troops from Donbas and set up a free economic zone"
summary: "The U.S. wants Ukraine to pull its troops out of Donbas and set up a ‘free economic zone’ there. President Zelenskyy says the plan is unfair unless Russia is guaranteed not to take over the zone, and he wants a public vote. Washington’s proposal also freezes frontlines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and asks Russia to give up small pockets elsewhere. European leaders say any deal must be decided by Ukrainians, and the EU is still pushing for Ukraine’s membership."
