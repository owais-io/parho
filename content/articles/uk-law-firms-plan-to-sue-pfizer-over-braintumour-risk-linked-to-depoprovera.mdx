title: "UK law firms plan to sue Pfizer over brain‑tumour risk linked to Depo‑Provera"
summary: "In the UK, several law firms are looking into suing Pfizer because many women who used the birth‑control injection Depo‑Provera later developed meningiomas – a type of brain tumour that can cause seizures, vision loss, headaches and memory problems. Studies show a higher risk for users, and some patients report severe, life‑altering symptoms. Similar cases are already being fought in the US, where Pfizer is being accused of not warning doctors or patients about the danger."
