summary: "Since 2019, Britain’s high streets have lost many stores and gained more cafés, restaurants and leisure spots.

The Guardian’s new tool lets you look up your postcode and see how the mix of businesses changed from 2019 to 2025. It doesn’t cover Northern Ireland, and it estimates empty storefronts by comparing current numbers to the busiest years."
