title: "England faces a tough challenge after tragedy"
summary: "After a tragic attack on Sydney’s Jewish community, the third Ashes Test in Adelaide starts with flags at half‑mast and players wearing black armbands. England is 2‑0 down and must win the final match to stay alive. The English team has new bowlers back, but their previous losses have left them feeling uneasy. Australia also has key players returning, and a heatwave is expected. The game is more about unity than sport right now."
