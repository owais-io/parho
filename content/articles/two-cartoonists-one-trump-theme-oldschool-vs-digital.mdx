title: "Two Cartoonists, One Trump Theme: Old‑School vs Digital"
summary: "Two seasoned cartoonists, Martin Rowson and Ella Baron, were asked to draw the same Trump‑and‑chaos theme in one day. Rowson uses pencils, pens and watercolours, loving the messy, tactile feel. Baron works on a tablet with a stylus, tightening lines and focusing on precision. They compare techniques, share what they admire about each other, and discuss how their styles shape political satire."
