title: "Could a 1911 law force the Lords to accept the assisted‑death bill?"
summary: "Supporters of assisted‑death want to use a 1911 law, called the Parliament Act, to push their bill through if the Lords keep blocking it. The Act lets the Commons ignore the Lords after a year of delay, a move used only seven times before, mainly for controversial laws. If the assisted‑death bill stalls this session, its backers could re‑introduce it next year or try to force debate, but success is uncertain."
