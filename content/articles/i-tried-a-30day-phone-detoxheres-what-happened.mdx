title: "I Tried a 30‑Day Phone Detox—Here’s What Happened"
summary: "I gave up my iPhone for a month, swapping it for a cheap Nokia, a Walkman and a film camera. I tried to live without social media, scrolling and constant notifications. The experiment showed that while I struggled at first—missed messages, trouble paying rent, and feeling a bit lonely—I also felt calmer, more present, and less stressed. It made me think about cutting back on digital distractions for good."
