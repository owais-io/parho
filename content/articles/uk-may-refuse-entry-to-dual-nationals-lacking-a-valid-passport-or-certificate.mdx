title: "UK may refuse entry to dual nationals lacking a valid passport or certificate"
summary: "The UK Home Office will start checking all passengers for entry permission from February 25. Dual nationals must show a British passport or a certificate of entitlement. There is no grace period and the rule was poorly communicated, leaving many unaware. Some have already cancelled trips, and the £589 certificate takes weeks to get and is far costlier than the £16 electronic travel authorisation. Carriers may accept expired passports, but the process remains confusing."
