title: "Australian children in Syria need help to get home"
summary: "A group of 11 Australian women and their 23 children were stuck in a camp in north‑east Syria. The Albanese government says they will not send anyone back, but the opposition wants to know what aid has been offered and is pushing laws that would stop private help. International rules say children have a right to return safely, so the government may have to act soon."
