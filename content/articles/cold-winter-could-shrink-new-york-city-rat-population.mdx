title: "Cold Winter Could Shrink New York City Rat Population"
summary: "A severe winter in New York may cut the city’s rat numbers, scientists say. Cold weather stops the rodents’ breeding, so fewer pups survive to spring. The sanitation department reports a steady drop in sightings after a citywide trash‑containment push. While rats still roam tunnels and basements, the effort is starting to pay off—though rat tours of “rat‑infested” streets still go on."
