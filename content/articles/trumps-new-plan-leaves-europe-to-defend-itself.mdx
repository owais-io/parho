title: "Trump’s New Plan Leaves Europe to Defend Itself"
summary: "Trump’s new strategy says the U.S. will pull back its troops from Europe and focus on the Americas and China. That means Europe must step up its own defense, boost spending, and be ready to resist U.S. pressure on trade and politics. The move could leave Europe caught between a retreating ally and a rising rival, so Brussels needs to act quickly to avoid being pushed aside."
