title: "Cold Europe Drives More Migrant Birds to the UK"
summary: "A recent cold snap across Europe is sending more fieldfares, redwings and other species to the UK for winter. The RSPB says the warmer UK winters offer food, shelter and water, so we’re likely to see surprise visitors in gardens during the Big Garden Birdwatch. The event, which drew almost 600,000 people last year, helps people count and share bird sightings. This winter’s numbers could be a record high."
