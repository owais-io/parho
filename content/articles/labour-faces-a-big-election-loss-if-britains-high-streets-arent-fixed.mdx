title: "Labour faces a big election loss if Britain’s high streets aren’t fixed"
summary: "A new study warns that Labour could lose the next general election unless it tackles the decline of high streets. Voters say empty shops, shoplifting and the loss of local brands hurt community pride more than any other issue. While online shopping rises, new businesses like pubs, gyms and vape shops are taking over. The government plans a £5 bn regeneration scheme, and Labour is pushing measures to let communities take back empty shops."
