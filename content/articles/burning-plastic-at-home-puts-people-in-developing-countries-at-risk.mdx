title: "Burning Plastic at Home Puts People in Developing Countries at Risk"
summary: "A new study of more than 1,000 people in 26 countries found that many households burn plastic for cooking and heating. About one‑third know others do it, and some even admit they’ve burned plastic themselves. Lack of clean fuels and poor waste services forces families to burn bags, bottles and wrappers, releasing toxic gases that can harm lungs and contaminate food. Experts say governments must improve waste collection, provide clean‑fuel subsidies, and warn people about the danger."
