title: "UK asylum system is chaotic and splits communities, says home secretary"
summary: "Shabana Mahmood, the UK home secretary, says the asylum system is out of control and hurts communities. She plans to cut permanent status for refugees, making them reapply every two‑and‑a‑half years and possibly send them back when their home country is safe, like Denmark’s rules. Illegal arrivals would need to wait 20 years before permanent rights, and housing help could become optional. Critics warn the changes could uproot families and damage the country’s future."
