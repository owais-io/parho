title: "Tim Wilson Calls for the RBA to Tighten Inflation Control"
summary: "Tim Wilson, the new shadow treasurer, has warned that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been too soft on inflation and should tighten policy even if it hurts jobs. He wants the RBA to rethink its dual goal of low inflation and full employment.
