title: "EU Parliament Wants to Ban Social Media for Kids Under 16"
summary: "The EU’s parliament voted by a large majority that children under 16 should not use social media unless their parents agree. The move follows Australia’s upcoming ban and worries about kids’ mental health and addictive app features. Parents could allow use from age 13, but the default would block things like endless scrolling and auto‑play videos for minors. The vote is a push for new EU rules, despite some opposition from member states."
