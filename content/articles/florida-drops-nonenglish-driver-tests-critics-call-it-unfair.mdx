title: "Florida drops non‑English driver tests, critics call it unfair"
summary: "Florida has changed its driver‑license rules so that all tests must be taken in English, removing Spanish, Haitian Creole, and Portuguese versions. The move has angered immigrant groups and the ACLU, who say it will make it hard for people who don’t speak English to get a license and get to work or doctor appointments. The state says the change won’t hurt safety, but critics point to transportation gaps and unequal treatment."
