title: "Democrats claim Justice Department is hiding half of Epstein files"
summary: "After the Justice Department said it finished reviewing Epstein files, Democrats say the agency is still hiding documents. They want the full 6 million pages, but only about 3 million were released. The public share includes names of Trump, Clinton and Prince Andrew, though many names were redacted. Victims’ lawyers say the redactions hurt them, and the department has now pulled some pages. Republicans and Democrats are still at odds over the dispute."
