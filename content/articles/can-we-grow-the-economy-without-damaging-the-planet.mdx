title: "Can We Grow the Economy Without Damaging the Planet?"
summary: "Economists and the UN say the idea that richer economies can grow while protecting the planet is wrong. New research shows that while some countries have cut their own emissions, the total carbon in the air is still rising. A movement called post‑growth argues we must stop measuring success by GDP and focus on people’s wellbeing and the planet’s limits. Some believe technology can fix it, but many think we need to shrink the economy or change what we value."
