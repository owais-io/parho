title: "Why David Lammy Says Britain Needs Fewer Juries"
summary: "Juries in Britain are old‑fashioned and slow, causing huge court backlogs and many people to wait years for a trial. David Lammy wants to keep juries only for the most serious crimes, letting most cases be decided by a judge alone. A review says the system could collapse if it stays the same. Other countries use judges, not juries, and have lower prison rates. The article argues the UK must modernise its courts."
