title: "Wyoming Supreme Court Says Two Strict Abortion Bans Are Unconstitutional"
summary: "The Wyoming Supreme Court found two very restrictive abortion laws unconstitutional, keeping abortion legal in the state. The decision overturned a ban that would have made Wyoming the only state to outlaw abortion pills. The court said the laws violate a 2012 state constitutional amendment that protects adults' right to make health choices. The ruling was a win for the lone state abortion clinic, though the governor wants a constitutional amendment to reverse it. Meanwhile, other states are eyeing changes."
