title: "Trump Issues Order to Speed Up Rebuilding After LA Wildfires"
summary: "President Trump signed an executive order to cut red‑tapey delays so people can rebuild homes destroyed by the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires. The order tells FEMA and the SBA to create rules that let builders self‑certify safety standards and to pull back state and local permitting barriers. Critics say the real problems are money, insurance payouts and slow funding, and they want more federal help, not just faster paperwork. The order also forces an audit of California’s disaster‑recovery money."
