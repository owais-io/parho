title: "Spin bowling missing from Ashes series"
summary: "England’s Ashes win felt unsatisfying because the series lacked good spin bowling. Australia’s main spinner Nathan Lyon was injured and didn’t bowl many overs, while England’s leading spinner, Shoaib Bashir, struggled and played little. Other spin options like Will Jacks and Todd Murphy have had limited chances. With few spinners working well, the games looked more like fast‑bowling battles, leaving fans disappointed."
