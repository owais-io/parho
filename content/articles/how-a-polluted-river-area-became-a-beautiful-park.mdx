title: "How a Polluted River Area Became a Beautiful Park"
summary: "Years ago, the area by the River Goyt in New Mills was filled with sewage, a dump, and toxic gasworks. The river was dead. Then Sir Martin Doughty and the council planted 22,000 trees, including 500 oaks from local school kids, and turned straight lines into real woodland. Over 30 years it healed into a park, walking trail and tourist spot. The real comeback is driven by tiny microbes and the whole ecosystem."
