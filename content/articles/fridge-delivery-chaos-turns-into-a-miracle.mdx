title: "Fridge Delivery Chaos Turns Into a Miracle"
summary: "The author tried to get a new fridge installed in a granny flat that could only be accessed by a narrow stairway. Delivery teams kept arriving with the wrong size, then the correct size but the old fridge was still too big to take down. After several back‑and‑forth calls, cancellations, and a week of frustration, a final crew finally removed the old fridge and installed the new one. Family members joked about the ordeal, and the author finally laughed at the absurdity of it all."
