title: "UN says Gaza is no longer in famine, but hunger remains a crisis"
summary: "The UN says Gaza is no longer in famine thanks to more aid, but hunger is still a crisis. About 12% of people still lack enough food, and winter rains have made it worse. Most live in tents because houses were destroyed. Israel has let some aid in after a ceasefire, but delivery is still spotty. If the truce breaks, famine could return. Aid groups say Israel blocks supplies, and disease risks are high."
