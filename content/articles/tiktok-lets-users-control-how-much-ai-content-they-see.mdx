title: "TikTok Lets Users Control How Much AI Content They See"
summary: "TikTok is testing a new setting that lets users pick how many AI‑made videos appear in their feed. The app has over 1 billion AI videos, but most uploads are from people. Users can go to “Manage topic” and turn AI content up or down, just like filters for news or fashion. TikTok will add watermarks to AI videos and fund AI‑education projects. The company will keep human moderators for safety while using AI to filter harmful posts."
