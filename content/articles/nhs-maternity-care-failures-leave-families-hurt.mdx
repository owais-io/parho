title: "NHS maternity care failures leave families hurt"
summary: "Lady Amos is leading a national investigation into NHS maternity care after 748 problems were found in the past decade. She says women are often ignored, misinformed, and treated unfairly, especially those from minority or lower‑income backgrounds. Families report babies dying, being put in the wrong wards, and staff lacking empathy, making mothers feel blamed. The findings will be published in 2026 and a new taskforce will work to fix these issues."
