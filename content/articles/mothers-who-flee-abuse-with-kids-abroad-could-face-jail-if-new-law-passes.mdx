title: "Mothers who flee abuse with kids abroad could face jail if new law passes"
summary: "New law could criminalise mothers who take children overseas to escape abuse. If passed, parents who keep kids abroad without the other parent’s permission would break the law, facing up to seven years in prison. Fathers’ rights groups back the change, but critics argue it puts children at risk and ignores abuse. Most cross‑border cases involve mothers fleeing domestic violence, and many are currently treated as civil matters, not crimes."
