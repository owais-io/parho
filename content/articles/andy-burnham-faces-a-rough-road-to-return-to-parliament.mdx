title: "Andy Burnham Faces a Rough Road to Return to Parliament"
summary: "Andy Burnham wants to become Labour leader again, but getting back into Parliament is tricky. He’d have to quit his mayor job, then face the Labour National Executive Committee, where many members dislike him. New rules could block his candidacy before he even reaches the selection panel. Even if he wins the seat in Gorton and Denton, the vote could be tough and he could lose. The road is hard."
