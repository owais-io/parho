title: "New flu strain is overloading European hospitals, WHO says"
summary: "WHO says a new flu strain is straining hospitals across Europe. In 27 of 38 countries, flu activity is high, with the new A(H3N2) variant making up most cases. The season started early, and while the strain isn’t more deadly, hospitals are busy. Vaccination helps, especially for the elderly, pregnant women, kids and health workers. The peak is expected in late December/early January, and governments urge people to get jabbed and follow safety rules."
