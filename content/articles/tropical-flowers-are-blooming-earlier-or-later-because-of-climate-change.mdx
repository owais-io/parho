title: "Tropical Flowers Are Blooming Earlier or Later Because of Climate Change"
summary: "A study of 8,000 tropical plant samples collected over the past 200 years shows that flowers are now blooming earlier or later than before. On average, the timing changes by about two days each decade. For example, a Brazilian tree flowers 80 days later than in the 1950s, while a Ghanaian shrub started blooming 17 days earlier. These shifts upset the timing of pollinators, fruit‑eating animals and other plants, threatening the whole ecosystem and biodiversity."
