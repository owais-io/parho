Egan, a former Labour member who was expelled in 2022 for sharing left‑wing social media posts, beat the sitting boss who had worked closely with Prime Minister Starmer. Her win could lead Unison to cut or withdraw its large donations to Labour and reassess its alliance. Egan said she will use the union to fight for workers and review ties to the party."
