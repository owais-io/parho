title: "Nigeria’s Security Crisis: How Marginalizing Minorities Fuels Violence"
summary: "Nigeria’s security crisis is a mix of religious fights, violent attacks on schools, and a clash between herders and farmers. Christians, Muslims, and other minorities feel pushed aside while the government focuses on keeping the regime safe. A weak police system, little data, and powerful armed groups make it hard to stop the violence. International attention may push the government to act, but the problem is too complex for a quick fix."
