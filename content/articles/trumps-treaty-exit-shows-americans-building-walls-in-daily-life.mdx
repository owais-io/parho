title: "Trump’s treaty exit shows Americans building walls in daily life"
summary: "The article explains that Trump’s decision to leave 66 international agreements—like climate and migration treaties—shows a broader trend in America of building literal and figurative walls. The author, a professor of anthropology, talks about how homes, cars, and media are designed to keep people separate. He says this isolation makes it harder to care about global problems such as climate change or clean water. He urges people to remember that we’re all connected and need to work together."
