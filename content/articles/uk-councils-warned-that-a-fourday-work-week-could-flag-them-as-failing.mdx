title: "UK councils warned that a four‑day work week could flag them as failing"
summary: "The government has warned local councils that moving to a four‑day week might make them look like failing authorities. A letter from the local government secretary, Steve Reed, says “staff working part‑time for full pay” is a red flag. Twenty‑five councils are debating the idea, and one in Cambridgeshire has already tried it. Reed said the policy hurt that council’s performance. Pro‑four‑day‑week groups say it can boost productivity, but the government remains cautious."
