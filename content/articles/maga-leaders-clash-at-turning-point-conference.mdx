title: "MAGA Leaders Clash at Turning Point Conference"
summary: "The Turning Point USA conference in Phoenix brought together top right‑wing figures like Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson, Ben Shapiro, Steve Bannon and others for a four‑day event. But the meeting turned into a battleground, with Shapiro calling out Carlson for giving a platform to white nationalist Nick Fuentes, and leaders disagreeing about how far the movement should go and whether it should reject extremist voices. The loss of Charlie Kirk’s leadership is seen as a reason the group is splintering."
