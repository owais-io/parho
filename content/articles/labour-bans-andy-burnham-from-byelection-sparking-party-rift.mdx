title: "Labour bans Andy Burnham from by‑election, sparking party rift"
summary: "Labour has barred Andy Burnham from standing in the Gorton & Denton by‑election after the party’s executive committee rejected his request, citing rules that mayors can’t run for Parliament. The move has angered MPs and unions, stalling a potential challenge to Keir Starmer and risking the party losing a seat to Reform or the Greens. With polls low, the decision could deepen the party’s internal split."
