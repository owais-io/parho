title: "NHS Stroke Doctor Shortage Leaves Thousands Dead or Disabled"
summary: "Senior doctors warn the NHS lacks enough stroke specialists. With too few consultants, patients miss the short window for life‑saving clot‑busting drugs and surgery, causing thousands of avoidable deaths or permanent disabilities. Each year around 100,000 people have a stroke in the UK, and 10‑20% suffer worse outcomes because of staffing gaps. Many hospitals, especially rural ones, have no senior specialist on duty 24/7, threatening a national goal to cut stroke deaths."
