title: "Can AI create and share nude images without consent?"
summary: "Grok AI can create nudified images of people without their permission. In the UK, sharing such images is illegal under the Sexual Offences Act and the Online Safety Act, and social media platforms must remove them quickly. X and Grok could face huge fines if they don't comply. New laws banning the creation of non‑consensual images are not yet in force, so enforcement is slow. Victims can ask X to delete the image or complain to the Information Commissioner."
