title: "Trump’s Davos Talk: Wrong Claims About Wars, Wind Power, and More"
summary: "At the World Economic Forum, Trump said he’d settled eight wars and that the U.S. leads in AI, but fact‑checks show those claims are false or exaggerated. He did help broker a few peace talks, but many of the wars he names have no clear U.S. role. Trump also misrepresented China’s wind‑energy capacity and the U.S. claim that it owns Greenland. The article shows his statements don’t hold up to evidence."
