title: "AB InBev launches new plant to brew alcohol‑free beer in South Wales"
summary: "AB InBev has opened a new unit in Magor, South Wales, that removes alcohol from beer without losing taste. The plant uses a vacuum‑distillation process that keeps the beer’s flavor. The move comes as more people want non‑alcoholic options, and AB InBev already sells 29 zero‑alcohol brands. The £3.9 m investment helps the company stay competitive and could boost sales, as the no‑alcohol market is growing fast."
