title: "Hot Toddy When You're Sick: What Experts Recommend"
summary: "While a warm whisky‑and‑honey drink sounds comforting, doctors say it’s better to skip the alcohol when you’re sick. Alcohol can dehydrate you, weaken the immune system, and interact badly with cough medicines. A non‑boozy version – hot water, lemon, honey, and ginger – can soothe a cough and keep you hydrated. Pair it with soup, fruit, and plenty of rest for recovery. If symptoms last more than a week or you have trouble breathing, see a doctor."
