title: "I have a mild skin cancer, but the news got blown out of proportion"
summary: "Adrian Chiles, a TV presenter, wrote that he has a mild skin cancer, but the story was sensationalized by the press. He said the NHS system is very digital and not very personal, so he didn’t tell many people. Yet the media headlines made him feel embarrassed, then annoyed because people kept offering prayers. He ultimately felt grateful for the outpouring of support and wishes everyone a happy Christmas."
