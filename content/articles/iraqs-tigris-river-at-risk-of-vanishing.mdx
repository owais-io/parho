title: "Iraq’s Tigris River at Risk of Vanishing"
summary: "The Tigris River, vital for Iraq’s 18 million people and for the Mandaean community’s religious rituals, is shrinking and getting polluted. Years of war, weak sewage systems, and factories have dumped waste into it, while dams in Turkey and Iran cut its flow by a third. Drought and overuse mean less water and more pollution. New deals with Turkey have sparked criticism, and without action the river could disappear, endangering lives and faith."
