title: "Australian House Prices to Rise 5% in 2026 After Big Jump in 2025"
summary: "Australia’s house prices are set to climb again in 2026, rising at least 5% after an 8.6% jump in 2025. Prices rose in every capital last year, especially Darwin, Perth and Brisbane, while Sydney grew only 5.8%. Housing supply is still tight and banks expect higher interest rates, which may slow growth a bit. The rise makes buying a home tougher, especially for young Aussies."
