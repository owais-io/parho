title: "Mangione’s Defense Seeks to Keep Backpack Evidence Out of Trial"
summary: "In a high‑profile murder case, Luigi Mangione’s lawyers are trying to keep the items police found in his backpack out of the courtroom. They say the search was illegal because the bag was moved before he was handcuffed and that the police had no good reason to look inside. If the judge rules the items can’t be used, the prosecution could lose the gun and other key evidence, though other evidence remains strong."
