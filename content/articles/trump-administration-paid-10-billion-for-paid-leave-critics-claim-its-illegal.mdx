title: "Trump Administration Paid $10 Billion for Paid Leave, Critics Claim It’s Illegal"
summary: "A new report says the Trump administration paid about $10 billion for paid leave in 2025, putting over 154,000 federal workers home for no work. Critics argue the program broke the Administrative Leave Act, which limits paid leave to 10 days a year. Because rules were never fully made, the program slipped through. Lawmakers and watchdogs say the money should have gone to hiring more staff, not paying people to stay off the job."
