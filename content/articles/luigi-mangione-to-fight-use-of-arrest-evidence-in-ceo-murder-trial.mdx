title: "Luigi Mangione to Fight Use of Arrest Evidence in CEO Murder Trial"
summary: "Luigi Mangione will go to court this week to argue that police cannot use evidence from his December arrest in the killing of United HealthCare executive Brian Thompson. After a judge tossed out two top charges, Mangione still faces nine counts, including second‑degree murder. His lawyers claim the cops didn’t inform him of his rights and searched his bag without a warrant, so they want that evidence excluded."
