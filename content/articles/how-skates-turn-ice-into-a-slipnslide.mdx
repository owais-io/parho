title: "How Skates Turn Ice into a Slip‑N‑Slide"
summary: "Skates have a surprisingly clever trick: they make a thin layer of water slide under the blade, even when the ice is frozen. The blade’s shape and a little friction heat melt the ice just enough to let you glide. The ice itself already has a slippery “quasi‑liquid” surface, so skates only need to tap into that. That’s why even a simple iron blade can make skating possible."
