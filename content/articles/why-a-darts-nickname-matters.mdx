title: "Why a Darts Nickname Matters"
summary: "Nicknames in darts aren’t just fun—they’re part of a player’s brand. In a 2017 match, two up‑and‑coming players fought over “Cool Hand” vs. “Cool Man”; the winner kept the nickname. Some names are chosen on the spot, others come from agents or fans. Broadcasters can even suggest names, but if a nickname is too offensive the PDC can forbid it. A good name can boost a player’s image and sales."
