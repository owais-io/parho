title: "Boebert says Trump vetoed Colorado water bill as political payback"
summary: "Representative Lauren Boebert fired at former President Donald Trump after he vetoed a bill that would have put money into a safe‑water project for 39 rural Colorado communities. The bill had passed Congress without opposition, but Trump said he was blocking “expensive, unreliable” spending. Boebert says the veto is retaliation for her criticism of Trump’s allies and his refusal to release certain government files. The move follows a similar veto of a Florida water‑protection project."
