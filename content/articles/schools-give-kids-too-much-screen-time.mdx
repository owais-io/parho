title: "Schools Give Kids Too Much Screen Time"
summary: "Schools are full of screens. Whiteboards, tablets, and online homework fill most days. Even playtime often turns to YouTube videos. This constant exposure may hurt kids’ learning, language, and social skills. A social‑media ban for under‑16s doesn’t fix the problem because the classroom itself is a screen‑heavy environment. Parents can limit home use, but schools need clear limits and more face‑to‑face time. Children deserve learning that focuses on people, play, and real‑world exploration."
