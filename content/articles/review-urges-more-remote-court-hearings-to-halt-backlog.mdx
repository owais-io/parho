title: "Review urges more remote court hearings to halt backlog"
summary: "Sir Brian Leveson's latest review of England and Wales' courts recommends adding more remote hearings to cut the backlog. It contains over 130 suggestions, including a new criminal‑justice adviser role for the Prime Minister and moving first‑stage and witness‑only hearings online. Trials would stay in person, but remote options for sentencing and police witnesses are suggested. The review urges quick action, though some experts warn it could affect fairness."
