title: "Chile elects ultra‑conservative José Antonio Kast as new president"
summary: "José Antonio Kast, a hard‑right former congressman, won Chile’s presidential race with 58% of the vote. His campaign focused on cutting crime and forcing undocumented migrants—mainly Venezuelans—to leave. Kast said he would build fences, detention centers, and boost the military at the border. He won against leftist Jeannette Jara, but he won’t have an absolute majority in Congress. Chile will now see a shift toward stricter security and immigration policies."
