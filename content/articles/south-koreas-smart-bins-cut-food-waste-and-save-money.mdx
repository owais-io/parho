title: "South Korea’s smart bins cut food waste and save money"
summary: "South Korea uses smart RFID bins in Seoul apartments to weigh food waste and show the cost on a screen. Residents pay a few won per kilogram, so they’re more careful. The system has cut the city’s food waste by almost a quarter, and in some buildings by more than half. The waste is shredded, dried, turned into feed, compost or biogas. The programme started in the 1990s and now covers most apartment blocks, with rewards on the way."
