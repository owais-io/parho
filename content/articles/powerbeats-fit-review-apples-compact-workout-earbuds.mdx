title: "Powerbeats Fit Review: Apple’s Compact Workout Earbuds"
summary: "Apple’s new Powerbeats Fit earbuds are a slimmer, more comfortable version of the 2022 Beats Fit Pro. They have a flexible silicone wing that fits inside the ear, giving a tighter, less noticeable fit, especially good for glasses wearers. Battery lasts six hours with noise‑cancelling, 24 hours with the case. They work well on iPhone and Android, have decent sound, active noise‑cancelling and good call quality, but are pricey."
