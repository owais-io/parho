title: "Is the New Nations Rugby Championship Worth It?"
summary: "The idea is to let 12 national rugby teams play a series of matches each year and finish with a finals weekend in London. Supporters say it could boost TV audiences and give the sport a clearer schedule. But critics point out problems: the team lineup is odd (e.g., Wales vs. Georgia), promotion rules are unclear, travel plans are confusing, and extra games might hurt player health and dilute the World Cup’s importance. Many experts remain doubtful."
