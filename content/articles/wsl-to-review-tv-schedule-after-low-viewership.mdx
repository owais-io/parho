title: "WSL to review TV schedule after low viewership"
summary: "WSL is looking at when to show games after this season because viewership was lower than hoped. Saturday lunch matches drew only about 60,000 viewers, less than a month earlier. Fans say the timing hurts attendance. The league will meet with Sky and BBC to decide if matches should move to Friday evenings or other slots. Saturday and Sunday noon times clash with other football, so the schedule might change next year."
