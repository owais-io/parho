title: "Labour’s tough year: Leaders must face hard choices"
summary: "Labour’s leader, Sir Keir Starmer, faces problems. Britain needs a clear plan and a majority to stay stable, but Starmer hasn’t convinced voters. Economic problems like low wages and a high cost of living make people unhappy. The government keeps cutting one department to help another, creating resentment and giving space to demagogues. The 2024 budget tried to avoid tough choices, but that only made the problems worse. MPs may soon want new leadership that tackles these hard decisions honestly."
