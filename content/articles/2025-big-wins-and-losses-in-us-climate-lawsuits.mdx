title: "2025: Big Wins and Losses in US Climate Lawsuits"
summary: "2025 saw many lawsuits against big oil over climate claims. Courts largely refused to drop the cases, even after Trump and oil lobbyists pushed for a shield. New types of suits emerged, like a wrongful‑death claim and a class action on rising insurance costs. Hawaii joined the list of states suing oil. While some cases were dismissed, the trend is growing, and 2026 may bring even more suits on plastic pollution and extreme weather."
