title: "Civil service pension still owed five months after retirement"
summary: "I retired from the civil service five months ago and still haven’t gotten my pension. My complaints to the Civil Service Pension Scheme (MyCSP) are ignored. The Pensions Ombudsman says I need proof that they didn’t reply. MyCSP faced criticism for many delays after a rise in complaints. The back‑dated pension of £21,300 was finally paid just six days after I followed up. The issue shows poor service and communication problems."
