title: "Oldham failed to protect its grooming‑victims"
summary: "In the early 2000s, girls in Oldham’s care homes and schools were repeatedly abducted and abused by men, including a man named Shakil Chowdhury. A police‑social‑work taskforce called Operation Messenger was meant to stop this but was criticised for weak casework and ignoring victims’ pleas. In 2025, Elon Musk’s call for action triggered a national inquiry into grooming gangs, forcing the UK to examine how Oldham’s failures and racial fears let thousands of children suffer."
