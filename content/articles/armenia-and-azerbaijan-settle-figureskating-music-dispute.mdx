title: "Armenia and Azerbaijan settle figure‑skating music dispute"
summary: "An Armenian pair’s short‑program music, titled “Artsakh,” sparked a political row when Azerbaijan’s Olympic committee complained that the name was a territorial claim. The International Skating Union reviewed the issue and changed the official listing to simply “Music by Ara Gevorgyan,” removing the political wording. The resolution means the skaters can compete as planned, and it shows how political tensions can still surface at the Games."
