title: "Tanzania’s shift to authoritarian rule signals Africa’s democracy in danger"
summary: "Africa was once seen as a fast‑growing continent with big hopes for a bright future. But a new report shows that politics and security are slipping back. Tanzania is a case in point. In 2025 its election was marred by arrests, internet shutdowns, and violent protests that left many dead and activists missing. The country’s shift to authoritarian rule is a warning that the continent’s gains can disappear if democracy weakens."
