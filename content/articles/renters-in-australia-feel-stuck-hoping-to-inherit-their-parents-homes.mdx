title: "Renters in Australia feel stuck, hoping to inherit their parents' homes"
summary: "In Sydney, rents have climbed to over $800 a week, more than half of the median income. House prices have jumped nearly 50% in five years, making buying a home almost impossible for many. Young Australians find themselves moving every few years, paying rising rents, and dreaming that one day they’ll inherit a family home. The problem, the writer says, is not just between generations but a broader political and cultural system that turns housing into a luxury asset rather than a basic right."
