title: "Anglo American Cancels CEO Bonuses Over Merger Pushback"
summary: "Anglo American has scrapped a plan that would have given its CEO and other top managers huge bonuses if a $50bn merger with Canadian miner Teck went through. Investors and watchdogs said the payouts were too big and linked too closely to the deal. The company said it would talk more with shareholders about pay before next year’s AGM. The merger still needs approval, and if it passes it would create one of the world’s biggest copper producers."
