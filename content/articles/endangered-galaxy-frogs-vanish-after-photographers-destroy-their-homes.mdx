title: "Endangered Galaxy Frogs Vanish After Photographers Destroy Their Homes"
summary: "A rare species of tiny frogs called galaxy frogs in Kerala’s rainforests have gone missing after photographers entered their area to take pictures. The frogs live under logs and are very delicate. Reporters were seen breaking logs and moving frogs around for better shots, sometimes handling them too long, which killed a few. Even after searches, no frogs were found. Experts are calling for stricter rules to protect the frogs and their homes."
