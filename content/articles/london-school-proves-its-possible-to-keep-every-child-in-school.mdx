title: "London school proves it’s possible to keep every child in school"
summary: "TCES Nurture primary in East London has never sent a child out of school in 25 years. It keeps students in small classes where therapy is part of everyday lessons, not a separate activity. The school’s core rules are: never exclude, give every child a trusted adult, and work closely with families. Parents say their kids feel safer and more confident, and the model is expanding to a second school."
