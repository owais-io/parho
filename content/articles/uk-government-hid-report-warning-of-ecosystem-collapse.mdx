title: "UK government hid report warning of ecosystem collapse"
summary: "A UK national security report that warned ecosystems were collapsing was suppressed by the government. The document, released only after a freedom‑of‑information request, says losing habitats could threaten food security, trigger wars, and destabilise the economy. The report was cut short and some scary warnings, like tensions over Himalayan glaciers, were omitted. The government said it would not invest in needed protection programs, making the threat worse."
