title: "COP30: Why Some Say the Climate Summit Is Broken"
summary: "A big climate meeting, COP30, is being held in hot Belém, Brazil. Many people hoped it would be a turning point, but critics say the talks just let lobbyists dominate and leave poor countries behind. Fossil‑fuel companies send thousands of people, far more than many vulnerable nations. The COP has helped set goals, but it’s slow and uneven, and emissions keep rising. The summit may repeat past failures."
