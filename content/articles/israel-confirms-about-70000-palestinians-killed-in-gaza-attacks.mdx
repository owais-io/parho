title: "Israel Confirms About 70,000 Palestinians Killed in Gaza Attacks"
summary: "Israel has finally said that around 70,000 Palestinians were killed by its strikes in Gaza, a first since the war began. After years of dismissing Gaza health data, officials now say the numbers are broadly accurate. This change may lead to more scrutiny over civilian deaths and question Israel’s earlier claims. It also comes as the Rafah border crossing with Egypt will open for the first time in years."
