title: "Ramadan: I’m a Muslim Briton, Not a Stereotype"
summary: "Ramadan is a month of fasting and charity, but many Muslims in Britain also face hate. Nazir Afzal, a university chancellor and former prosecutor, says he’s often called “the Muslim” in his work, even when it doesn’t matter. He points out that bigotry makes every Muslim a target, while most of us contribute to society. He stresses that issues like grooming gangs or FGM aren’t rooted in Islam and that Muslims are a diverse group, not a single stereotype."
