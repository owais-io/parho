title: "Church of England’s Same‑Sex Marriage Debate Timeline"
summary: "From 1979 to 2024, the Church of England has wrestled with same‑sex marriage. Early reports and motions in the 1980s and 1990s kept the debate quiet. In 2002 Canada offered blessings, and 2005 England’s civil partnership forced clergy to stay celibate. 2014 same‑sex marriage became legal, but bishops banned clergy blessings. In 2023 the synod allowed trial blessings, and in July 2024 it lifted limits on standalone services, sparking a split."
