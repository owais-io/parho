title: "Why UK residents don’t realize they’re at flood risk and what can change that"
summary: "Even though the UK publishes detailed flood maps and runs public campaigns, less than half of people in flood‑prone areas know they’re at risk, and only a handful realise their own property could be damaged. The letter argues that flood planning is too top‑down, leaving locals out of decision‑making. It calls for more local flood officers, devolving power to local councils, and mixing engineering, nature‑based fixes and community action to build real resilience."
