title: "Labour MPs worry about rising electricity costs hurting industry"
summary: "The chief executive of Centrica said UK electricity prices will be higher in 2030 than in 2022, after Russia’s war in Ukraine. That means businesses will pay more for power and could slow growth. The government has cut its promise of £300 lower bills, giving £150 to taxes instead. Only a few companies get big discounts now, and new support plans are still vague. Industry groups warn that high costs could push factories out of the UK."
