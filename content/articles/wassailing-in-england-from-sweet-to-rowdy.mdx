title: "Wassailing in England: From Sweet to Rowdy"
summary: "In the West Country of England, people celebrate wassailing – singing and cider to thank apple trees – in very different ways. The village of Wiveliscombe hosts a gentle, child‑friendly event. A nearby cider factory runs a large, ticketed gathering. The rowdier festival in Wellington includes Morris dancing, a dragon and a local legend. All aim to thank trees for last year’s harvest, showing how the same custom can be playful, organised or wild."
