title: "Starmer warns doctors against striking amid flu crisis"
summary: "Keir Starmer has warned junior doctors that striking next week would be irresponsible as the NHS faces a worst‑case flu surge. The government offered more training places and a pay rise, but doctors say it falls short of the pay increase they want. The British Medical Association is polling its members; if a majority backs the offer, the five‑day strike could be cancelled."
