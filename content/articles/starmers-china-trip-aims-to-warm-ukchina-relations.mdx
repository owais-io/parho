title: "Starmer’s China Trip Aims to Warm UK‑China Relations"
summary: "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer flew to China this week in hopes of easing the strained relationship that had cooled since 2018. Despite worries about spies and privacy, he secured a visa‑waiver, cuts to whisky duties and a deal with six British MPs who were under Chinese sanctions. He also pushed for human‑rights discussions, but it’s unclear if that will change anything. The trip marks the start of a more careful partnership, but the UK still faces domestic politics."
