title: "Church of England Halts LGBTQ+ Equality Work"
summary: "The Church of England’s main governing body, the General Synod, voted to stop its three‑year project that aimed to let clergy bless same‑sex couples and support LGBTQ+ people. The motion, carried 252‑132, puts the plan on hold and keeps the ban on civil same‑sex marriages for clergy. The decision reflects deep split between conservative and liberal members, and many feel hurt and abandoned, hoping future elections or new groups might revive the cause."
