title: "UK Home Prices Drop in December, Nationwide Reports"
summary: "Nationwide says UK house prices fell 0.4% in December, ending the year with the slowest growth in over 18 months. Prices hit about £271,000, lower than forecast. The dip is blamed on the budget's timing and still‑high mortgage rates. Despite the drop, affordability is the best since 2015 and first‑time buyers are buying a larger share of homes. The Bank of England cut rates to 3.75%, giving hope for a rebound. Experts say lower rates and clearer policy could lift the market next year."
