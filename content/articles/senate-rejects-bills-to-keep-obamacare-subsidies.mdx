title: "Senate Rejects Bills to Keep Obamacare Subsidies"
summary: "The U.S. Senate voted against two bills that would have kept the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) subsidies for 21.8 million people. One bill would have extended the subsidies for three years, but it got 51‑48. The other would have replaced the subsidies with money in health‑savings accounts. The Senate split, with Democrats and a few Republicans supporting the subsidy extension. The decision means many Americans could face much higher health‑insurance costs."
