title: "RBA Should Wait, Not Rush to Raise Rates"
summary: "Many investors and commentators think the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) must raise interest rates after last month’s inflation jump. But the rise was largely caused by holiday spending and the removal of electricity subsidies, not core price pressures. The RBA could get caught up in headline numbers and over‑react. Instead, it should focus on underlying inflation and hold off on a rate hike for now."
