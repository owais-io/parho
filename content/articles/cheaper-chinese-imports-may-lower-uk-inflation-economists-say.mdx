title: "Cheaper Chinese imports may lower UK inflation, economists say"
summary: "China is sending more goods to the UK after US tariffs hurt its exports. Economists say this could make products cheaper and help pull UK inflation down from 3.2% toward the 2% target by 2026. The Bank of England notes the effect will be modest but present, and the pound’s rise has already helped keep import prices steady. While cheaper goods benefit shoppers, the UK also wants to shield its steel industry."
