title: "Court Cancels Summons Against Comedian Reginald D. Hunter Over Cancellation Allegations"
summary: "The court decided not to issue a summons to comedian Reginald D. Hunter because the group Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) misled the judge. The judge said the CAA wanted to cancel Hunter, not legitimately prosecute him. He found the case abusive and cancelled it. Hunter was accused of sending offensive messages, but the CAA failed to give full information and had a history of vexatious lawsuits. The court refused to use the system for political reasons."
