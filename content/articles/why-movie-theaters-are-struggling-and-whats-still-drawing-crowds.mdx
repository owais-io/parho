title: "Why Movie Theaters Are Struggling and What’s Still Drawing Crowds"
summary: "Movie theaters are seeing a sharp drop in visitors after the pandemic. Big hits like *Wicked* still pull crowds because fans already love the story, but most new films—especially star‑powered “vanity” projects—fail to attract audiences. Studios are betting on streaming releases, skipping theatrical runs, and losing mid‑budget movies that keep people going to the cinema. Events such as *Barbenheimer* show that special, shared experiences can still bring people into theaters, but the industry must rethink how to create more of them."
