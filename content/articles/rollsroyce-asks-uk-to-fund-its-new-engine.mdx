title: "Rolls‑Royce asks UK to fund its new engine"
summary: "Rolls‑Royce wants the UK to put up to £200m to help build its new UltraFan engine. The company says it already got big loans during COVID and now needs more cash to keep the project in Britain. It argues that other countries give even more money and that the new engine could create 40,000 jobs and boost exports. Without the subsidy, production might shift to Germany or the US, so the firm warns it could leave Britain behind."
