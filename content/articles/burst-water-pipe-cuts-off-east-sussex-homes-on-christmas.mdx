title: "Burst water pipe cuts off East Sussex homes on Christmas"
summary: "A burst water main in East Sussex cut off water for many homes on Christmas Day. The leak happened near Hastings, and low levels in the Fairlight reservoir left people with low or no pressure. Southern Water sent tankers to refill the system and opened a bottled‑water station, but customers in higher‑elevation areas were hardest hit. MPs called the company’s aging pipes a safety risk and asked for faster repairs."
