title: "London suburbs get most funding boost, critics say unfair"
summary: "Local government deal gives more money to deprived urban councils, but London suburbs see biggest gains, sparking protests from northern and rural councils who say it favors wealthier areas and leaves poorer ones worse off. The plan boosts funding for places like Manchester, Birmingham, and outer London boroughs, but cuts to other councils remain, and some will have to raise council tax above limits, while local leaders hope the extra money will help rebuild libraries and parks."
