title: "Shopping malls are turning empty stores into fun adventure spots"
summary: "Shopping centres are turning empty shop spaces into fun places. Instead of just retail, malls are adding things like zip lines, rock‑climbing walls, cricket and even wild swimming. They’re trying to make trips longer and more exciting for families and young people. Many big stores have closed, so landlords are renting the space to gyms, adventure parks and interactive gaming. The new experiences are meant to bring people back in person."
