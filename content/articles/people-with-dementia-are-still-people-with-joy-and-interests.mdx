title: "People with Dementia Are Still People with Joy and Interests"
summary: "People with dementia are not “dead” – they still feel joy and have interests. The letter shows how family reading, music, and simple activities keep their dignity. Even when a parent cannot speak, family can read aloud and watch smiles. Doctors and volunteers are encouraged to treat dementia patients as people, not objects. The story highlights the power of story, song, and empathy in care."
