title: "Oscar Piastri’s last‑minute bid for the F1 championship"
summary: "Oscar Piastri is still in the running for his first Formula One title, but the path is hard. He’s 16 points behind teammate Lando Norris and four behind Max Verstappen, and the Abu Dhabi race is the only chance. To win, Piastri would need a top‑two finish and hope both Norris and Verstappen score poorly or retire. It’s a slim, unlikely comeback but still possible."
