title: "ASOS Introduces AI Stylists to Reclaim Customers After Sales Drop"
summary: "ASOS has launched AI‑powered stylists called “Styled for You” to help shoppers pick outfits and boost sales after a 12% drop last year. The AI looks at a shopper’s past purchases and the site’s 100,000 outfits to suggest matching jackets, shoes or sweaters. The company is also speeding up design, cutting heavy discounting, and limiting returns. Despite narrowing losses, sales still fall and rivals like Shein are pulling ahead."
