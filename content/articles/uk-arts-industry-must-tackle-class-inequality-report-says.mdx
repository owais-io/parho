title: "UK arts industry must tackle class inequality, report says"
summary: "A new study from Manchester University says working‑class people are almost gone from the UK arts world. Only a few artists, musicians and writers come from ordinary backgrounds, and most top jobs go to those who went to private schools. The report urges the government to treat class like a protected group, ban unpaid internships, and give money to young creatives. It says big arts bodies are still paying lip‑service to diversity while real change is missing."
