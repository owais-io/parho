title: "Israel’s new West Bank rules fuel violence against Palestinians"
summary: "Israel has announced new rules that make it easier to take land in the West Bank and keep Palestinians from farming. The changes come as settlers are driving many Palestinians out, with over a thousand killed since October, including children. The move is seen as a step toward ending the idea of a Palestinian state, drawing condemnation from the UK and EU, while the US focuses on Gaza and Iran. The UN court says Israel must end its occupation soon."
