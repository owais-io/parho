title: "EU Approves Offshore Centres for Refugees"
summary: "EU lawmakers passed new rules that let the EU deport asylum seekers to non‑EU countries and set up offshore “return hubs.” The new list of “safe” countries – including Albania, Uganda and Tunisia – means people could be sent back to places they’ve never visited. Rights groups warn the move could send vulnerable migrants to unsafe destinations. The change is backed by right‑wing parties, reflecting the rise of nationalist MEPs in the parliament."
