title: "Teaching Kids to Say No Builds Smarter Choices"
summary: "Parents often push kids into activities they don’t want, causing frustration. Teaching kids to say no gives them permission to pause, think, and choose what matters. It helps them avoid impulsive decisions and learn why some things are worth doing. A “no” can lead to a stronger, more intentional “yes.” By valuing consent, parents help children become better thinkers and happier participants."
