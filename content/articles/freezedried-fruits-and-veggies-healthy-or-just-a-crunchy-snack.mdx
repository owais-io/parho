title: "Freeze‑Dried Fruits and Veggies: Healthy or Just a Crunchy Snack?"
summary: "Freeze‑drying removes almost all the water from fruit and veg, leaving a crunchy snack that keeps most vitamins and colours. Experts say it’s almost as nutritious as the fresh item, but the tiny pieces can pack more natural sugars and calories, so portion size matters. Flavoured varieties add oil, salt and sometimes sugar, making them more like chips than healthy veggies. They’re convenient, a bit pricey, and shouldn’t replace fresh produce."
