title: "Trump’s Tariff Threat Over Greenland Fails to Coerce Europe"
summary: "Trump tried to force Europe to hand over Greenland with a big tariff threat. Europe reacted together: France said intimidation won’t work, Denmark put it inside NATO, the EU paused a trade deal, Italy called it a mistake, and the UK warned of a downward spiral. The move shows bully tactics fail when allies stick together and the president lacks home support. It’s a reminder that trust, not threats, builds real power."
