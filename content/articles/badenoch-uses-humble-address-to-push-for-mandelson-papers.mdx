title: "Badenoch Uses Humble Address to Push for Mandelson Papers"
summary: "Kemi Badenoch, a Conservative MP, is using a rarely‑used parliamentary tool called a humble address to try to get the government to hand over papers about Peter Mandelson’s move to be Britain’s ambassador to the U.S. The motion asks for documents that show how the Cabinet Office checked Mandelson’s suitability, including emails with his staff. If the address passes, the papers would be published, though the government can keep ones that hurt national security."
