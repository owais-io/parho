title: "Thousands of Flying Foxes Die in Australian Heatwave"
summary: "Last week’s heatwave in South‑East Australia left thousands of flying foxes dead, the biggest loss since the black summer. High temperatures—over 42 °C—caused heat stress and dehydration, killing an estimated 1,000‑2,000 bats in South Australia, thousands in Victoria and up to 1,000 in New South Wales. Volunteers rescued orphan pups, but many died. Experts say the heat made it hard for bats to fly and find food, and they urge people to call wildlife groups, not try rescue themselves."
