title: "New U.S. Food Guidelines Spark Confusion, Critics Say"
summary: "The U.S. government released new dietary guidelines that many experts say are confusing and contradictory. The changes affect programs that feed millions, such as food‑stamps, school lunches and Meals on Wheels. Critics argue the new rules favor meat and full‑fat dairy, could raise saturated‑fat intake, and lack clear advice for people who don’t know how to calculate calories. They also point to industry ties in the guideline team. Supporters say the revisions reflect the latest science."
