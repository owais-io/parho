summary: "The U.S. White House says it disagrees with Israel's new rules that would let more Jewish settlers buy land and give Israel more control over parts of the West Bank. The move, approved by Israel’s security cabinet, could make a future Palestinian state smaller and hurts chances of a two‑state solution. Many countries, the UN, and the Arab League have criticized the plan. Israel’s leaders say it strengthens Israeli presence in the area."
