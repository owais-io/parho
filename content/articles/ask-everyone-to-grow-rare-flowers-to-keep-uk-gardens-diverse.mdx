title: "Ask Everyone to Grow Rare Flowers to Keep UK Gardens Diverse"
summary: "Plant Heritage says that more than half the flowers people grow in the UK aren’t sold any more, so the variety in gardens is shrinking. They are asking homeowners to plant rare or unusual species and even start “national collections” to keep them alive. The charity will show a garden at the Chelsea Flower Show to raise awareness. They also give simple cutting‑propagation tips so anyone can grow and share these special plants."
