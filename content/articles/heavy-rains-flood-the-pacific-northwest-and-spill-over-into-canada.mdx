title: "Heavy rains flood the Pacific Northwest and spill over into Canada"
summary: "Washington and Oregon just had a huge storm that dumped more than a foot of rain, swelling rivers and causing mudslides that left families trapped on rooftops. The floodwater even crossed the border, flooding parts of British Columbia and shutting major highways near Vancouver. Experts say the storms, known as atmospheric rivers, are getting stronger because of climate change. Canada is worried the U.S. hasn’t upgraded flood‑control infrastructure fast enough to protect the border region."
