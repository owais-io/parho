title: "Mistletoe: More than just Christmas kisses"
summary: "Mistletoe isn’t just a holiday decoration. It’s a parasitic plant that climbs tree branches, pulling water and nutrients through hooks while also making its own food with leaves. Though it can slow a tree’s growth, it supports many birds and insects, making it a keystone species. Removing it can lower plant diversity and drop bird numbers. The author grew mistletoe from berries she picked on an apple tree, showing how birds spread its seeds and how to propagate it."
