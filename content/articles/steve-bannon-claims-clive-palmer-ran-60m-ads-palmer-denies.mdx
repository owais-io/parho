title: "Steve Bannon claims Clive Palmer ran $60m ads, Palmer denies"
summary: "Steve Bannon allegedly said Australian billionaire Clive Palmer paid $60 million for anti‑China and climate‑change ads in the 2019 federal election. The claim came from text messages released by the U.S. Department of Justice, some of which appear to involve a former Jeffrey Epstein account. Palmer’s spokesperson quickly rejected the allegation, calling it “bullshit.” Despite the dispute, Palmer’s massive ad blitz was linked to a rise in misinformation and helped swing the vote in favour of the Coalition."
