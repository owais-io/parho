title: "Jewish Australians Must Feel Safe, but Banning Protests Won’t Help"
summary: "After the deadly Bondi shooting, many Jewish Australians feel unsafe and fear anti‑Jewish harassment. New South Wales has now given the police power to ban protests, claiming the move will protect the public and help a visiting Israeli president, Isaac Herzog. Critics argue that sweeping bans hurt free speech and can mask antisemitism. The debate centers on finding a balance between keeping communities safe and preserving the right to peaceful protest."
