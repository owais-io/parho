title: "How to Have a Low‑Carbon Holiday This Summer"
summary: "Summer is coming and many Australians want a holiday. The best way to keep travel emissions low is to stay close to home or travel by train, bus or car. Flying is still the biggest source of travel carbon and even “carbon‑offset” tickets can fall short. Instead, choose direct flights, pick airlines that run greener routes, and bring reusable items. Visiting eco‑friendly farms and local communities also reduces impact and gives a richer experience."
