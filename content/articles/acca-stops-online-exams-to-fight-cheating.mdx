title: "ACCA Stops Online Exams to Fight Cheating"
summary: "The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) will stop letting students take exams online from March, except in special cases. The decision comes after a rise in cheating, especially with AI tools that make monitoring difficult. Online exams were first introduced during COVID so students could keep studying. Similar cheating scandals have hit big firms like EY, PwC, and Deloitte. ACCA says it can’t keep up with new tech, so exams will return to in‑person or stricter supervision."
