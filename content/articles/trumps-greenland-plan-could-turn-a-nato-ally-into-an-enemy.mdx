title: "Trump’s Greenland Plan Could Turn a NATO Ally Into an Enemy"
summary: "Trump wants to take control of Greenland, a Danish territory, for “national security.” That move would upset Denmark and could bring the U.S. into a fight with a NATO ally. The article compares Trump’s threat to how the Soviet Union once forced its own allies to stay in line during the Cold War. Experts say the U.S. already has bases there, so it’s better to work with Denmark than risk a big diplomatic and military headache."
