title: "Cutting Aid Could Cause 22 Million Deaths by 2030"
summary: "A recent study says that if donor countries keep slashing development aid, up to 22 million extra deaths could happen by 2030, especially among children under five. Researchers modelled aid levels and death rates from 2002‑2021, then forecasted three future scenarios. Even a mild cut would add 9.4 million deaths, while a severe cut would add 22.6 million. Cuts in the US, UK, Germany, and others are already reducing life‑saving programs in poorer countries."
