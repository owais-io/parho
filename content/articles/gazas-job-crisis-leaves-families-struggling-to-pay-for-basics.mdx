title: "Gaza’s Job Crisis Leaves Families Struggling to Pay for Basics"
summary: "After two years of war, Gaza’s economy collapsed, leaving people like 23‑year‑old Mansour without jobs. Aid helps with food and medicine but most everyday items—fruit, clothes, phone charges—must be bought with cash. The UN says unemployment is about 80 %, and the region’s GDP has fallen to only $161 a year. With limited aid, people struggle to meet basic needs and hope for a way back to work."
