title: "Jupiter Nears Earth, Bright as Day – Watch It Tonight"
summary: "Jupiter will be at its closest to Earth in 2026, appearing in the night sky in the constellation Gemini. It's the brightest planet after Venus, easily seen with the naked eye. Its huge size and reflective clouds make it stand out. From any part of Earth, you can spot it, and even a simple pair of binoculars will reveal its four biggest moons. Small telescopes can show the planet’s cloud bands."
