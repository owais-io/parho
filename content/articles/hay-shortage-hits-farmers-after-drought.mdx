title: "Hay Shortage Hits Farmers After Drought"
summary: "Last summer’s record heat and a very dry spring left English farms with a poor hay crop. Most fields only made one thin cut, so there isn’t enough to last through the summer. Prices for small bales have doubled, and farmers are hauling hay from farther away. The story follows a local merchant and his horse, showing how the shortage is felt on the ground and the cost impact on families."
