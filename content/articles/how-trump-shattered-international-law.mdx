title: "How Trump Shattered International Law"
summary: "In 2025, Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy ripped up the rules that keep countries working together. He ignored treaties, slapped sanctions on judges who tried to hold leaders accountable, and cut funding for UN bodies. Trump treated the world’s laws like a game of chess, using the U.S. market to force other countries into deals that served his own interests. His actions left Europe, NATO and the UN unsure if the old global order still mattered."
