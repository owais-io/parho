title: "Over 200 UK groups reject Home Secretary’s harsh asylum reforms"
summary: "The Home Secretary announced new rules that would end permanent protection, speed up deportations of families, and remove support for poor asylum seekers. Over 200 community organisations—charities, faith groups, sports clubs and local businesses—signed a letter calling the plans cruel and divisive. They said the changes would hurt refugees, stir hostility, and do nothing for national unity. The groups plan protests and events to show support for refugees and push back against the policy."
