summary: "Andy Burnham, the popular Greater Manchester mayor, is seen as a serious threat to Labour leader Keir Starmer. His strong local support, clean record, and name‑recognition make him a viable alternative for voters, especially those tired of Starmer’s style. Starmer’s party has tried to keep him out of the main national race, but Burnham’s popularity shows how difficult it is to balance ambition with unity inside Labour."
