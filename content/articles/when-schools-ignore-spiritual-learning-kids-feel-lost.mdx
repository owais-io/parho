title: "When schools ignore spiritual learning, kids feel lost"
summary: "New Zealand’s children rank lowest in mental well‑being among OECD countries, with bullying and anxiety driving depression and school avoidance. Researchers say schools focus on physical, mental and social learning but miss the spiritual part, which gives kids a sense of identity and meaning. Spiritual education—non‑religious practices like reflection, gratitude and nature walks—helps children feel connected, confident and ready to care for others. Small, optional sessions already show better confidence and empathy."
