title: "England Schools to Be Phone‑Free All Day, Says Secretary"
summary: "England’s education secretary has told school leaders that phones must stay out of schools all day – not just during lessons but also at lunch, breaks and between classes. The move will be checked by Ofsted and backed by a new government guide. Many schools already have phone rules, but a lot of students still use them without permission. The policy is part of a wider review that could lead to stricter rules for kids under 16 on social media."
