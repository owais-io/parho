title: "One Nation surges, Australia faces a new right‑wing challenge"
summary: "Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party is back in the spotlight, polling 26% in a Redbridge poll – a level that puts it ahead of the Coalition and close to Labor. The surge mirrors Nigel Farage’s rise in the UK, with both parties capitalising on fears over immigration, housing and living costs. While One Nation’s rhetoric has become more divisive, it still lacks the entrenched anger that fuels the UK’s Reform. Australia faces a new right‑wing challenge, but it may be short‑lived."
