title: "Lake Manly Reappears in Death Valley After Huge Rains"
summary: "After a series of heavy storms, a shallow lake called Lake Manly has returned to the bottom of Badwater Basin in Death Valley. The basin, which sits 282 feet below sea level, was filled with water from September to November, giving visitors a rare look at what the desert might have looked like in the past. This year’s lake is smaller than the one seen two years ago, but the rains were still enough to melt the dry basin and spark environmental concerns about the valley’s extreme heat and wildlife."
