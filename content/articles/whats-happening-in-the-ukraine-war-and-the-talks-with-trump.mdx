title: "**What’s happening in the Ukraine war and the talks with Trump?**"
summary: "- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with former U.S. President Donald Trump at Mar‑a‑Lago in Florida.   - He asked Trump to promise security guarantees for Ukraine that could last up to 50 years.   - Trump said he might think about a longer promise, but the draft plan he and Zelenskyy agreed on has 15 years of guarantees.   - Some people want guarantees that are longer, maybe 30 or 50 years, like the NATO “article‑5” rule that an attack on one member is an attack on all. **Other big points in the talks** - The war could end if Ukraine gets those guarantees.   - A meeting with Russia might happen once the U.S. and European leaders finish the plan.   - Donbas – a region in eastern Ukraine that Russia controls – still needs a decision. Some want it to become a free economic zone, others want it demilitarised.   - The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is still under Russian control. Both sides worry shelling could cause a nuclear accident. The plant is on a special track that could restart by 2027 if the war ends. **What to watch next** - Trump said a new phone call with Russia could happen soon.   - Ukraine wants a longer security promise, but the current plan offers 15 years.   - The war is still ongoing, but progress in talks is being made. We’ll keep you updated on any new deals or changes."
