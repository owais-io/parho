title: "Britain’s Christmas Could Be the Greenest Yet"
summary: "The National Energy System Operator says this year’s Christmas Day could have the lowest carbon emissions ever if the weather stays mild and windy. Last year, 40 % of the power used was from renewable sources, and Britain’s renewable capacity has now hit a record 53 GW. Even so, holiday lights and gifts still create huge waste—over 168 million discarded items last year. The government aims for net‑zero emissions by 2050, but costs will rise before easing again."
