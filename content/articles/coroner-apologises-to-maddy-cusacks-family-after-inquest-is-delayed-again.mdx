title: "Coroner apologises to Maddy Cusack's family after inquest is delayed again"
summary: "After the inquest into the death of Sheffield United midfielder Maddy Cusack was postponed again, the coroner apologized to her family. They were upset because the club sent 699 pages of new evidence just before Christmas, causing a second delay. The inquest is now scheduled to start 29 June, but could push back further if the former manager’s holiday conflicts with dates. The family’s lawyer says the club ignored repeated requests for a timely hearing."
