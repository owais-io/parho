title: "Australia coach faces growing problems before World Cup"
summary: "Australia coach Tony Popovic used a 1‑0 loss to Venezuela to test new players, but the match showed many gaps. With seven months until the World Cup, the team still needs to improve in possession and physical play. Popovic tried new starters, but injuries and unclear roles made it hard to decide who will go to the finals. He has to choose a squad soon."
