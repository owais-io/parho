title: "Iran Wants an Independent Review of Protest Deaths"
summary: "Iran says it will publish names of people killed in protests. Many citizens think the official count of 3,117 is too low, suspecting up to 30,000 deaths. Reformists and civil groups want a neutral inquiry, even from the UN, and a website to list names openly. They say families risk retaliation if they speak out. The government’s move is seen as a step toward transparency, but distrust remains high."
