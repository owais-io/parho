summary: "Post Office is closing its Horizon Shortfall Scheme, the main compensation program for sub‑postmasters hurt by a faulty IT system. The scheme will end Saturday at 11.59 pm after receiving more than 9,500 claims, yet it still processes around 350 new applications a month. Many operators risk missing out on up to £75,000 in payouts, as the Post Office and government consider limited exceptions. Billions have already been paid."
