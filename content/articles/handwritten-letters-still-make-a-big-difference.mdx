title: "Handwritten Letters Still Make a Big Difference"
summary: "Amnesty International’s Write For Rights campaign showed that handwritten letters still matter. Last year, 4.7 million people wrote letters to human rights defenders and their oppressors. Each letter takes time and care, and leaders are moved by real, personal messages. For activists under pressure, reading these notes of support can lift spirits. The Guardian encourages readers to send letters to be published."
