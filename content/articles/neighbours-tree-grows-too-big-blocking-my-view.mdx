title: "Neighbour’s Tree Grows Too Big, Blocking My View"
summary: "I moved into a house in Cardiff with a clear view of the sky, but a neighbour’s Leyland cypress—now a Western Red Cedar—has grown four metres and blocks the sightline. Birds perch on it, and I’ve asked the owner to cut it down, but they ignore me. After learning it’s a less vigorous, but still tall, conifer, I feel a bit more understanding, though the tree still feels like a looming monster."
