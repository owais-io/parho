title: "UK Ministers Criticised for Mishandling Abd el‑Fattah Case"
summary: "UK MPs say the government missed a chance to protect a British citizen, Alaa Abd el‑Fattah, who was jailed in Egypt and later freed. Critics, including Emily Thornberry, blame poor sharing of information and the lack of a special envoy to check background on people held abroad. Abd el‑Fattah’s old tweets praising violence have sparked calls to strip him of his citizenship, but the Home Office says the posts don’t meet legal grounds. The government is reviewing the failures."
