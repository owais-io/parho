title: "I counted 38 bird species in one day – why it matters"
summary: "During a winter walk around a wetland in West Yorkshire, I spotted 38 different bird species in a single day. The spot is part of an annual bird race that raises money for a local charity. I didn’t try to find any particular bird, I just noted what I saw. From magpies to gulls, the variety was impressive. It shows how many birds can share a small area in winter."
