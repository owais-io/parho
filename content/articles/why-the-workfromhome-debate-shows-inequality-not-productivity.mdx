title: "Why the work‑from‑home debate shows inequality, not productivity"
summary: "Hybrid work has settled in for many office workers, but it is far from a universal benefit. Data shows that higher‑paid, professional staff in cities enjoy flexible schedules, while lower‑paid jobs in retail, construction, and the poorest areas rarely get the option to work from home. Politicians argue that remote work is a luxury for the elite, while employers claim it keeps employees happy and productive. The truth is, productivity hasn’t dropped, but the perks stay unevenly spread."
