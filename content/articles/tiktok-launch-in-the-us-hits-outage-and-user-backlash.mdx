summary: "TikTok recently entered the U.S. market after its Chinese parent ByteDance sold the app to a U.S. investment group that added Oracle to the ownership. The launch was marred by a winter storm that knocked out Oracle data centres, causing an outage that stopped users from uploading videos. Many users complained that their videos were blocked or gone, and blamed the app for censorship. California’s governor announced an investigation, and Upscrolled jumped to the top of app‑store charts."
