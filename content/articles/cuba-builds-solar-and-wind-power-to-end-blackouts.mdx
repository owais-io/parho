title: "Cuba Builds Solar and Wind Power to End Blackouts"
summary: "With U.S. sanctions cutting oil supplies, Cuba is suffering long power cuts and a deep economic crisis. To fix this, the government is rapidly building solar parks and a big wind farm, mainly with Chinese help, aiming to get 26% of electricity from renewables by 2035. But the country lacks money, storage batteries and good transmission lines, so many poor people still can’t afford panels. The plan may ease blackouts, but challenges remain."
