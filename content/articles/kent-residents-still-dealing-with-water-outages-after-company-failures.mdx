summary: "Residents in Kent are still struggling with water outages after South East Water had a treatment plant fail, a power cut, and several burst mains. The problems left over 5,500 homes without water or with low pressure, adding to a week‑long blackout that hit 30,000 households earlier this month. MPs and the regulator are calling the company’s service poor, and the boss could face a licence review while still earning a large bonus."
