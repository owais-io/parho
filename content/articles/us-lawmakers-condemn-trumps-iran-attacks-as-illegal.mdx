title: "US Lawmakers Condemn Trump’s Iran Attacks as Illegal"
summary: "After President Trump ordered missile strikes on Iran, many U.S. lawmakers said the move was illegal because Congress was not consulted. Senators and representatives from both parties demanded the President return to the Capitol to explain the strike. They cited the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which requires a 48‑hour notice before deploying troops or launching military actions. Some Republicans praised the strike, but most critics call it a breach of constitutional limits."
