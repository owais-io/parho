title: "UK signs deals with US tech firms linked to former minister’s lobbying firm"
summary: "The UK government has signed agreements with US tech giants OpenAI and Palantir. Both companies were clients of Global Counsel, a lobbying firm co‑owned by former Labour minister Peter Mandelson. After Mandelson became ambassador to Washington, MPs raised questions about whether the lobbying firm helped secure the deals, especially a £241 m defence contract for Palantir that bypassed an open tender. OpenAI and the government say the deals were handled independently, but MPs want full disclosure."
