title: "England and Wales lost 366 pubs in 2025"
summary: "England and Wales lost 366 pubs in 2025 as rising costs and new tax rules pushed many closed for good. The pubs were demolished or turned into housing, offices and cafés, and almost none come back. Numbers fell from 38,989 to 38,623. The industry blames higher rates, wages and a 2026 rateable‑value hike, and is calling for pub‑specific tax relief. Treasury says it has helped with a support package."
