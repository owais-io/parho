title: "UK Charges Dual Nationals £589 to Travel"
summary: "The UK has introduced a new rule that forces people with dual citizenship to pay £589 for a “certificate of entitlement” before they can enter the country. Many argue the cost is excessive and confusing, especially when people can get a cheap electronic travel authorisation for other passports. The rule has sparked criticism from dual‑national residents, who say it restricts free travel and feels like a money‑grab."
