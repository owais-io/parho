title: "West Ham bans fan for holding up large protest banner"
summary: "A season‑ticket holder, Joshua Wood, was banned for five games after he picked up an oversized banner at a West Ham match. The banner called for the club’s owners to sell, and its size broke stadium rules that limit banners to 2m × 1m. West Ham said no video shows the banner being brought in, but footage shows Wood first lifting it. He plans to appeal, arguing the ban was about the banner’s size, not the protest itself."
