title: "Kyrgios’s singles career stalls as he struggles to return to top level"
summary: "Nick Kyrgios lost his first singles match in almost 10 months at the Brisbane International, showing weak form after knee and wrist surgeries. With only a few games played, the Australian is unlikely to get a wildcard for the Australian Open main draw. He may instead play doubles or exhibitions, and could try to qualify for the Slam. Tennis Australia hopes he can bring entertainment to the opening week of the tournament."
