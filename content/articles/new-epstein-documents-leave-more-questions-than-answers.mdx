title: "New Epstein Documents Leave More Questions Than Answers"
summary: "The Trump Justice Department released only a small, heavily redacted portion of the long‑awaited Jeffrey Epstein files, leaving most of the information already known and sparking anger from Congress and the press. The documents include disturbing photos and evidence that law enforcement ignored earlier abuse complaints. The release shows links to Trump and to former President Bill Clinton, but it offers little new detail. The scandal keeps growing and public outrage stays high."
