title: "What Labour has done in 2025: The good news"
summary: "Labour’s 2025 has focused on kids, workers, and the environment. The government added free breakfasts, cut school‑uniform costs, and lifted the two‑child limit on free meals. It rolled out millions of childcare slots, new NHS doctors and diagnostic centres, raised the minimum wage, and protected renters from sudden evictions. It also built new homes, invested in green energy, restored the rail network, and gave refugees support in London."
