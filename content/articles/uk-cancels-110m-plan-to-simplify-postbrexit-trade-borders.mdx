title: "UK Cancels £110m Plan to Simplify Post‑Brexit Trade Borders"
summary: "The UK government has abandoned its £110 million plan to create a “single trade window” that would have made post‑Brexit border checks easier. The project, started by the former Conservative government and still promised by Labour, was halted in 2024 after rising costs and little progress. The Treasury says the programme was closed early and no money has been spent since January. Policy work continues, but a launch date remains unclear."
