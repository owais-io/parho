title: "Trump’s Christmas Speech Misses the Point, Voters Say"
summary: "Trump gave a Christmas‑style speech in rural Pennsylvania, saying he had lowered prices and raised wages. He told people to cut back on stuff like pencils and dolls, while he was earning billions from crypto. Trump also attacked politicians and made jokes about windmills and trans people. Voters are growing tired: a Democrat won the Miami mayor’s office, and Indiana senators rejected his redistricting plan. Many Republicans are also distancing themselves from him."
