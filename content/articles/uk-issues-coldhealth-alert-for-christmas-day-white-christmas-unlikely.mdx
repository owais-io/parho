title: "UK Issues Cold‑Health Alert for Christmas Day, White Christmas Unlikely"
summary: "A yellow cold‑health alert runs from 6 pm on Christmas Day to noon on 27 Dec for south‑west England. The UK Health Security Agency warns that the low temperatures could increase hospital visits and raise the risk to vulnerable people. Forecasts say the day will be mostly bright and dry, with temps around 6‑7 °C, but snow is very unlikely. Drivers should plan ahead for busy holiday traffic. Winds could gust, and as the M25 and M5 may be, so leaving is advised."
