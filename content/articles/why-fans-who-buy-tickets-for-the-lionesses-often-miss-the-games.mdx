title: "Why Fans Who Buy Tickets for the Lionesses Often Miss the Games"
summary: "England’s women’s team sells almost 48,000 tickets for eight 2025 home games, but many seats stay empty, especially at Wembley. The gap comes from tickets going on sale months early, low prices, changing plans, and competition with men’s matches. Some fans also wait for better weather or transport. The FA is exploring resale options and better timing, but there’s no quick fix, though the numbers show growing interest in women’s football."
