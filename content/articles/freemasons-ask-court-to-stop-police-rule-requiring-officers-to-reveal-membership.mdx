title: "Freemasons Ask Court to Stop Police Rule Requiring Officers to Reveal Membership"
summary: "The Freemasons have filed for an emergency court order to stop the Metropolitan Police’s new rule that says officers must tell their bosses if they belong to the organisation. They say the rule is “religious discrimination” and unfair because it treats Masons differently. The police say the policy is meant to protect the public’s trust and prevent conflicts of interest. A judge may pause the rule while the full legal review is heard."
