title: "Tourist Zip Line Failure Kills Man and Injures Wife in Queensland"
summary: "On 22 October 2019, a man named Dean Sanderson and his wife fell from a zip line in Queensland because the cable wasn’t tied down tightly. The loose attachment let the line slip, sending them 20‑25 metres to the ground. Dean died from head and chest injuries; Shannon broke ribs and a shoulder blade. Investigators say the anchors were far weaker than safety rules require, and the company is now deregistered."
