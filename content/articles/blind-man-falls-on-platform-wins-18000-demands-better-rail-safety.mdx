title: "Blind Man Falls on Platform, Wins £18,000, Demands Better Rail Safety"
summary: "Abdul Eneser, a blind student, slipped off Manchester Piccadilly’s platform because it lacked tactile paving, nearly stepping onto a freight train. He pulled himself up, but was hurt and later sued Network Rail. After a three‑year case, he won £18,000 in compensation, though the company didn’t admit fault. The case has prompted tactile paving to be installed across the network and calls for better support, like live chat and clear help buttons, for people with visual impairments."
