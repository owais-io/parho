title: "Student Group Says US Universities Are Too Elite, Wants to Fix Them"
summary: "A student group called Class Action says American universities are too elitist and wants to fix them instead of tear them down. Born after Trump’s attacks and a Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, the group pushes for a new “academic social contract” that would curb legacy admissions, stop funneling grads into high‑pay jobs, and give students more say. With chapters on 76 campuses, it welcomes students of all views who want schools to serve the public."
