summary: "A lobbying firm called Precision Public Affairs, which works with big defence companies, is paying for a new Parliament group that supports the AUKUS security deal. The event will be held in February with Defence Minister Richard Marles. Rules say private money can't sponsor such groups, and some politicians and watchdogs say this breaks the rules and could give unfair access.
