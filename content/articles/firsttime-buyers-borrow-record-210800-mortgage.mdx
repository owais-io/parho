title: "First‑time buyers borrow record £210,800 mortgage"
summary: "First‑time buyers are borrowing more than ever, with the average mortgage now at £210,800 – a record high. Savills says lenders gave £82.8 bn to 390,000 buyers, up 30% from last year. The jump is helped by higher wages, lower house prices, easier lender rules, and a stamp‑duty holiday that let buyers pay no tax on the first £425,000. Most buyers are now buying houses instead of flats."
