title: "The Catholic Church’s Bold Move to Check Trump"
summary: "The U.S. Supreme Court and Congress can’t curb Trump, and the media is under attack. Some say the only way to stop his power is a “moral champion.” That role is being taken up by the Catholic Church, led by a senior bishop called Leo. The bishops have issued statements against harsh immigration rules, cuts to welfare, and Trump’s climate denial. Across the country, priests are organizing protests, boycotts and prayers to defend human dignity and civil rights."
