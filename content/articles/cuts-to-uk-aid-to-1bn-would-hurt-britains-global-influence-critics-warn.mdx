title: "Cuts to UK aid to £1bn would hurt Britain’s global influence, critics warn"
summary: "Reform UK wants to cut overseas aid to £1 billion a year, down from 0.5% of GDP. Experts say that would break existing promises to the UN, World Bank and vaccine groups, and leave no money for new crises. The cuts would weaken Britain’s role in global decision‑making and let other countries gain influence. Critics call the plan reckless and damaging to the country’s reputation."
