title: "Tesla’s EU sales drop as Chinese carmakers climb"
summary: "Tesla sold just 12,130 cars in the EU in November, down a third from last year’s 18,430. Its market share fell to 1.4%. Chinese rivals did the opposite – BYD’s sales nearly tripled to 42,500, while SAIC’s MG brand grew 26% to 217,000. Hybrid cars made up 44% of all sales, and battery‑electric cars accounted for 18.8% of the market. Tesla’s slump has been blamed on Musk’s political controversies, but his wealth remains huge."
