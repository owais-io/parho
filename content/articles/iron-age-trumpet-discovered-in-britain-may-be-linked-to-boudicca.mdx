title: "Iron Age Trumpet Discovered in Britain May Be Linked to Boudicca"
summary: "In Norfolk, archaeologists found a rare Iron Age war trumpet, one of only three known in Britain and the most complete ever. The bronze instrument, shaped like a snarling animal, would have been raised above warriors’ heads to blast a scary sound at enemies. It was buried with other military objects in land once ruled by the Iceni tribe, who rebelled under Boudicca, hinting at a historic connection."
