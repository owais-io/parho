title: "Democrats File Impeachment Papers Against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem"
summary: "After an ICE officer killed a woman in Minneapolis, Democratic Representative Robin Kelly filed three impeachment papers against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. The charges are obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust, and self‑dealing. About 70 congresspeople support the move. Noem and the Trump administration deny the allegations, while the Minneapolis mayor wants ICE agents removed from the city. The impeachment is unlikely to pass in the Republican‑controlled House, and Democrats are also looking at other ways to curb ICE."
