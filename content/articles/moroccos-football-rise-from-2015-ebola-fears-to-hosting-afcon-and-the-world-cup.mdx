title: "Morocco’s Football Rise: From 2015 Ebola Fears to Hosting Afcon and the World Cup"
summary: "Ten years ago Morocco pulled out of hosting the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations because of Ebola fears, causing a ban and a costly move to Equatorial Guinea. Today it’s a football hub, hosting the 2024 Afcon, two women’s Afcons and will stage the 2030 World Cup. These events boost infrastructure, tourism and national pride, but critics say money should also go to social services. Morocco now uses football to showcase its culture and growing influence."
