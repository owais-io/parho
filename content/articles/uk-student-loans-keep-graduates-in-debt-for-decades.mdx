title: "UK student loans keep graduates in debt for decades"
summary: "After a recent budget move, the UK froze the amount graduates need to earn before starting to pay back their student loans. This keeps the repayment threshold at £29,385, meaning students pay 9 % of any earnings above that. With high interest, the debt can grow for up to 30 years, leaving many graduates stuck with long‑term financial pressure. The government says much of the cost will be written off, but critics argue it still hurts the future workforce."
