title: "Minneapolis hit by a huge ICE operation"
summary: "Minneapolis has been overwhelmed by a massive ICE operation that sent 3,000 federal agents to the city, outnumbering local police five‑to‑one. Agents have appeared at schools, churches and even private homes, stopping people—regardless of citizenship—at traffic lights and on sidewalks. The crackdown has scared residents, shut down most immigrant‑owned businesses, and forced community groups to organize food‑delivery and legal‑observer support."
