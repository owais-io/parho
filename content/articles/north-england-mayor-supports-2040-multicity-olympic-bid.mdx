title: "North England Mayor Supports 2040 Multi‑City Olympic Bid"
summary: "Northern leaders want the 2040 Olympics to be held across several cities in the north instead of London. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, says it would be unfair for London to host a fourth time and that a northern bid would help rebuild the region’s economy and give kids new dreams. The bid would use the north’s sporting venues. The government has not yet decided, and it will be up to the British Olympic Association to weigh the proposal."
