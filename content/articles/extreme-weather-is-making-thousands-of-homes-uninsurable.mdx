title: "Extreme Weather Is Making Thousands of Homes Uninsurable"
summary: "Extreme weather is pushing thousands of homes into a no‑insurance zone. As floods, wildfires and storms grow more frequent, insurers are pulling out, leaving government‑run plans to step in. This leaves many homeowners stuck in “mortgage‑prisoners” because their houses can’t be insured, and banks risk defaults. A UK scheme called Flood Re keeps premiums low, but it will end in 2039, and resilience is falling behind."
