title: "UK bans junk food ads on TV before 9 pm"
summary: "UK has started a new rule that stops ads for high‑fat, high‑sugar and high‑salt foods from airing on TV before 9pm or online. The goal is to cut childhood obesity. The advertising industry had already been following the rules, so the change mainly affects brand ads that can no longer show the actual product. Companies are moving money to billboards and other media to keep reaching kids."
