title: "Australia to grade universities on how they handle protests about antisemitism"
summary: "Australia’s government will give universities a report card that grades how well they manage protests and antisemitism on campus. The grading looks at policies, how fast and fairly protests are dealt with, complaints, training and a clear definition of antisemitism. The first review will cover top universities in May, and schools that fail may lose funding. Critics say the system is blunt and could hurt free speech."
