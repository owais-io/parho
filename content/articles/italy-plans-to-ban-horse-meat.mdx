title: "Italy Plans to Ban Horse Meat"
summary: "Italy is drafting a law that would treat horses, donkeys and mules as pets and make it illegal to kill them. The bill would carry up to three‑year jail terms and fines of up to €100,000, plus a €6 million fund for breeders. While supporters say it ends animal exploitation, opponents warn it will erase part of Italian food culture and hurt regional jobs. About 83 % of Italians say they don’t eat horse meat, though some still do."
