title: "England bans most hare hunting for the year"
summary: "England’s government will ban most hare hunting this year, except a short window in the winter, to protect breeding mothers and young. The new rule stops shooting hares from February to October, the breeding season, and also bans trail hunts where dogs follow a scent instead of a real animal. The move follows public support and aims to stop the decline of brown hares, whose numbers have fallen sharply. Hunters still get a limited shooting period in spring."
