title: "Labour’s Budget Leaves Peterlee Disappointed"
summary: "Labour's budget has disappointed many in Peterlee, a town that used to be a Labour stronghold. Local councillor David Taylor-Gooby says the plan lacks ambition. Residents feel trapped by high council taxes and a cost‑of‑living crisis. The lifting of the two‑child benefit was praised but still seen as too little. Many former Labour supporters are now leaning towards the Reform Party, which won most seats on the county council."
