title: "Former US general says coalition must be strong to counter Russia"
summary: "Former US general Ben Hodges says the Anglo‑French‑led force for Ukraine needs to be ready to act fast, especially against Russian drones. The UK and France plan to send troops after a ceasefire, but Russia refuses any Western soldiers on Ukrainian soil. Only a handful of European nations have joined, and the size is unclear—maybe 10‑15,000 troops, much smaller than NATO’s Bosnia force. The UK will vote on how many troops it sends once a ceasefire is agreed."
