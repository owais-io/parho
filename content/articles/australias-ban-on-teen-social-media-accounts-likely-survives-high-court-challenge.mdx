title: "Australia’s ban on teen social media accounts likely survives high court challenge"
summary: "Australia has a law that bans people under 16 from having social‑media accounts. Two 15‑year‑olds are taking the case to the high court, arguing the ban stops their right to talk about politics. Judges think the rule only cuts a small amount of political chatter, so it probably won't be struck down. The government says the ban protects kids’ health, and similar rules are being considered in other countries."
