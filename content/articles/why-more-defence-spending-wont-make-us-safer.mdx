title: "Why More Defence Spending Won’t Make Us Safer"
summary: "This letter argues that pumping more money into the armed forces will not make the UK safer. It points to wasted billions on projects like the Ajax armoured vehicle, which is delayed, defective, and harmful to soldiers. The writer calls for a thorough audit of the Ministry of Defence before any further spend and urges the public to be part of the security conversation, not just accept big defence budgets."

It points to wasted billions on projects like the Ajax armoured vehicle, which is delayed, defective, and harmful to soldiers. The writer calls for a thorough audit of the Ministry of Defence before any further spend and urges the public to be part of the security conversation, not just accept big defence budgets.
