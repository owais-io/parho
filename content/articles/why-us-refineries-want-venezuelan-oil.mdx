title: "Why US refineries want Venezuelan oil"
summary: "US refineries are built to handle thick, heavy crude – the kind that comes from Venezuela.  Trump wants cheaper energy, so bringing in Venezuelan oil could boost refinery jobs and cut reliance on expensive Canadian imports.  But Venezuela’s oil output has dropped because of sanctions and neglect, and reviving it would need huge investment and political stability.  The market has reacted calmly so far, and rebuilding production will take years."
