title: "Labour Quickly Reverses Pub Tax Decision – Shows Government Learning but Repeats Treasury Mistakes"
summary: "Labour MPs were relieved when the government reversed a plan that would have raised business rates for pubs and hotels. The change happened fast, after a strong push from a group of MPs and industry voices. The move follows several recent U‑turns on benefits, winter fuel, and farm tax, all of which stem from Treasury budget cuts that ignored real‑world impact. MPs say the government still needs to listen better before making big policy changes."
