title: "Trump’s foreign policy is driven by personal interests, not ideology"
summary: "Trump’s foreign moves show he listens to many people, but he mainly acts for his own benefit. His core advisers—Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, and his sons—along with a broader mix of family, media and politicians keep sending ideas 24/7. Critics say this makes his policy unpredictable and power‑driven, not guided by clear values. It turns the US into a rogue power, raising fears of a more isolated, transactional approach that benefits Trump’s business interests."
