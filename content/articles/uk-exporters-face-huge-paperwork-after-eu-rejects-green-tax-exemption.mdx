title: "UK exporters face huge paperwork after EU rejects green tax exemption"
summary: "UK manufacturers will face a huge amount of paperwork starting in January because the EU rejected a promised exemption from new green taxes. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will require exporters to prove how much carbon was used to make items like steel and washing machines. Small and medium‑sized businesses say the extra paperwork and potential costs will hurt them, especially when competition is tight. The UK government will provide support, but the deal looks unlikely to happen before Easter."
