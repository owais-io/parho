title: "England’s batting collapses in Australia match"
summary: "England’s batting collapsed in a match against Australia, with early wickets and shaky starts leaving the team unable to recover. After a decent first innings, a storm of Australian bowlers, notably Boland and Starc, claimed key wickets, leaving England to chase a modest total. Despite late runs from Atkinson and Carse, England fell short, ending the match at 204 and continuing a pattern of failure to answer the same questions."
