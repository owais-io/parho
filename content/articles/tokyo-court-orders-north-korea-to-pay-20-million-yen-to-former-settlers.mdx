title: "Tokyo court orders North Korea to pay 20 million yen to former settlers"
summary: "A Tokyo court has ordered North Korea to pay 20 million yen (about £94,000) to each of four people who were lured to North Korea under a “paradise on Earth” scheme. The program, running from 1959 to 1984, promised jobs, education and homes, but many suffered harsh conditions and could not visit Japan. Though the court cannot enforce the award, the ruling is a rare legal win for the survivors."
