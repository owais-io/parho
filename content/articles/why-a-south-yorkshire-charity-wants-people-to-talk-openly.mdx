title: "Why a South Yorkshire charity wants people to talk openly"
summary: "People in a small white‑majority town in Rotherham feel they can’t speak openly about tough topics like immigration and racism. A local charity called Who Is Your Neighbour? runs free, relaxed conversations where anyone can share their thoughts. Military veterans and locals gather in a community centre, talk about flags, national identity, and local hate incidents. The facilitators use three rules: speak out, assume good intentions, stay curious. The goal is to give everyone a voice and build trust."
