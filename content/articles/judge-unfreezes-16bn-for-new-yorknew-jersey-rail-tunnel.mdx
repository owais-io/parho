title: "Judge Unfreezes $16bn for New York‑New Jersey Rail Tunnel"
summary: "Judge Jeannette Vargas in New York lifted the Trump‑era freeze that had halted $16 billion earmarked for the Gateway Project, a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River linking Manhattan to New Jersey. The funds were frozen after a federal review over alleged race‑and‑sex‑bias rules. States say the freeze is political retaliation, and Trump has been accused of asking for airport and Penn Station to be renamed in return for the money. Work can resume."
