summary: "The Cornish Pirates rugby club in Penzance is fighting to stay alive. Owner Sir Richard Evans is stepping down after his three‑year plan ends, and a group of local businessmen is stepping in. They want a new arena near the A30 that can host rugby, concerts and maybe a hotel. The club hopes to reach England’s top league, but its small stadium and low attendance make it tough.
