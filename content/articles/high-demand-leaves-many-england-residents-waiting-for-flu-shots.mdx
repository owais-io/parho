title: "High demand leaves many England residents waiting for flu shots."
summary: "England is facing a flu‑shot shortage because demand is higher than ever. Big pharmacy chains like Boots, Superdrug and Tesco have almost no available appointments, especially for older adults and people with health conditions. NHS stocks are not empty – they still have millions of shots – but local shortages have made it hard to book. Independent pharmacies are faring better. Experts urge people to book early and get vaccinated to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed."
