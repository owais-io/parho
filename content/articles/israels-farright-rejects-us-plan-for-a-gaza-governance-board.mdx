title: "Israel’s far‑right rejects U.S. plan for a Gaza governance board"
summary: "Israel's far‑right coalition rejects the U.S. plan to set up a Gaza governance board, saying it betrays Netanyahu. Finance minister Bezalel Smotrich wants a military government and new settlements, and says Turkey and Qatar shouldn’t lead. The U.S. White House has formed a “Gaza executive board” and a larger “board of peace” chaired by Trump. Netanyahu says the plan is uncoordinated and a threat to security. The war still hurts civilians, and winter storms add danger."
