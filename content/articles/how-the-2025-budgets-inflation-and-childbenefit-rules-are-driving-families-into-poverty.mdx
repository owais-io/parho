title: "How the 2025 Budget’s Inflation and Child‑Benefit Rules Are Driving Families into Poverty"
summary: "In Kent, a mother with four children says she’s often left crying because she can’t keep up with food, gas and electricity costs. A local food bank now hands out over 1,100 parcels a month – the most in the country – but its donations are falling and food prices are rising. The government’s “two‑child benefit cap” means parents only get extra money for their first two kids, pushing many families into deeper poverty."
