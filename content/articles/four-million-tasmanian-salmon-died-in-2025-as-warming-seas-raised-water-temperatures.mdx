title: "Four Million Tasmanian Salmon Died in 2025 as Warming Seas Raised Water Temperatures"
summary: "Four million Tasmanian salmon died prematurely in 2025 because sea temperatures rose. EPA data shows 500,000 fish died in November and December, with a peak of 40 tonnes per day in December. Temperatures around 18 °C lower oxygen, damage organs, reduce appetite and boost disease risk. No fines or regulatory action yet, unlike Norway where firms are heavily penalised for mass deaths. Welfare groups are demanding punishment, but Salmon Tasmania has not replied."
