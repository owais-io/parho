title: "New TB drug could shorten treatment and improve cure rates"
summary: "Scientists tested a new TB drug, sorfequiline, in a study of 309 patients in five countries. Results suggest it works better than current medicines and is just as safe, meaning people could get cured faster and with fewer clinic visits. If proven in larger trials, the drug could become a universal, shorter treatment for all TB patients, but experts warn it shouldn't replace better testing and careful use."
