title: "Congress warns VA about planned database of non‑citizen workers, fearing it could fuel immigration crackdowns and hurt veterans' care."
summary: "More than 50 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the VA and Homeland Security. They said the agency’s new report on every non‑citizen who works for or is linked to the VA will be shared with immigration officials. The lawmakers worry the data could lead to arrests, deportations, and scare away skilled foreign doctors and nurses, worsening the VA’s already‑tight staff shortage. The VA says it’s just a routine background‑check update."
