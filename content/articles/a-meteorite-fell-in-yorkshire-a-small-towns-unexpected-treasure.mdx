title: "A Meteorite Fell in Yorkshire – A Small Town’s Unexpected Treasure"
summary: "A meteorite fell in the Yorkshire Wolds back in 1795, leaving a brick obelisk on a field beside a holiday park. The stone, called the Wold Cottage meteorite, is the first widely recognised rock from outer space. It’s now in the Natural History Museum, but the spot still has a plaque. The local landowner built a quirky monument, and visitors can still walk to it, remembering that even small places can hold cosmic surprises."
