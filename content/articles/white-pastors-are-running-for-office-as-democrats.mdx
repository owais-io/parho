title: "White pastors are running for office as Democrats"
summary: "A new wave of white Christian leaders, like 41‑year‑old pastor Justin Douglas, are joining the Democratic Party to represent working‑class churchgoers. They say Democrats have drifted away from faith‑based voters while Republicans have used religious identity for politics. Trump’s presidency pushed many pastors to step in, hoping to counter Christian nationalism and show that faith can support progressive ideas. These candidates aim to bridge the gap between church and politics."
