Other powerful figures, like Sudan’s former president Omar al‑Bashir, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. official Pete Hegseth, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, face similar charges but have not been arrested. The piece argues that these leaders believe they can avoid justice, showing a dangerous trend of impunity."
