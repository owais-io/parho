title: "Did the US have a legal reason to attack Venezuela?"
summary: "Trump said U.S. forces hit Venezuela and seized President Maduro and his wife. Law experts say this violates the UN charter, which forbids attacking another country unless the U.N. Security Council approves or the country is in self‑defence – neither of which applies here. Because the U.S. can veto any U.N. sanctions, it will likely avoid punishment. If the attack is allowed, it could encourage other nations to break international law."
