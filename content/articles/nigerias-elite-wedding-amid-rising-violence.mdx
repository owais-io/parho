title: "Nigeria’s elite wedding amid rising violence"
summary: "In February, the junior defence minister’s family threw a six‑day, high‑profile wedding in Abuja that drew the country’s top politicians, business leaders and even the president’s rivals. While the party glittered, gunmen raided a church in Benue state, abducting nine teens, and jihadists killed more than 150 people in Kwara. Critics say the government’s lavish celebration shows it is ignoring Nigeria’s growing insecurity and is using the event to win political favour."
