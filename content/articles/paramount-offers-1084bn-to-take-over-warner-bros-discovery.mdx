title: "Paramount offers $108.4bn to take over Warner Bros Discovery"
summary: "Paramount Skydance, backed by the Ellison family, has made a $108.4bn all‑cash offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), even though Netflix had already agreed to buy WBD’s studio and streaming arm for $82.7bn. Paramount says its deal gives WBD shareholders more money and is easier to approve by regulators. Netflix says it’s already finished its deal and is unbothered by the offer. The bid could still face scrutiny, and employees worry about job cuts."
