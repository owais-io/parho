title: "Supreme Court Blocks Trump’s Plan to Send National Guard to Chicago"
summary: "The Supreme Court said no, rejecting President Trump's request to deploy National Guard units near Chicago. The move would have helped federal agents at an ICE center amid protests. A judge in Illinois had already barred the troops, and the Court agreed, saying the government couldn't prove a real danger. The ruling, decided 6‑3, means the troops stay home and could affect other cities fighting immigration enforcement."
