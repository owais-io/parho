title: "Starmer Loses Credibility After Choosing Peter Mandelson as U.S. Ambassador"
summary: "Keir Starmer, the UK Labour leader, faced backlash when he appointed Peter Mandelson as Britain’s ambassador to the United States. The choice sparked anger because Mandelson had a past tied to the Epstein scandal and had lied during vetting. Starmer’s speech trying to explain the mistake was seen as weak, and many Labour supporters felt betrayed. The incident is seen as a turning point that could end Starmer’s leadership before the 2025 elections."
