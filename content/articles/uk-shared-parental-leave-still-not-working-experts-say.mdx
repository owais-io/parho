title: "UK shared parental leave still not working, experts say"
summary: "Experts say the UK’s shared parental leave scheme, meant to let both parents split up to 52 weeks of leave, has barely taken off. Only about 1.5% of requests in major public bodies were for shared leave—roughly one in 64. Uptake is higher among high‑earning dads and is almost unchanged since 2015. The policy is seen as a class issue, and lawmakers are calling for bigger reforms and a new review."
