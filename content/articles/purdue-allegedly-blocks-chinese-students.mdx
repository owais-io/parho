title: "Purdue Allegedly Blocks Chinese Students"
summary: "Students and faculty at Purdue University in Indiana say the school has an unofficial rule that automatically rejects applicants from China and other so‑called adversary countries. The claim comes after a letter from a U.S. congressional committee asked universities to hand over data on Chinese students. Purdue says there is no ban, but many international applicants say offers were withdrawn without explanation. The issue reflects wider U.S. pressure to limit Chinese scholars in higher education."
