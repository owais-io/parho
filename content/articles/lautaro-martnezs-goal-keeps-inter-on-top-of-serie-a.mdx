title: "Lautaro Martínez’s goal keeps Inter on top of Serie A"
summary: "Lautaro Martínez’s strike gave Inter a 1‑0 win over Atalanta and kept them in first place in Serie A. Even with a rocky season, Inter are still tops because of goals like this one. Scoring is hard in Italy — the league has one of the lowest averages this season — so a single goal can change the standings.
