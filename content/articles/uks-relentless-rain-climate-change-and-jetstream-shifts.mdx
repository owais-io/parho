title: "UK’s relentless rain: Climate change and jet‑stream shifts"
summary: "Rain has fallen every day in the UK this year, with over 100 flood warnings across the country. Scientists say the same jet‑stream shifts that caused flooding in Spain and Portugal are now keeping the UK soaked. The heavy rain is linked to climate change, which makes the jet stream more erratic and lets warm air hold more moisture. Despite the wetness, reservoirs are filling and the UK is no longer in drought."
