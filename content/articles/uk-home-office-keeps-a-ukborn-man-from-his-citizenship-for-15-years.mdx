title: "UK Home Office keeps a UK‑born man from his citizenship for 15 years"
summary: "Born in London to a Nigerian mother on a visa, Olu Sowemimo was denied a British passport and told he wasn’t a citizen. He lived in legal limbo for 15 years, fighting the Home Office’s “good‑character” rule that blocks many UK‑born children from citizenship. After a long legal battle, he finally got his passport at 32. Labour’s new immigration plan could push even more kids into the same uncertain, painful situation."
