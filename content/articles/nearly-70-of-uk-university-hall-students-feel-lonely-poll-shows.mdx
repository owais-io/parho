title: "Nearly 70% of UK university hall students feel lonely, poll shows"
summary: "A recent poll found that more than two‑thirds of students living in UK university halls feel lonely or isolated. About a third say it happens often, while 37% say it happens sometimes. Students blame a lack of people to chat with, long study hours, noisy rooms and flat layouts. High rent and living costs also cut social budgets. Most want easier access to mental‑health help and round‑the‑clock staff support."
