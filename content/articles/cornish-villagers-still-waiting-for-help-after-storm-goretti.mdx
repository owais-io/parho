title: "Cornish Villagers Still Waiting for Help After Storm Goretti"
summary: "After Storm Goretti, many people in Cornwall’s remote village of New Mill are still without power, heat, water or phone service. Residents like 86‑year‑old Linda Williams use old lamps and share food, but the lack of national support is frustrating. Local councillors and the MP have asked for a national emergency response, while the government says it cares but hasn't deployed a crisis team yet. Roads remain blocked by fallen trees, leaving the community isolated and vulnerable."
