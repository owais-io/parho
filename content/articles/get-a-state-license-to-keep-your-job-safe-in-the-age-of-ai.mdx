title: "Get a state license to keep your job safe in the age of AI"
summary: "Get a state license to keep your job safe even as AI grows. Licenses show you’ve studied, passed exams, and meet safety standards. Jobs like accounting, nursing, plumbing, and engineering stay needed because machines need people to run them. Licensing also helps you earn more, start a business, and find better jobs. Though some say boards are too powerful, the benefits of a license—credibility, higher pay, and job security—outweigh the downsides."
