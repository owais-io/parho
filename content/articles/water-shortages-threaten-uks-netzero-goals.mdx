title: "Water Shortages Threaten UK’s Net‑Zero Goals"
summary: "A new study shows that the UK might run out of water to power its clean‑energy plans, especially for hydrogen and carbon‑capture plants that need a lot of water. Experts say some areas could see shortages as early as 2030, putting pressure on water companies and the government. While the government plans to build reservoirs and cut water leaks, regulators warn the water system is poorly managed and could worsen drought risks."
