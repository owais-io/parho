title: "Jaguar Land Rover Sales Drop Sharply After US Tariffs and Cyber Attack"
summary: "Jaguar Land Rover sold far fewer cars in Q4 because U.S. tariffs cut exports and a cyber‑attack halted its factories for weeks.

The biggest falls were in North America and Europe, while the new electric model faced a mixed reaction."
