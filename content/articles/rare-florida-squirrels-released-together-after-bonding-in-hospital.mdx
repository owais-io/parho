title: "Rare Florida squirrels released together after bonding in hospital"
summary: "Two young, endangered Florida fox squirrels were rescued after falling from their nests and spent almost two months in the von Arx wildlife hospital. While there, they were fed special diets and kept together, which helped them learn to climb, jump and find food. The pair bonded, so the team released them side‑by‑side back into a pine‑cypress forest near the first squirrel’s nest. The release happened before the holidays, giving the animals a better chance to survive."
