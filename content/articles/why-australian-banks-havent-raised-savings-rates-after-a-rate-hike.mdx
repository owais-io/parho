title: "Why Australian Banks Haven’t Raised Savings Rates After a Rate Hike"
summary: "The Reserve Bank raised the cash rate, and Australian banks quickly lifted mortgage rates by the same amount. But savings account rates have stayed the same or are being updated slowly, with many banks waiting to see how customers react and what competitors do. Some banks offer small increases only on certain products, and many bonus‑rate accounts have tricky conditions that let customers miss the headline rate. Consumers are urged to shop around for better savings rates."
