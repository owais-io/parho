title: "Scientists launch AI app that can identify dinosaur footprints"
summary: "Scientists have made an app that uses AI to recognize dinosaur footprints. The app looks at 2,000 unlabelled prints, finds patterns, and groups similar tracks. It can match a new print to others about 90% of the time, helping scientists decide which dinosaur might have made it. The study also hints that some very old tracks look like bird feet, but experts warn this could be due to ground effects."
