title: "We Should Keep Studying Solar Geoengineering"
summary: "The Guardian editorial says we shouldn’t ban research into solar geoengineering, arguing that studying ways to reflect sunlight could help slow climate change. Some critics say the article misrepresents Africa’s views and ignores the need to cut emissions. Experts in the letters explain that research should be careful and transparent, and that geoengineering is not a replacement for cutting CO₂. They stress that African scientists deserve a seat at the table, and that stopping research would hurt the vulnerable."
