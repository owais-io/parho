title: "UK plans first rules on how long toddlers can use screens"
summary: "The UK’s Education Department is about to issue guidance on the amount of screen time young children should have. Research shows almost all two‑year‑olds watch devices for more than two hours each day, and heavy use is linked to smaller vocabularies and more behavioural issues. Teachers say more four‑year‑olds are missing basic life skills. The government, parents and teachers want stricter limits and extra support for early learning."
