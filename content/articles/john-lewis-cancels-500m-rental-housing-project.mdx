title: "John Lewis Cancels £500m Rental Housing Project"
summary: "John Lewis has dropped its £500 million plan to build almost 1,000 rental homes in Bromley, Reading and West Ealing. The decision comes as the property market has cooled and its finance partner, Aberdeen, can’t raise enough money. The retailer says it will refocus on its core brands, John Lewis and Waitrose, after years of trying to grow into build‑to‑rent. The move hurts consumers who were hoping for a new quality‑first rental option."
