title: "Ireland Gives Artists a Permanent Weekly Income"
summary: "Ireland has turned a trial that paid artists €325 a week into a permanent program. The Basic Income for the Arts will give 2,000 creators a steady stipend for three years, then they must skip a cycle before reapplying. Studies show the pilot cut anxiety, cut extra work and boosted arts spending, and the scheme already made more money back than it cost. Artists still need other income for rent and living costs."
