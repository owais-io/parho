title: "Starmer Must Rebuild Labour After Gorton & Denton Loss"
summary: "Labour’s loss in the Gorton & Denton by‑election has exposed cracks in Keir Starmer’s leadership. Advisors have long dismissed views that matter to progressive voters, but the result shows that many have turned to the Greens. Starmer is now being forced to rethink the party’s culture, calling for more empathy and less elitism. He has already taken steps, such as fighting deep‑fake images and condemning anti‑immigration comments, to show he can change."
