title: "Unison’s new leader vows to stop backing Labour’s right wing"
summary: "Andrea Egan, the left‑leaning social worker who just won Unison’s top post, has said the union will end support for Labour’s “right wing” and will not back a 2026 leadership change that would replace Keir Starmer with Wes Streeting. She criticised Streeting’s handling of resident‑doctor strikes and called for a fresh, radical direction for the union and the party. Unison is Britain’s biggest health‑care union and a major Labour donor."
