title: "My van was set on fire, and I’ve still not received my insurance payment"
summary: "A self‑employed tradesman’s van was hit by a speeding driver and burned after crashing into barriers. He reported the crash to his insurer, Autonet, but after six weeks he received no reply. The van’s tools are stuck in a storage compound that charges £25 a day, adding stress. Autonet’s communication was slow, offered half the claimed amount, and only settled the claim after 169 days and many emails. The story shows how frustrating insurance disputes can be."
