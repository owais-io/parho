title: "England’s Ashes confidence looks misplaced after early loss"
summary: "England began the Ashes with a lot of confidence but lost two days into the first Test. The writer points out that England’s record against Australia has been poor for years, with many defeats and few wins. The team’s bold attitude is seen as over‑confident, especially after a shaky second innings. Despite the early setback, the author believes England still has a chance to turn the series around, as past matches show unpredictable outcomes."
