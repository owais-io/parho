title: "Victoria’s voting system is broken – how to fix it and who benefits"
summary: "Victoria still uses a voting method called group voting tickets (GVTs) that lets parties decide where a voter’s preferences go. This lets tiny parties win seats even with almost no votes, as happened in 2018 when deals let little‑known candidates get elected. The system is now being reviewed, and most experts want to ditch GVTs. A change would need a referendum, and the outcome could shift power in the state’s upper house."
