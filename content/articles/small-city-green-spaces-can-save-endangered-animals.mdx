title: "Small City Green Spaces Can Save Endangered Animals"
summary: "Small city green spaces can help keep endangered animals alive. Even tiny patches – like roadside verges, balcony plants or back‑yard gardens – offer food, shelter and water for about 400 threatened species in Australian cities. Local groups, councils and residents can plant native species, add birdbaths and nest boxes, and join projects such as Melbourne’s Pollinator Corridor. Together, these small actions create wildlife routes and protect nature amid urban growth."
