title: "Keir Starmer’s China trip: a trade‑security balancing act"
summary: "The Guardian argues that Britain’s new prime minister must meet China to tap its huge market and advanced tech, but should keep a firm stance on security and human‑rights issues. China’s economic weight, AI power, and green tech make engagement sensible, yet concerns over Hong Kong, Uyghurs, and spying remain. Starmer promises to raise these matters with President Xi while trying not to trade security for commerce."
