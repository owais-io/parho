title: "NHS Health Centres Built with Private Money May Never Be Paid Back"
summary: "A letter from Lord Hutton explains why the NHS’s new health centre in Didcot has been stalled for more than a decade. Private developers built the building but demand a higher return on investment than the NHS can afford. The local care board worries the cost will scare off any GP practice willing to run the centre. The letter also briefly notes other Guardian letters on cricket, emissions, a crossword, and a home‑dance suggestion."
