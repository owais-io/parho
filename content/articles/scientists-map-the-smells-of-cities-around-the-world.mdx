title: "Scientists Map the Smells of Cities Around the World"
summary: "Scientists are creating a map of what cities smell like. Dr Kate McLean‑MacKenzie asks people to walk streets and note each scent, how strong it is, how long it lasts and what it reminds them of. She has mapped 40 places from Glasgow to Paris to Kolkata. The resulting atlas shows the moment a smell appears and where it comes from. It could record how city smells change over time and help us notice scents we miss."
