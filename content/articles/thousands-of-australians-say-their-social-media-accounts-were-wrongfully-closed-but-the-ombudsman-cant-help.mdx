title: "Thousands of Australians Say Their Social Media Accounts Were Wrongfully Closed, but the Ombudsman Can’t Help"
summary: "In the past 2½ years, more than 1,500 Australians complained to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) about digital platforms, and about a third were about accounts shut down by mistake. The TIO has no power to fix these problems, leaving users like small‑business owner Karen stuck. The report calls for expanding the TIO’s role so people can appeal social‑media bans, as the government plans a new rule banning kids under 16 from 12 sites from Dec. 10."
