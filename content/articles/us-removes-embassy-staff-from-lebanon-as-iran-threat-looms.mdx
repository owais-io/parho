summary: "The U.S. has taken out dozens of non‑essential workers from its Beirut embassy because of worries that Iran could hit U.S. sites if tensions rise. Around 30‑50 staff members flew home via the airport. While the embassy stays open for essential work, officials say it’s safer to keep only core staff on site.
