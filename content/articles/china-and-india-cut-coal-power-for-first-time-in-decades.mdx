title: "China and India Cut Coal Power for First Time in Decades"
summary: "China and India, the world's biggest coal users, saw their coal‑powered electricity drop for the first time since 1973, thanks to a boom in clean energy. China added 300 GW of solar and 100 GW of wind last year, while India installed 35 GW of solar, 6 GW of wind and 3.5 GW of hydro. This shift could curb global emissions, though hotter summers or slower growth could undo the gains."
