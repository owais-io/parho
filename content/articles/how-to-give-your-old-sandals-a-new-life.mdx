title: "How to Give Your Old Sandals a New Life"
summary: "Every year, Australia imports 110 million shoes that can sit in landfills for decades. Instead of buying new sandals, you can keep old ones running longer by cleaning, conditioning, and repairing them. Start with a gentle wash, use leather or shoe cream, and spray a waterproofing coat. Replace worn soles or buckles with a cobbler, and fix Velcro by stitching a new fluffy side or clearing the hooks. These simple steps save money and the planet."
