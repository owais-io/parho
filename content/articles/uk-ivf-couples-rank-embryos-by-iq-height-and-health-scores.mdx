title: "UK IVF Couples Rank Embryos by IQ, Height and Health Scores"
summary: "Some couples in the UK are using a loophole to rank their IVF embryos by predicted IQ, height and disease risk. They get the embryos’ raw DNA data, send it to U.S. companies like Herasight, and receive scores. The UK’s fertility regulator says such tests are illegal for embryo selection, but couples can still get them abroad. The practice raises scientific and ethical worries, especially about fairness and the safety of using unproven tests."
