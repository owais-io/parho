title: "Trump Aims to Tear Down U.S. Alliances"
summary: "Trump has pushed a hard‑talking, isolationist style that tests the United States’ long‑standing partnerships, especially with Europe. He even talked about buying Greenland and has been hostile toward the UK over the Chagos Islands. European leaders, such as Angela Merkel, have tried to keep the alliance alive with patience and diplomacy, but Trump's erratic rhetoric and love for national power make the relationship fragile. The article argues that European history warns against the dangers of such a leader."
