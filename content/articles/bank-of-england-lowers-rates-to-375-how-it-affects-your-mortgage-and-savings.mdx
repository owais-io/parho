summary: "On Thursday, the Bank of England lowered its main interest rate from 4 % to 3.75 %, the fourth cut this year. Most people with fixed‑rate mortgages will see no change, but those with tracker mortgages could pay about £29 less a month. Variable‑rate borrowers might also benefit if lenders adjust rates.
