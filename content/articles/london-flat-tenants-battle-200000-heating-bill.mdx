title: "London flat tenants battle £200,000 heating bill"
summary: "Residents in a new‑build flat block in Greenwich were shocked when their landlord sent a £200,000 debt notice for heating. The building uses a district‑heating system, and a price rise in 2023 left a huge gap between the cost of gas and the bills the tenants paid. After a tribunal said the extra charges were illegal, the case highlighted the need for Ofgem to regulate heat networks and protect renters."
