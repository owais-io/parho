title: "Your Party Membership Chaos Leaves Supporters Frustrated"
summary: "Your Party started with two membership sites that don’t work together. New members can’t cancel their subscriptions because the old site says it’s not authorized and the new one has no access to the money. Many people, including the writer and her husband, have tried emailing, blocking payments, and contacting their bank, but get no help. The party’s leaders say the money was raised through an unauthorized portal and offer refunds, but the process is slow and confusing."
