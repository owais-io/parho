summary: "Janine di Giovanni, a war reporter who spent years recording terror in Syria, Iraq and other countries, says she now sees the same pattern in the United States and Israel. She explains how governments use words like “security” to justify arbitrary arrests, torture, and surveillance. The article warns that fear can replace rules, turning free societies into places where dissent is criminalized and institutions are weakened.
